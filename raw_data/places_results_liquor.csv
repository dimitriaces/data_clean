It feels a little upscale with a nice atmosphere inside and lovely decor. My slice of cake was yummy paired with a latte…. It was perfect for a midday snack! Service was great too - I had a nice conversation with the barista about how the company was started.  The only thing I wish is that they served the coffee in a ceramic mug instead of paper cup - I personally like the feel of a mug and a paper cup takes away from the classy vibe of the place. Overall though, I enjoyed it and will be back!!; A place for a sweet sin, with such a variety of chocolates and pastries it was difficult for me to choose.  The coffee is super tasty.
Cozy place and good service.; The desert in this place are amazing! When you walk in to this place, you are hit with the smell of chocolate. The atmosphere is perfect, I’ve had several of the delicious desserts and I can’t find one that I don’t like but my favorite one has to be the passion fruit cheesecake!; Driving by and saw the sign.

Getting the Paella took more than an hour despite being almost the only guests. Service was friendly but seemed uninterested.; We came here for dinner with a reservation. We arrived 15 min late (after calling only 5 minutes before our reservation time) and the very nice lady -- who I believe also ended up being our server -- was very accommodating and held our table.  When we arrived we ordered as quickly as we could because the kitchen was closing in 30 minutes. We ordered the Chorizo and Ceviche as our tapas and the Mariscos Paella and Mixta Paella (both personal size). The chorizo was very good, served in oil with cheese and onions (almost reminiscent of a French Onion Soup) and accompanied with pita-like triangles. The paellas we're both delicious and served with half a lobster tail. The lobster was a bit overcooked but the seasoning on the paella was great. And the rice wasn't over cooked, it was more on the al dente side which I prefer (but could see some people complaining about that).

The server was so nice and friendly. We did order a bottle of wine and asked if the guy serving would like to try it with us (it's our favorite wine and we were so excited they had it in stock). He declined with a very polite full response that we understood (though, given it's our favorite wine we would have preferred he enjoyed some too never having had it before). All in all a top notch experience.; Donostia, is such a cute little Espada! The  paella de mariscos is good. My favorite was the pechuga de pollo a la parrilla. This dish was tender, juicy, and seasoned to perfection. The music just makes you want to dance and the sangria is a must!; Good tapas and paella. While the prices a little high, food quality and presentation was great. We enjoyed our meal.

Location and parking was easy.; Nov 4th it’s approx 9:13P. Waitress spoke so fast I barely understood her and I speak Spanish.  She 👎 never inquired if we wanted something to drink until we were ready to order our food. I asked what was the “House Specialty” meaning the best selling food on their menu. She replied by saying; We don’t have specials on food. I had to explain what a “House Signature plate” is.  15min went by, I asked to use the bathroom. The Security Guard told me it was for customers only.  🤦‍♀️. I replied: I am a customer. He saw my husband and I come in.  When I was in the bathrooms the bathroom door is so close to the toilet, if I was any bigger I would not fit there. I washed my hands and there was no paper towels.  🫤. I’m about to eat here. If the food is not good, we will not visit again.  I originally gave the. A 3 Star rating but not only the food is good. The Manager went above and beyond expectation to ensure I was satisfied. Hurricane Fiona did sone damaged on the outside of the Restaurant causing my food to get wet with rain.  Not only did they replace my dinner. They also gave me a Sangria on the house.   Thank you guys. I actually work next door. I will tell them my experience and how you went above and beyond. Have a great night.  Food is great worth waiting for. Highly recommend this place.  :-). Extremely Happy at the end."

The waiter recommended us the Chorizo al vino( Spanish sausage with brandy) that comes with a tasty bread and was delicious. We order the pizza that comes in one size with 8 slices thin crust and the taste was very very good.  My daughter's don't like pizza that much and they ate 2 slices each. After that we ate cheesecake (3 different flavor ) and they all were fresh and tasty. To finish our day we order 2 cappuccino and they were delicious.; Wonderful service. Delicious food.

Still a favorite every time we come back to PR.; The pizza crust was reminiscent of the very old school Pizza Hut pan pizza very crispy and very chewy however this was definitely a thin crust pizza with a olive oil and garlic sauce and cheddar cheese. It was absolutely delicious a little on the pricey side as one would expect for artisanal Pizza. Definitely a return visit is an order!; Great place to eat artisanal pizza, plus all types of cheesecakes and cakes. Excellent service from waitress.

I walked out with a 375ml hornitos for about 18 even tho the standard bottle (750ml) is about that price. They make a huge profit off you.; Just look at the pictures of this place, it’s pretty much what you would expect in LA. In other words it’s an old liquor store that hasn’t been updated in 30 years, the prices are high, and the customer service is neither here nor there.

I can’t give them a hard time because this is the usual setting for most small liquor / convenience stores in the city. The reason why I give them 2 stars is because I only come here to buy things like cigarillos, most places charge a $1 for one plus maybe a nickle or dime depending on where you go. But here, depending on whose working or how they’re feeling they always charge me different prices. Before it was always $1.10, after a few times they suddenly changed it to $1.25 but they “would let it slide” that one time. I go again with $1.25 in my pocket and now it’s back to $1.10, last time I went it was now $1.35 (mind you I bring cash and exact change because it’s not enough for a card purchase) so I usually get into some awkward argument with the clerk about how I don’t have enough change because the price keeps changing constantly. I realize it’s pennies on the dollar, but I try to get rid of my change this way and never have change on me otherwise. It sucks they’re trying to squeeze me dry for something as small as a quarter when I know they’d be fine getting anything over a dollar for something like that, especially since I live down the block and am a returning customer.; I love how close this place is to my house prices are a lil steap but that's to be expected in a small store like so. But they usually have my favorite popsicles in stock the bubblegum flavor; I go here almost everyday and they have everything and every snack and juice and soda and the cashiers are so nice they have been working there for years. Mr. Lee used to own it before he died almost 8 years ago; It's been years since I been here. Grew up in this neighborhood. Still good store Friendly new owners"

I recommend you buy your snacks, liquor or other things at the big name supermarkets in the area

This place has a creepy vibe that doesn't care or respect customers; They sell your standard domestic beers, as well as Mexican and Central American beers, and at a fair price. They also sell your standard liquors, as well as some fancier liquors. The folks who run the store at night are good people.

The change I received included a fake $10 bill. The clerks don't vet the bills, and that carelessness can lead an innocent person to some nasty real-world consequences.

The store is a jumble of boxes to the point that it is difficult to walk around. They have a great selection but the bottles are not organized or *priced* much of the time. Some bottles are marked with insane markup, as well. They gave a discount for paying cash. I ended up picking up a bottle, but the chaos on the shelves mars the retail shopping experience.

Shopping online may be a better experience, but their order pickers were struggling to find bottles as well.; I recently ordered several bottles from Old Town Tequila, expecting to receive the products as advertised on their website. However, the bottles I received were different from what was shown online. They mention that they ship the latest from the importer and distributor. Despite this, I still feel misled by the advertising and wish their website had more accurate representations. The response from customer service was don’t  call us or email us to complain about that the bottle image wasn't the exact match of what you ordered vs. received. I hope they can improve their communication and clarity to better meet customer expectations.; The middle eastern man came out to follow my black boyfriend after he bought a bottle from him. He was yelling at my boyfriend saying “you can park here! “ when we were walking out the front door after making our purchase.

We tried to explain to him we made a purchase inside the store but he did not care he said we cannot park in front of the store.

I I will advise to not go here there customer service is obviously racially motivated.; Amar the so called “manager” racially profiled me and my friend after just making a purchase. He is absolutely ridiculous we purchased a drink from there just to try it  and as we got into the car he told us we have to leave only customers can park there. this guy is absolutely unprofessional. Can’t believe he has the title of a manager. Telling someone to leave the parking lot after just purchasing from them doesn’t give you a raise buddy. Followed us outside just to tell us we had to leave.; Old Town Tequila always have the hard to find Tequila I am looking for in stock with great pricing. The packaging is always well done without issues. Highly recommend this company!"

From the moment I walked in, Jared went above and beyond to assist me. I was looking for a specific bottle of whiskey, and not only did he help me find it, but he also took the time to recommend a few other options that matched my taste preferences. His knowledge about different spirits was impressive, and he was incredibly patient as I asked questions.

The store itself is well-stocked with a wide variety of selections, but what really sets this place apart is the level of customer service. Jared's professionalism and friendly attitude made my visit truly exceptional. If you're in need of a great recommendation or just want top-notch service, ask for Jared at Flagstaff Liquor. Highly recommend this place!; I usually don’t leave reviews for places until I’ve been there a few times. But, Flagstaff Liquor earned this one for sure.

I stopped by for quite a while with a lot of questions - namely logistics and procuring certain things for my upcoming wedding in September. I was immediately greeted at the door by a wonderful vendor advertising his products. I was able to sample and talk and he was an absolute G. I wish I wrote this earlier because I’ve forgotten their names but he was a great guy. When he packed up he had poured and left me a little sample of some local red wine! That was cool.

The workers there were great. Two lovely gentlemen that answered all of my questions and showed me how ordering worked. They gave me plenty of options they could procure on some wines from France I wanted to look into for the wedding, as well as expected prices and dates the shipments would arrive. I definitely wasn’t expecting the level of service and care I got as some random dude walking in, but it was immaculate.

I checked the humidor too, which is absolutely huge and very well taken care of and presented originally just looking for a general sense of pricing for boxes of cigars. One of the guys (he had a nose ring and piercings and was an absolute gem) introduced himself to me as the cigar manager of the place. He really knows his stuff. We talked cigars and options and while chatting made some recommendations that seemed so good that I walked out of there with single sticks of a couple. He also hooked me up with some cedar matches for them in the bag which was awesome. I’ve already smoked the recommendations and they were supreme.

It’s hard sometimes to find a business in Flag that really cares about their clientele, and these guys absolutely reached the mark. Hell, I even walked out of there with my favorite Japanese beer for a fantastic price to boot.

Overall, the atmosphere is super solid. The staff is clearly passionate and knowledgeable on many levels. The staff is super engaging and friendly, the prices are good, and the selection of everything I saw was fantastic. They’re flexible and willing to work with you to get what you need, within reason, of course.

I’ll definitely be coming back for my non-Modelo needs. They really earned all the rave reviews and the word around town. Whoever works there and runs this place deserves a pat on the back because they’re crushing it. Cheers guys and gals!; First experience here and absolutely love the vibe. Found everything I was looking for and then some! Staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming. Maddie greeted me and Marc helped me choose some cigars (which I know nothing about and he was happy to spend some time explaining). I appreciate the knowledge and attention to details. I will most definitely be back with my husband and hopefully joining you all on the patio on Thursdays!; Wide selection of what looks like everything!
My wife and I were looking at extra anejo tequilas, and honestly, we are very novice about tequila. Luckily, the guy was up from their Prescott store (that sounds friggin' awesome, btw) and jumped to our rescue! Super friendly, super knowledgeable, and super helpful!!! I suspect he saved me from making an amateur mistake and has helped us with our first step of our tequila adventure :).
Thanks man!!!; It's newer, but it's easily one the best liquor stores in Flagstaff.  There are only 2 liquor stores in town that deserve your business, and this is one   They host a lot of tastings and have the largest selection in Flagstaff.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  Most importantly, they treat their regular customers well.  Most of the other places in town only care regular customers when it comes to common items.  As soon as they get something good, it goes in their museum cases to hold out for out of towners with deep pockets.  Instead of rewarding their loyal local customers like they should, whose purchases allow them to get those allocated items in the first place.

What other liquor store would break open bottles like Thomas Handy, George T Stagg and Pappy 15yr to give out samples  of to everyone at some of their events."

I could not even report her rudeness to the manager because he/she was not at the store. The manager not being there was very strange to me!!! Leaves one to wonder, who's running the store?!

It's not only a chance to see authentic production methods up close, but you'll also gain invaluable knowledge about the art of rum-making.; Definitely worth a visit.

Authentic tour and loved the history. Every one said go to bacardi. Thats not my style, I am so glad  that I never listen to what everyone says. I found out about this beautiful and local distillery.

You will not be disappointed from the amazing landscapes to the variety of tastings,conversations and laughs about family and life.
Thank you to the Alverez family for sharing your incredible story with us. Can't wait to come back.

Kat and Jason; Ellen and I had a wonderful experience for pre- tour coffee and croissant and during the tour.  Gabby was awesome in her presentation of the coffee plantation’s history  and the coffee.  She was witty and made it interesting to all ages.  The coffee is some of the best I have had in a long time.  I would 100% recommend this tour to anyone.  I cannot wait until our next trip to Hacienda Munoz.; The tour was so much fun! We met Pepe first who was very passionate about this business he created. His hard work was very admirable and he gave us a brief history of sugar cane in Puerto Rico. Monica, our tour guide was fantastic and she was very knowledgeable. We had a lot of questions and she easily answered every single one. We saw every step of the rum making process which was much cooler than other rum tours that only offered tastings. The tasting was great and we bought two bottles at the end. Great time all around and I would highly recommend. (Also they spoke great English)"

Thank you Cupid's for maintaining the tradition.; 5/5 ⭐️’s… Here is MY OPINION: Cupid’s Daiquiri located on Louisiana Avenue here in Lafayette, LA is my favorite Daiquiri spot! They have the best flavors, especially with premium alcohol. It does not matter who comes to the window the customer service personnel is always friendly, and very knowledgeable about products and suggestions, and I love an establishment that has rewards!!! You get a punch card and after so many visits you get a free daiquiri. Sometimes they even hand out free Jell-O shots!! I  love free!! My favorite daiquiri is the “Henn-Dog” which is a premium daiquiri but please be careful because they make daiquiris taste like snow cones, nice and soft but formed ice, not too bitter, just the right amount of sweetness, I refuse to complain. I have been coming here probably as long as they have been in this location and let me tell ya, again, no complaints! I don’t care how many people are in line, they are still able to maintain service well without a long wait! I actually would not mind waiting because I am always greeted with the best service and I have never been disappointed. I’ll wait!! 😛 Thank you Cupid 💘 for your awesomeness!!!!; So good yall! Service is always friendly & quick. So many different delicious flavors and they are not light-handed with the liquor!; Fast friendly service, and lots of tasty selections. I noticed mention of a VIP card on the window, but didn't get one, and forgot to ask after going 2 nights in a row. I'll be back to try more flavors.; First time going here. Not much of a drinker, but I was lonely and it's new years eve so I said why not.  The service was quick and I had no idea they were soo inexpensive.  The daiquiri tastes really good too. Very happy with everything overall."

I have AT&T service and didn’t have any cell service inside. I was trying to take pictures of the beer selection to then go research on untapped (a beer and brewery app) outside to figure out what I wanted. The worker accused me of working for a company, (what company, I have no idea) and told me I had to leave. They lost my business, I probably would have spent close to 100 dollars on beer since we are only in town for a couple of days and like to pick up local brews wherever we go. Being told to leave for trying to look up beers on untapped, that’s a new one. Worst experience I’ve had at a liquor store and I’ve had many, won’t be back if we’re ever back in the area.

FYI, I found a great selection of local beers at Big Liquor Warehouse about 8 minutes down the road and they were happy to have my business and let me research beers for 20 minutes before checking out.; Very impolite staff and owner.

Yes, I've had to wait 2 to 3 weeks for my shipment, but at the prices and quality offered, I am perfectly fine with this. ( I do have a nice variety of wine at my house so I can wait for additional bottles.)  My biggest issue is with UPS not being able to provide an accurate delivery time.
I will continue to purchase and enjoy the descriptive of each wine.  I do check prices via a quick Google search as sometimes they are not always the best price.   All in all, I think this is a great way to purchase some quality wine.; I have been using this site for a couple of months as a good friend sent it to me. I always order the right amount needed to get free shipping. I did look closely at the past orders and I have been getting charged for shipping even thought I meet the free shipping minimum.

After receiving a few emails over the week, I was told that all of the orders had been ""lost in transit."" All 16 orders? Very disappointing...I thought I had found a new source to fill my cellar, but it appears that Last Bottle sells wine, then creates reasons that they can't deliver.; I stopped ordering from them years ago  because of absurdly slow shipping (3-4 weeks). I left them and began shopping with one of their competitors who always ships the following business day of my order. I decided to try Last Bottle again in hopes that they corrected the slow shipping issue, but they haven’t. They immediately printed a shipping label but It’s been 8 days since my order with no movement. This will definitely be my last purchase from them…it’s just worth the aggravation of having to wait so long.; Regrettably, my experience with Last Bottle Wines has been underwhelming, echoing the sentiments expressed by others. Having used their services on numerous occasions, I fear it may be the last time due to inconsistent shipping schedules and poor communication. Any cost savings I may have experienced are far outweighed by the time wasted attempting to obtain an order update.

Moreover, I share the frustration of another reviewer regarding the daily offering of wines, only to face weeks of waiting for an order to arrive. Although I strive to support small businesses, a lack of fundamental customer service draws a clear line for me."

Updated review and last edit, NEVER USE APPLE PAY. Safer with Cash but still beware of overcharging & added fees & remember.

This issue has been in claims covering past nearly 3 months but was difficult to track with so many micro purchases but was obvious was only this merchant. Though became most obvious this last month as I was monitoring however unfortunately you can’t prove that charge wasn’t yours because you can’t prove that you weren’t there.

So forced to cancel my Apple Pay as you can’t single out and block a merchant. Found out prior & to more certainty recent monitoring as I said above my account was indeed being charged multiple but random days from this merchant of which I never even visited the store; and this issue has only been from this store. So since I have no idea how my account was accessed had no choice & just issued an advisory to my credit account & blocked the account.

No matter how friendly a merchant may come across, never trust any Merchant.; A very good convenient store with a very friendly owner thats a plus.; Dont water your time hard to get in then you get yelled by owner and big security guy intimidating you; Workers are unnecessarily aggressive with customers over us staying there a few minutes; The lady there was very nice.

Their bright and flashy time make them hard to miss and is a clear indicator that it’s party time :); I love this licor, has parking, a lot of goodies. And i love the service very polite, makes you want to back and purchase.; My absolute favorite local liquor store.

touch.  I spent about 10 minutes over there and was quite shocked, that liquor owners knew most of the customers by name and what was going on in their life. Also, this is the key to a small business where they don’t count you as a number but consider you their client. awesome"

How convenient and it is the only non-duty liquor store in the US from what I read. They claim that their prices are the same as the liquor stores on the Strip. The vibe is really cool, and they stack the bottles like books in a library, hence their store name. They have liquor, wine, and craft beer.  The store is beautiful and decorated in a white theme.

The manager was very welcoming, and she helped us find a bottle of Casamigos, lime squeeze, soda water, and a Figi 6-pack of bottled water.  I also bought a jeweled Las Vegas water cup with a cap and straw. We will definitely return next time we are in Vegas.; When I found that the prices were too high, I walked to the area across the street from the airport. I discovered that the prices there were much more affordable. A helpful African American employee advised me to make my purchase from outside, and her recommendation turned out to be spot on.; I walked in and spent 5 minutes looking for something in a store I had never been in while a group of people who worked there stood in a corner and ignored me. After finally finding what I wanted, I paid for my wine, and it was put in a bag, placed on the counter and the salesperson turned their back on me. No thank you, have a nice day, nothing. Customer service is supposed to actually a thing.; Just visited this store last night within the Las Vegas aiport. This was my husband's first time in Vegas, my second time. We were looking forward to buying a variety of liquors as we like to enjoy and host gatherings back home. When we walked into the store, the two young ladies working were having a conversation. They looked at us and kept talking...no greeting. They didn't ask how can they assist us...nothing. They continued their conversation and we decided not to purchase anything. On our way out, they did not say anything to us. However, a white gentleman walks in and to our dismay, they greeted him by saying ""Welcome in!"" They did not say one word to us but greeted the white gentleman as if his patronage was more important. They lost our business and we WILL NOT be purchasing from this store or any if it's affiliates. Whoever the store manager is, please speak with your staff about being polite to ALL CUSTOMERS.; Expensive.  If you want bottles at non strip prices. Total wine and more is a quick lyft/Uber trip south strip."

The selection here is small compared to other larger liquor chains.

The staff here is not very friendly and not very helpful. Some have attitudes!; I've shopped here many times but today I was asked to leave my purse while shopping. This made me uncomfortable since I had a few hundred dollars worth of beauty products from the Ulta across the street as well as cash and cards. They advised me to remove it!!! You want me to walk around with the contents of my purse in order to shop? No sir. This is the stupidest thing I've seen and it clearly just started. Though the store is minutes from my home, I shop at Walmart, Total Wine or even the grocery store before I allow minimum wage workers to keep  my belongings. There's too many other options for this to be a resolution for theft. Maybe walk the store and not stand at the door and register...maybe ask can you go get what I want? But asking customers to remove content is unacceptable. Do better. Think outside the box. Whomever came up with this should be fired for stupidity. The stores selection is not large enough for this!!!!!!; This store is right off of the 215 - perfect for stopping off on your way to Summerlin from the airport.

I would like to thank the staff for making a great first impression on me because it does make big difference.; Amazing inside, large the quality of choices is crazy. The selections of specialty and local brew choices makes me excited to support our local businesses. The cashier was kind, there was so many staff in the store working. The only downfall was the lack of good customer service on the floor, many many workers were very passive. The variety of small liquor bottles was a disappointment. The cashier was patient and was very knowledgeable on sales and reward programs they offer.

I was looking for a specific item went in with picture and all so not to waste time I found someone showed then and they knew where to go. I would not have found it because apparently the company had changed their branding label bit the guy knew  what he was doing and looking for and I appreciated that. At check out the lady was very friendly and also signed me up for their rewards program. So yes I would recommend for their fast, knowledgeable and friendly service 😊gold label original, black label new. P.S it was for a gift so had to be this specific one lol; They have a great selection of Liquor my only suggestion would be liquor gift baskets!!!; It seems smaller but very well organized and signs above the shelves to locate general items. The price tags are electronic or maybe WiFi tags and prices are clearly labeled but lighting may cause some reflection. They have all the basics and I was easily able to select some cheaper wines to fill my display rack. I was looking for single packs of white claw in lemon but they carry only variety packs. I wanted to stay longer and view all the aisles but I had to get home. It was an easy drive from work down Lake Mead until you reach Eastgate. Then the traffic is jammed with people trying to get on the I-215. Maybe take a back road."

If you plan to go to the Chris’s Place bar behind this store, I would it some shots here, since the drinks are very watered down.

The store associates trying to strike up a convo with every single customer and getting mad if the customer just wants to chose their items, pay, and leave without talking to them can make the experience tiresome and uncomfortable.
