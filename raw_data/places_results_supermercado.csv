The store is very clean and well-organized, and the staff is nice. They have a bakery section with delicious cupcakes and cakes, and their fresh produce is top-notch. Everything here looked really nice. Highly recommended!; Store is clean. Beautiful flowers. Great produce, bakery. Paul has the best customer service out of everyone.; I moved to Canyon Crest 14 years ago and Ralph's was my go to store because of the convenience and for friendly employees but because of what they have done with their checkout service I will drive 5 miles away to Stater Bros because who actually have friendly employees working their checkout lanes. They have ZERO SELF CHECKOUTS! Last night 09/19/2024 I went in Ralph's just to grab some lettuce and beer. They had closed down one side of their self checkouts, 6 in total. They only had 2 employees that had their checkout lanes opened and the other 6 self checkouts opened. Customers were standing in lines going halfway down their food aisles which was causing a huge mess with other customers trying to walk around the store to grab items and whatnot. After realizing it was going to about 20 minutes of standing in line I just put what I had down in the aisle and walked out. What a joke! All of this inconvenienced because some big wig thought it would be better to have less employees for customer service by letting their own customers check themselves out just hoping to save money. That is insulting to your customers. I will now drive the extra 5 miles to stand in line to interact with the friendly employees of Stater Brothers. They usually have at least 7 to 8 checkout lanes opened at any given time. I give Ralph's a Big Fat 0 for Customer Service.; I love Canyon Crest Town Center and for many years have enjoyed shopping at Ralph’s until recently. I love the location, the variety, the prices, but the thing that I don’t like is the fact that whenever I go there, there is usually just one check stand open. I don’t like using self check out so this has caused me to go to Stater Brothers, which is further away from my home but where I know I can get a clerk to check me out without a problem. That being said, I want to give a shout out to cashier Natalie C. I ended up having to go to Ralph’s yesterday because I was in a hurry and didn’t want to drive further away to Stater Brothers. As usual, there was only one check stand open and it was hers. There was a long line and when I finally got up to her, she was pleasant and  accommodating, despite the fact that I could tell she was frustrated that there were no other checkers working. This woman deserves a raise. And let me know when you have more checkers working and I will gladly go to Ralph’s on a more regular basis.; This Ralph’s is amazing. Sounds funny, I know, but I am a big fan of this particular location. It is always well organized, clean, and has the friendliest staff. Great selection and a cleverly planned floor plan that prevents long lines and keep things moving. The V-day balloon displays yesterday were so gorgeous I had to take a picture."

Once i shown my receipt they all looked at the ground feeling bad besides the older lady. Please do better and focus on the real shop lifters and not your day to day customers. There was a man who ran out with the alarm ringing and all and somehow their main focus was me :(; Recently while in the parking lot if fry’s.  One of the cart boys named mason, wasn’t paying attention to what he was doing and Plowed a stack of carts into my car, putting 3 nice sized dents into my passenger side door.   I reported it to the stores manager.     They came out and looked at the car.    Saw the damage.    But now the store is saying they aren’t responsible  for the damage to my car.    The dents are deep and cannot be rubbed out.    Whole door needs replaced.   I hope it’s worth the loss of business.  I will never shop at fry’s again.; This Fry's has clothes and a larger non-food section than most. The bakery, deli, and produce departments are fairly standard for Fry's but seem to have a bit better management than most stores. The men's room was exceptionally clean this morning which, frankly was better than expectation. I always like to stop by the ""clearance"" section in the back to search for treasures.; If you don’t mind being harassed by persistently annoying cell phone salesmen, zoned out delivery pickers cutting you off, and the occasional disgruntled cashier, the prices are good and most of the peeps that work there are very nice.

Produce, when stocked, is reasonably fresh and solid on quality/consistency.

Center aisles are inconsistently stocked and maintenance/cleanliness seem to be a secondary priority.

No reason to buy meat products here.  They’re very mediocre.  Quality and price gap way too wide not to make the separate trip to Costco.

Deli is disappointing.  Food quality is iffy and every other staffer is surely or indifferent.

I do like the pleasant familiarity and friendliness of most of the checkers and baggers.  The prices are definitely good, but the trajectory has definitely been downward over the years.   I can only imagine when Kroger/Albertson’s merge.; On July 11th, around 5 PM, I went to the store to purchase an Amazon gift card. I waited about 2 minutes at the customer service counter, as there was no one there. Eventually, a woman named Kristine came out. She greeted me in a very unfriendly and impatient manner, not even saying hello, and just asked what I needed.

I told her I needed an Amazon gift card, and she asked how much I wanted. Since I'm not fully comfortable with English, I asked her to repeat the question, and she responded by raising her voice and sounding annoyed, asking again how much of the gift card I wanted. I was really upset by her rude and unprofessional attitude. As a customer service representative, I cannot believe she would treat a customer, especially one with limited English skills, in such a dismissive and irritated way.

I wonder if Kristine treats all customers this way, or if she was discriminating against me because I am Asian. After I placed the money on the counter instead of handing it to her directly, she sighed heavily and gave me a disapproving look.

I had purchased an Amazon gift card, but I told the employee Kristine that I did not want to earn rewards points on that purchase. However, despite my request, Kristine went ahead and used her own shopper's card to earn the rewards points on your gift card purchase. This action by the employee seems inappropriate. Typically, store employees should only apply rewards points to a customer's card if the customer explicitly requests it. By using her own card without my consent, Kristine appears to be trying to personally benefit, rather than respecting the customer's wishes.

This kind of behavior by the employee may go against the store's policies. Customers should have the right to decide whether or not to earn rewards on their purchases, and the employee should not override that without the customer's approval.

This kind of poor customer service and potential discrimination is unacceptable. The store and the Fry's company as a whole should take action to address Kristine's behavior and ensure all customers are treated with respect, regardless of their language skills or background."

It has most of the Asian produce and products with some amazing weekly discounts/deals. The store is organized but has sales items all throughout the store, making it feels and looks messy. Food court also includes a bakery and many different food options. I didn’t eat there, but they were busy. Weekly specials are great buys, items were new and fresh, unlike some stores has the almost expired items on sale! Staff are friendly and remind customers of super deals. During my visits, I saw people buying by the dozen on the sale items. It can keep the place cleaner to attract customers.; Very nice people! Very clean store looking for something you're only going to find in an Asian market this is the place to go; It's your typical Asian Supermarket.
They do have lots of live seafood. The price are usually good value.; Has a lot of groceries, fresh meats, veggies, spices and sauces. Good selection of asian snacks and instant noodles too. There are a couple small stall/shops inside as well, one selling electrodomestics and the other selling fried snacks (I think it's currently closed due to covid). Theres also a cooked food/deli and a small bakery section. Never had an issue here."

We had party on last Sunday, and I went to 168 market bought 3 box fresh young coconut for my friends.

And when we opened box was shocked! I can’t believe the conditions of 168 Market fruits.

I was glad service center’s attitude was nice and returned fast. I asked why don’t you guys check it before selling it. They told me: we won’t know until open it”

No comment no judgment, please see pictures below and be careful with their fruits.; They have ample variety of Asian goods. Price is reasonable. The store as a whole is clean. The staff are good -some friendlier than others but overall good. I love their hotfood area and bakery. Bought their cakes several times for birthday celebrations. The cakes are reasonably priced and taste very good and light. Bought the mango cake with fresh fruits on top.; One stop of a grocery shopping  place , 168 super market provides me with conveniences and affordability . It has a variety of Asian products as well as daily necessities .  I love to shop in its vegetable sections that are full of fresh Asian  fruits and vegetables . It also has a unique food court that offers Chinese breakfast and a lunch menu  . It has a bakery department that provides cakes , sweet treats and bread . Compared with other super markets ,  I enjoy its reasonable product prices . 168 Super market is my favorite super market .; The market is a bit dingy and underlit. It doesn't offer a lot of things, just the basic necessities. It is located in an affluent neighborhood but it doesn't live up to expectations. And the food is decent at best.; The BOGO deals are a great catch and the fruit is really fresh.
The only downside is that some of the meat for hotpot doesn't look as fresh as it seems."

Of course I ended up shopping far longer than I intended to as I need to check out this store lol.

I really don’t understand the negative reviews as this store has everything and so many specialty sections. They even sell clothes and shoes! I didn’t browse those sections as I’m sure I’m not going to find clothes that suit my taste in a grocery store, but still kinda impressive.

I loved they had an olives and anti pasta bar for $9.99/pound. Ended up buying for some hubby!

One cool thing that I have never seen is their cooler section with all kinds of different drinks. It has pictures and prices of all the drinks inside. How creative and cool is that!!

They also have a sushi bar with lots of rolls for $6. I have tried their sushi and really don’t have any desire to try again but it’s convenient. The cheese section is vast and if you’re a cheese lover, you’ll be in heaven! They also have a huge kitchen section with gadgets, dishes, bowls, and appliances. Again, a very convenient one stop store.

I was puzzled why the store was so crowded until another shopper told me it was senior citizens day. If you’re over 55 years of age, you get an additional 10 percent off your groceries! I was told it’s on the first Wednesday of each month. Great info as it applies to any sale items too.

If I’m in the area, I’d definitely stop in again.; Not my favorite store considering most of what they sell is from all of the horrible corporations that produce unhealthy foods laced with drug science which gets us addicted & sick.  Not a conspiracy anymore, now it’s becoming more of our collective common knowledge.  The people who work here are great people.  Don’t get me wrong.  They have great customer service and some decent prices.; Poor customer service, we bagged our groceries while employees just stood around. The cashier didn’t even say hello as we unloaded our groceries. I hope Publix comes to the valley.; Great Management and staff. I do online orders both for Fry's and instacart so I'm in the store daily , I'm impressed w/how clean this location always is and how much the employees and managers are always offering me help when I need it. SO appreciated !; This is my neighborhood fry’s. I’ve been shopping here since they opened a few years ago. I spend $1k on groceries here each month & i will no longer be shopping here.

This store has terrible management & the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced anywhere! The employees are rude & sometimes mean. The only people working here who have ever been friendly to me are the deli and cheese counter. While I could spend way too much time elaborating on each negative experience I’ve had on every occasion in this store, I’ll spare you & make a couple suggestions.

1) do not work here!!! You can tell the employees are miserable & mistreated.

2) do not shop here. There’s a fry’s on power/ baseline, recker/williams field, & a new location opening at Elliot/power, as well as a Safeway & sprouts across the street. Avoid this store!!!! It’s really the worst & it is a shame."

I will definitely go back.; Cool little Mexican Market, well… not so little lol. They have just about everything you’ll need. From different types of meat, to detergent, to Mexican candies, and fruits.

The shop looks clean and well organized. The staff was nice, at least the cashiers were.

We came here just to check the place out. It was recommended by a friend of ours. No complaints, it was a cool find here in Lake Forest.

Bought a watermelon, and some Mexican candies lol.; So here is the deal.   I am half afraid to share this because this place is a gem 💎!    I can buy wonder marinated meats.. ceviche.. dairy.. chicharron.. and a bunch of produce and hit only $80.   Sometimes $70 and sometimes $50.    They have a smoothie bar that’s probably the best one around…. As the produce is right there,   The fresh produce looks better and is ripe and great looking and better than Bristol farms or whole paycheck.   It’s a fast shopping store with a fresh hot food to go as well - and it’s aaaahmazing!!   do not expect big grocery carts here.   It’s fresh ripe food that you eat this week or in the next few days.   I truly love this shop as it’s perfect for me by myself and even better when there were more of us.   Just for reference they had beautifully RIPE RED SWEET SMELLING strawberries for under $3 a pack,  like RIPE RED strawberries- not those white topped unripe hard bland berries like at a regular store.  Really.   Even the butcher shop is really really awesome.  It is not the same as a big grocery store chain but everything has been fantastic.   I don’t speak Spanish but every single person there has been great and it’s nice to shop in a place without having to listen to the obnoxious thinly veiled racism from other customers directed at others.   Bravo to this store.   You could in fact get all your weekly groceries here just fine.   I mostly do -  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️; Love the meat market and vegetables etc lots of stuff from my country.; They really need to work on keeping their floors clean, couldn’t push the store cart with out getting stuck with what was on the floor.

Careful with the cakes slices in the case though. I bought 2 of them at $6 each and they were stale and hard. Had to throw them out.

Update:  That was a great owner reaction.  I just moved here and am not used to having someone from the business actually care about making it a better experience.  Thank you.  I don't need anything to make it better but fresh cake for next time.    It looked  incredible.  I look forward to trying it again.

Also, you are the only store around here that I've found so far who carries my favorite coffee.  Community breakfast blend.

The prices here are *unrealistically high* compared to other nearby stores like Selectos, Sam's Club, Walmart, and even smaller local grocery stores. For a store that’s supposed to provide competitive pricing, it feels like they’re taking advantage of the local community with their overpriced products.

In addition to the steep prices, the *parking lot is a complete mess*. Navigating the area is chaotic, and pushing your cart to the car is an unnecessary struggle due to the poor layout and uneven pavement. It’s incredibly inconvenient and adds to the overall frustrating experience.

With so many other, better-priced grocery stores around, I *highly encourage customers to look elsewhere* for their grocery shopping needs. Between the prices and the parking hassle, it’s just not worth it.; Huge breakfast sandwiches served in the bakery area,  enough for two people, the cafe con leche and cheese flan is great too; They only have two cashiers they want you to use the automatic cashier machine. I won't shop there anymore I'll shop somewhere else also and most importantly over the past 25 years I have purchased a ton of bad meat from the store.

They are only face-lifting their stores themselves, not actual quality of their food, better selections etc, just stores and landscaping lift. This walmart has made the whole store self check (While I literally see at least 5 employees walking around just cleaning the scanners on the self check outs at 6am) outs besides maybe 3 or 4 very small registers while complaining about thefts and locking everything up aka will take more time to shop instead of hiring security. I'm assuming they will with all walmarts eventually so get ready to check out your own groceries after working 10+ hour days the rest of your life. Beyond ridiculous. I wonder how the multi billionaire family owners, presidents and CEOs of these companies, meals look like..  walmart made 153 billion in profit this year (Ending in 2023). They are putting 9 billion in store face-lifts. Not because walmart has the worst selections and quality in food and furniture. Flower, vitamin etc selection is a joke. They lock up eye drops, make you press a button, wait for an employee and then they walk you to a register to pay for them etc.... 😳🤦🏼 The frozen bags of chicken nuggets etc is a good idea but in true walmart fashion, has the smallest openings possible to pour the food out. You can tell instantly the difference in quality from ""great value"" foods from other great known brand foods. Employees don't say one word to you when ringing you up aka pretty awkward for me and or just rude etc. I don't expect anything less from a kid nowadays working at walmart. The amount of employees just walking around compared to the empty registers is mind blowing on a daily basis. Store opens at 6am, no one on registers until 8 or 9am 👌🏻. We live in Maryvale so its another hassle for us paycheck to paycheck peeps. 👏🏻 Stores are always messy, dirty with milk stains on cartons/ refrigerator doors. You can tell in any walmart, they only care about profit, period. Especially the ""Grab your attention"" useless garbage you buy on an impulse and the beyond extra security measures now. 👌🏻; I love how they have the checkout area,  I've never had to wait long for a kiosk. Since I use the scan and go it's even faster for me, all I have to do is scan the QR code on the register and bounce!; Really bad experience front and supervisor stated she was short of staff but her employees walking around playing around singing and doing all the type of other things they sure were not working but yet money center had a line wrapped around the store with one employee; First thing is it was extremely packed. You pretty much had to stand in lines just to get to get anywhere in the store. The staff is really to busy to help you and they were out of alot of stuff. The only reason I gave this store 4 ⭐ was because there was one young lady who worked there that took the time (without me having to ask) to help find my kitten food (Which of course, they were also out of).If it wasn't for her I would have given this place 2 ⭐ cause anyone else that I had asked for help hardly even looked in my direction.; This Walmart uses to be horrible back in the day, now a days it is so nice, clean and always having new items for me to snag up! Especially when it comes to laundry soap and they now have a great value laundry bead's! Smells amazing !! They really have cleaned up the place check it out for yourself ✨🙏 Thank you Walmart for overly  meeting my expectations!

This delightful plaza offers a variety of shops and services, catering to the diverse needs of locals and tourists alike. With an Econo grocery store, a couple of banks, All Ways 99, Bargain City, and more, this plaza has become my go-to spot for everyday essentials and last-minute shopping.

One of the standout features of the Cabo Rojo Shopping Plaza is its convenience. The Econo grocery store, in particular, offers a wide selection of fresh produce, household items, and pantry staples, making it easy to pick up everything you need in one trip. The All Ways 99 and Bargain City stores are perfect for finding affordable and quality items for home, clothing, and various knick-knacks.

The plaza's layout is user-friendly, with ample parking spaces and easy navigation between stores. The banks located within the shopping center provide added convenience for those needing to take care of financial transactions or access ATMs.

However, the one minor drawback I experienced at the Cabo Rojo Shopping Plaza was the occasional delay in exiting the plaza due to the red light traffic. While it can be a bit frustrating to wait for the light to change during peak hours, I find that the convenience and variety of stores available within the plaza far outweigh this minor inconvenience.

Overall, the Cabo Rojo Shopping Plaza is a fantastic shopping destination for anyone in the area. With its array of shops and services, it's easy to see why it's a favorite among locals and visitors alike. Just remember to be patient when exiting during busy times, and you'll find that the Cabo Rojo Shopping Plaza is well worth the visit."

Terrible service from Daniela who is the one “in charge”. Claiming the store was closed at 10:30 when it was actually 11. She has a nasty attitude and kept yelling back in forth inside the store. El super needs to do better with who they select as leaders. Please train your employee properly or do not hire them at all. Not a good look. Disappointed is the least I could say.; This is the supermarket we go to every week to buy fruits and vegetables. Their fruits and vegetables are very fresh. The shrimps are also of good quality.
They also have Midengao ice cream. The taste and texture of childhood.
This is a very good lifestyle supermarket.; DANIELA IS HORRIBLE!!!!! I wish I could leave zero stars. I walked into the store 15 minutes before they closed. My sister and I were looking at the cakes for my moms birthday and one of the vey nice workers there saw us and he said that if we wanted a cake , we ask the cashier and she'll get it for us. We proceeded to buy some candles and Hilda the cashier checked us out on Lane 9. She was very kind . When we asked for a cake, she called the manager Daniela on the speaker. Daniela yells from all the way across 8 registers to say in Spanish ""At this time no, it's too late, we can't give them a cake"". She was very rude, dismissive, disrespectful and unprofessional. I don't understand why they have someone like that working there. I'm calling corporate, this is unacceptable. They are obligated to help us out even if we are there 5 minutes before they close. Terrible!!!!!; I usually go to this Market once per week with my mother-in-law and my wife. The market is always very crowded, but we still go there. There is an old guy who sweeps the floor and for three times on different visits he bumps his broom into my foot even though there's no trash around me and I told him, in Spanish, what's going on? why do you keep following me through the whole store? My wife and her mom are Mexican and I am a white guy. I am starting to feel unwelcome in this store and that the older sweeper man is a RACIST toward me and that's why he keeps trying to sweep my feet even with no trash near my feet And just for this reason I'm never going back to that store. I didn't get the name of the sweeper guy, but he is an older Latino guy that always works on Wednesday afternoons when I go there.; My wife and I have been shopping at  El Super when looking for good deals on produces,meats and house hold items.

Very nice layout.  Everything seemed stocked  and neatly placed.
Like to give a shout out to Annie in the meat department for providing over the top customer service, by being right there,  being extremely friendly, and taking great care of us.; What happened to this Fry's? First, the trash under the shopping cart area by the front door was awful.  Then a lady not paying attention to her kids in the way of my cart yelled at me after I kindly said excuse me twice to get past and then wouldn't apologize after.  Then the cashier barely said hi after I said good morning.  Then there was no one bagging in my lane so the cashier had to do it.  I
thought I should help but I pay more for a store like this to not have to bag my own groceries.  I did thank him and wished him a good day and he did not reply.  Definitely will not be back.; I like the size of this location and the convenience of it being down the street from my home. HOWEVER, I'm seriously considering going to a different location or business altogether because of the AT&T sales people. When people are grocery shopping, esp. post-pandemic, they don't want to be approached and harassed about a new cell phone plan. As a woman shopping alone or coming after a long day at work, it feels uncomfortable and inappropriate to be stared down and approached by a salesman and have to hear the whole spiel. It completely ruins the shopping experience. Based on other reviews, it doesn't look like this will be addressed.; Worst Fry's in Phoenix!! Every time I go to this store it's trashy & the employees are lazy, I had a gift card tried scanning it like it said but that didn't work so I asked cashier for help...she did what I did & scanned it but something wasn't right & instead of trying to figure it out for me she tossed her hands up like whatever and said she didn't know maybe the system's messed up & walked away. Lol, people are so lazy and do not want to do their job. So I paid with my debit card and left it at that still have the gift card that I will be using when I go to a correct store that knows how to operate.; I saw a gentleman checking out at self checkout and as he was checking out I noticed another gentleman who appeared to be a manager interrupted the man who was checking out and asked him about a bottle of pills. Saying to him, where are the pills you had in your cart. The man who was checking out answered, ""I put them back on the shelf."" The manager repeatedly asked the gentleman to tell him or show him where the bottle of pills were put back and completely harass this man that was checking out. The man told the manager feel free to look in my bags. I also noticed there was a Phoenix police officer there who I believed the store had called on the gentleman checking out. I don't understand why they(manager of Fry's or associate) would accuse someone of stealing presumably on how the gentleman looked that was checking out. He had a beard long hair tattoos and wearing all black. However, I can not assume why the accused that man, but it would appear that way. It really made me uncomfortable as a custimer because I don't want to shop at a store of any kind where they feel that they need to have police presence nor do I want to possibly be accused of stealing something based off of my appearance. The gentleman finished checking out and left without the police officer making any contact with the man that the manager accused of shoplifting. I will no longer return to that location."

For years, I've been disappointed. Don't even consider the high prices. Produce is often over ripe, dairy is past its sell-by date, and staff consistently opens later and closes earlier than posted hours. No one cares; The only reason I am giving this review four stars instead of five is because the downstairs mart is very expensive ($7 for gluten free loaf as opposed to maybe $5 in the States), and the upstairs cafe service time can be a little slow (but that’s because everything is made to-order).

Besides those notes, the food is very tasty given the price tags (surprisingly low!). A meal for me and my wife was about $15 to share delicious oatmeal, have a scramble sandwich for her, and gluten free pancakes for me. They have fruit and nutella options to top the pancakes and french bread, and they have multi-grain and sourdough options for the sandwich type bread and french bread.

They also have pizzas, smoothies, and salads—but I didn’t try any of them.

Love this place, and I will be back if I come to San Juan again!; Parking is always available, a bit on the pricier end, but they have gluten-free and allergen free options that can't be found elsewhere.; Excellent customer service.The store has parking. They have everything you need when it comes to healthy products that are hard to find in regular supermarkets. Store is clean, modern and fully stocked. They also have fresh cooked food and ice creams. Great experience, highly recommended. The only con will be the prices, but you need to have in mind that this are high quality products.; What can I say about this grocery store??

For my experience, it’s mainly the people mostly from New York who have a bit of arrogance, but other than that this is a great place to shop, and a great place to visit.; Fair prices (especially for the area), clean premises, friendly and helpful employees, and convenient location.

Like many stores some prices are high, but I go in knowing this and focus on customer service.

Mia was working at the salsa and salad counter. She greeted me right away, and answered all my questions. She offered me samples as they have a big variety.

I asked if they added sour cream to the guacamole as I do not like it. They don't. I bought cactus salad, and a few salsas. The only salsa that went bad fast is the Tatemada but the other's were fine. Mia got busy but not for long as Juan saw this and came over to help.

My next stop was the meat deli. I asked for a pound of carnitas. They are cheaper than the other two Mexican stores I've been to. The lady pointed out the sales. I appreciated it her doing so. All the meat looked fresh.

Next I headed to the bakery and noticed all the choices of breads, pastries and cakes. Lots of choices but not if you're a diabetic 😁

I walked the rest of store. If I lived here it would be my weekend store. Like any other store I would shop the sales and go to the next store.

A shout out to Mia and Juan for working as a team to take care of the customers. I saw how every customer that came to the counter got the same service I did.; Food is absolutely Overpriced & not tasty.. Their 'Super Burrito ' is more like a regular burrito. Carne asada is not seasoned well - salsa is also an extra charge . 'Super Tacos' are $5 Each on a regular white tortilla and not worth it to say the least.; Been here many times since moving to the area. From now on I'll go anywhere else but here. In all the years coming here it's always very inconsistent in quality and service. First, I've gotten produce that was rotten multiple times. I should have stopped going then. I have bought ready made food and gotten sick.    I stopped buying anything to eat here. I have bought tortillas with moldy ones in the middle. The last straw was today. Went to buy meat for a BBQ. Asked for marinated beef. I noticed the meat at bottom was in the marinade. I asked if he could give from bottom. He said the top is the same and anyway its way easier for me. The store was not busy and many of the guys in the meat area were standing around doing nothing. I would rather go somewhere else for everything and anything We need.; Very clean and organized with very nice staff. They have a great selection of items, although they can be a bit more pricey. The meat section and bakery have a variety of items. The cakes are a bit dry though.  I don't recommend the guacamole. It is the WORST thing you can eat! 2nd time in a row that we get Guacamole and it tasted spoiled. The agua fresca is okay.; Just come back from store. All my churros raw . Disappointed"

They are also clearly selling massive areas of shelf space to reduce competition and selection.  Just try to buy something other than grape or strawberry jelly.  Welches is the dominant brand, and Smuckers non-grape and non-strawberry are absent.  I expect eventually even these brands will be Krogerized as well.

Sad to see this happening as I used to love Fred Meyer.; Friendly service tonight even tho it was almost closing time.  One set of sliding entry doors was locked at 9pm, and I wanted to purchase an item right outside the locked doors.  so an employee went and got it for me, so I didn't have to carry the heavy items outside all the way to the next set of doors late at night.  Thank you! I was happy with my experience tonight.  Great job to the folks working at checkout; Freddys has changed in the last few years. I've seen sell items not showing sale at checkout.  Thought it was just someone's mistake but my last experience may stop me from shopping there again. Every item didn't show sell. Clerk was rude about it. The sell item tag was for another item but placed in front of wrong item. Seems like Freddys is trying to scam their customers. Now to top things off, security checks me at the door going out. Treating paying customers like criminals and letting the criminals walk out while the security beeper is going and not doing anything.  I'm going to shop at another store and maybe try Freddys again someday.; Not only are the lines longer due to reduced staff, but now you have to wait in another line to get out the door so the security guy can check your receipt (also due to reduced staff). I'd pay more for groceries to not have to deal with this."

I especially love their 18-year old balsamic, but also keep on hand their Pear-cranberry balsamic, Sicilian lemon balsamic and white balsamic. They have so many more options, too, as well as the makings for some wonderful meals.; Great service, helpful staff, they let you taste things, and the selection is wonderful.  Don't skip the cabinets of jams and jellies because there is so much more to buy.  (Bacon pepper jam....  mmmm); I walked in The Olive Grove store to propose a mural. I heard about the store from a friend and I was curious. Natalie was so kind and she knows all about olives. I am from Turkey and I still spend summers at Eagen Sea facing Greek Islands. In other words, one of the best olive reagens in the world. I also lived in Italy for 4 years and in Spain for 2 years. I have to admit that I got surprised when I started tasting the oils at The Olive Grove. I had to buy The Tuscan Herb Evoo. I make myself a Mediterranean breakfast salad every morning; tomatoes, cilantro, parsley, olives, feta cheese and lots of olive oil. When I tried my salad with my new Olive oil from The Olive Grove I was amazed! I feel so lucky to have this store in Mn.
Thank you Natalie🌸; Just made my first purchase a few days ago based on Anne's recommendations (she is amazing!) and extremely helpful flavor and pairing descriptions on the site.  I can't express enough how impressed I am with the quality of the oils and balsamic vinegars.  I cannot pick one favorite because all the flavors I purchased are divine!   I'll definitely be back!; I started using The Olive Grove's olive oils and balsamic vinegars last summer. What a difference they have made in our families meals!  Previously, I had thought I was buying ""the good stuff"" from the grocery store, but this has opened a whole new world of freshness and flavor! I LOVE that you can taste everything before buying it, so you'll never go home wondering if you're going to like something or not. The staff are very welcoming, friendly, and knowledgeable. They have lots of great suggestions for how to use the products. I've made many of the recipes found on their website, and they have all been delicious! Their products make wonderful gifts as well. Last Christmas I gave a gift bag to each of my children's teachers, which included a balsamic, an oil, a seasoning, and a recipe using the products. The teachers loved them! I would highly recommend The Olive Grove!"

It is always clean and items are easy to find.  The cashiers are friendly and usually greet customers at check out.; I don't like their new way of doing coupons! They are treated like rebates, which mean you pay the full price then the amount of the coupon is supposed to show ""in a few DAYS"" in your ""wallet"" section in their app. I have been waiting a week and my $3.00 rebate for buying a roast never came through!!! I hate this new system! I liked it when we just entered in our phone numbers and coupons actually saved money. HATE this ""rebate"" system. Feels scammy.; Store in Vidalia is ridiculous,  they do not honor the sale paper adds, for example, the sale paper has 3 dollars off one pack of hamburger meat. I was told that if it is not in the digital coupons then it is no good. I tried to talk to the manager but all she would tell me is that ""I just work here"". So be aware,  just because it is in the sale paper doesn't mean that it is on sale. Glad we have a Walmart!!

Had to change my review,  I messaged Vidalia Market about the sale paper and they corrected the problem.  The Digital Coupons has been updated and the correct 3 dollars off coupon for Ground beef now available but still kinda aggravating because the manager at the store had a I don't want to deal with you attitude and could have corrected this herself but someone did take care of the problem.; Great store. Well stocked and very clean. The employees were very friendly and helpful; I like this store when I'm visiting family because it's very clean and I can usually find what I'm looking for, some of the staff however, leave a lot to be desired with their customer service skills."

Cooked it as soon as we came home, well done until crispy. My entire family has been sick for days. Completely disgusted. First time coming in, now I’m never shopping here again.; This is probably the best store ever it's quick convenient and is delicious! Thank you guys for being so kind every single time I'll see you guys next time; I have craving menudo for quite some time.. I finally was able to get to this place to try  it out.. there meat selection is awesome.( just looked didn't buy) I did get some bfast chorizo and some tortillas will let you know how that is.. back to the Menudo I don't know how but it was kinda greasy not sure if the pigs feet made it that way.. but it was still very tasty, good flavor!! Will go back..; Pan dulce is super fresh and tasty! Ordered a cake and customer service in the bakery section was outstanding. Happy to say that I was satisfied and pleased with my visit.

I returned four days later to pick up the cake and was surprised and highly disappointed with the outcome of my cake. Firstly, the writing on the cake was smeared, smudged, and illegible. The cake toppers were placed on top of the HB writing! I'm still scratching my head how the baker/cake decorator had no sense in doing this or was simply careless. Seems silly that the the cake toppers were not accounted for prior to writing on the cake. Secondly, the cake was not fresh (made the day before). Apparently, the customer is supposed to be informed at the time ordering that the baker only works on select days...that which was not mentioned.

It's a huge bummer that this happened, but on the upside, I was glad that the cashier and the manager/owner accepted accountability for their error and did what they could to rectify the problem.

All in all, I will have to find another bakery for cakes, but may return for pan dulce if I'm ever in the neighborhood.; Great place for Fajitas de pollo!!! Can't be beat. Also grabbed some salsa roja and guacamole....good prices as well...never disappointa!"

They have a decent selection of Mexican goods, but that's probably the only reason I'd return. If you aren't a Spanish speaker, the deli counter is a bit intimidating. I heard many good things about their salsa, but it's just okay in my opinion. It also looked like they had four varieties behind the counter, but there were only two choices on the menu they have posted. I didn't receive what I thought I was ordering. There were some communication issues between me and the person helping me, who was also very softspoken, so it was confusing for me to order, even after asking for clarification. There is also the added pressure that so many people are in line, so I didn't want to take up too much time ordering. I was very disappointed in the pork as well. I took it straight home to refrigerate for later, still all wrapped up. When I opened it (same day), most of the pieces are completely dry with no flavor! For $8.99/lb, I couldn't believe the lack of quality. It seems as though lack of quality are what some others have posted in their reviews in the last year as well. I'm going to have to throw it away because I'm not sure it can be salvaged. I also purchased a bag of their tortilla chips, but they are stale. The package states they are packaged at Jacobos, but there are no dates, so not sure how fresh they are. I don't know if I just went on an off day or something, but I probably won't go here again aside from getting some of the Mexican candies/drinks. They have a huge selection of Jarritos and a nice (decently priced) selection of Mexican candies. They also have a good sized parking lot, so that was nice. The employees were friendly. As others stated, the store is cash only. At the time of writing, they have an ATM in store.; Jacobo's might be the perfect, South Omaha, large-scale Bodega.  It has a wide variety of products and a reasonable supply on-hand of each.  The piñatas and Mexican imports definitely lend it a certain Latin authenticity, but it's the deli at the back that is the cherry on this fried ice cream sundae.    We were on the hunt for some variety packs of bottled soda, but the steady stream of patrons for the quart-sized salsa containers told us we will need to make return trip!; All the Food and bakery items are Delicious my favorite place to buy. The cost of item's are very affordable and is only cash only sales  no credit cards or checks.; Best chips and salsa, hands down. Always a line, goes decently quick. Bring cash. No cards accepted; Yes my name is paul I go to Jacob's because they make the best authentic Mexican food there chips and salsa is the best 👌 the employees are very very nice and workers are very good I'm very impressed 👌 I recommend Jacob's market to everyone I been in omaha sense 1997 and ever sense they open Jacob's great service great food overall great employees"

The first sentence was my original review but I'm updating it after my experience this past weekend. FF had a wonderful 3-day sale on catfish nuggets that started on May 23, and ended on May 25. On May 24th, after work I stopped by this store but wasn't surprised when I saw that they were out. I asked a person from the meat department if they expected to have more and I was told yes, but I should come back on Saturday morning. The store opened at 6am so I stopped in at 6:45am. There were still no catfish nuggets on display but a person from the deli told me that the meat department personnel usually won't come in until 7am or so. I left to go grab coffee and then returned at about 7:30am. The nuggets were still not out so I asked a female from the meat department when they would be put out. She did say that they were indeed in the store but they probably won't be put out until the manager comes in later. According to her, he would need to dig them out and that will take some time. She could not give me a timeframe but said I should be okay if I came back in the afternoon. She asked for my name and how many pounds I would like then said she would set some aside for me. It wasn't until I went to the FF on 144th and W Center St then learned of an experience that my best friend had earlier the same morning at the FF on Saddle Creek, that I realized how poor and lazy the service I was given at the 108th St FF. First at the 144th FF, same thing, there were no nuggets on display when I arrived HOWEVER, I asked an extremely nice man from the meat department when they would be put out and he said, well I can get some for you now. He asked me to wait for about 5 minutes while he go to the back to get them. He asked how many pounds I want then asked if it were ok if he put them in one package. It couldn't have been a better shopping experience. While there, I decided to get a couple of steaks, some brats, five loaves of bread, and couple of other things. I spoke to my best friend who visited the Saddle Creek store on the same morning and he said when he arrived the nuggets hadn't yet been brought out but he asked a young kid where they were and the young clerk said to him, let me go and package some for you. Contrast those experiences to the lazy meat department clerk at 108th St who tried to make me think that the nuggets would need to be dug out by the manager as if they were brought to the store in a dumpster. Nevertheless, I did not go back and likely won't. The 144th St store appears to value customers more and from this point will get my business.; Best fried chicken in Omaha, don't believe me, go there and wait an hour in line, ridiculous, but so worth it. When they say they are not taking orders until a week out, there is a reason. I wish it wasn't so well known, selfishly. Freakin amazing, and great staff at the deli.; This Family Fare carries a few brands that I can't find at other grocery stores. Great deli, great produce. Everybody is always professional, helpful and friendly.
It's the only grocery/hardware store combo I've ever seen but it's pretty handy when you need furnace filters or something like that.; Went inside searching for a solution to a yard issue. Headed to the ACE area and everyone was busy. However, I found the Inventory team very busy. One young lady asked if I needed any help? She pointed me in the direction to get someone who could answer my question. I waited for a few minutes as the sales staff was busy with some keys. Waited a little while longer and turned to go to another store. I was stopped by a second female on the inventory team who was determined in a professional way to solve my issue. I explained to her that I really appreciated her assistance, but I'll try another store. To the two ""Ladies"" who were very helpful ""Thank You"". To the Inventory Team, collectively, your team was focused and professional. Keep up The Good Work !; Nice clean store, quiet. Lots of good stuff, will definitely go back. Check out was fast and easy."

I’m always impressed with the employees and how friendly they are.  I ordered something from the butcher and he had it cut up and back to me in about 5 minutes.  I noticed the owner who was greeting employees and customers alike with a friendly good morning.  He was all over the store, helping wherever needed.  When I took out my groceries, he was outside retrieving carts.  I told him how much I liked the store and how it was nice to see a store that was adequately staffed with happy employees.  I feel like Nichols really cares about customer service. 😊; If you want quality produce, it is all here! I personally enjoy shopping to locale stores. I will definitely keep coming back even thought it’s quite a drive, it’s worth it.; Just leaving the store, I’m sad to say after 43 years of business, I won’t be returning. Mike Hennigan, the worst thing you could have done was install self checkouts. That made your staff lazy and your customer service poor. The last time I was sick with RSV and had to get emergency groceries. I was told to cash my full cart of groceries out myself, while your cashiers stood around and talked. Today, I went to the “CUSTOMER SERVICE” desk at 8pm and was told she was closed and I’d have to cash myself out. I handed her my items and will take my business elsewhere from now on. My father is 97 years old and I can’t imagine him cashing himself out with a cart full of groceries. I quit working there when I was 17 and I don’t need to play cashier again. How unfortunate!; I live in SE Onondaga County but always travel to Nichols for meats, deli items, seafood, and other needs. Their meats are far & away better than Tops, Wegmans, Price Chopper, etc. the employees are always friendly & courteous.

You hardly ever see the same person helping you. They go through so many people. It was bad before the owner retired and gave it to his grandson, but now it is worse. There is a cook that sweats profusely that occasionally now works the front register. Who wants to see a cook come out of the kitchen dripping sweat.

You still can't get chicken fried for supper unless you have it fried before around 2:30 pm. or so. Who wants chicken that has been fried for around 3 hours before you eat it.

The workers used to know what customers wanted before they even walked through the door, but now they go through the employees so fast that no one gets to know the customers' wants or needs. The only good thing that I can tell that has happened is there is no hollering and cussing going on from old employees and guests .

The quality of the pizzas has  gone down also. We ordered several pepperoni pizzas, and NONE of them had more than 15 out of the 25 pieces of pepperoni that they should have on them. The ""Lots of Meat"" pizzas have anything but lots of meat. They are almost bare like the pepperoni pizzas are. The store charges more than the recommended price but gives you way less than what you pay for.

I hope things settle down and get somewhat back to being a place where I can bring my family to eat and not have to worry about if they are  sweating in/on my food; Great place to work with great co-workers. Employers treat you like family and really care about their employees.  As in alot of businesses these days, there has been alot of changes in employees, but you have to weed out the bad to get to the good. Staff is friendly and will go the extra mile to make sure customers are happy. Breakfast is now served all day along with the regular menu.

I have changed my mind on the place. Shopping there has always been an experience, but now I am done with this place.
Baiz, you have lost a good customer.
I spent easily between $50 and $100 there every time I went shopping at Baiz.
No more. For a $5 purchase, due to NO RETURN. The jar of pickled turnips had lost its seal. This store does not stand behind its products.
I say, no thanks. I can buy these products elsewhere.
BAIZ takes no returns even with a receipt, I do not return, ever.
I’m only out $5, other customers lost a lot more money. 💰; I like their meat (especially the lamb meat) and I shop some of my cultural food from here. Different varieties!
It is also worth mentioning what happened to me few months ago, I dropped my wallet with ID card and credit cards at their parking lot. Someone (not sure who that person is, could be customer or employee) hand it over to the manager.
That parking lot looks sketchy but thankfully I got my wallet after driving home and coming back several hours later. Great people! Appreciate them- this comment is for Phoenix location; Today I was shopping at the store and I wanted some pomegranates and I picked up a couple pieces and I came back home and I was like let me try one of them. It was black and burned. It was broken. I don’t know what to say and it was too expensive for a couple of pieces I wish they could please make sure everything comes fresh because this is not fresh. This is basically for trash and I am mad that I wasted eight bucks on just three pieces of Pomegranatesoverall, I give the store a 10 out of 10 because he has every supplies you need in the country, but still a lot of stuff it’s expired."

Please don’t make people sick; Good prices but it's so slow.  15 people at one cashier at 650am. Then somebody finally comes to help and they take people from the END of the line!!! Some of us had been waiting 15 minutes because of a customer paying in $1s and doing several separate transactions for 2 full shopping carts. Tell the cashiers who open a new line to take from the next in line,  not the people who haven't even waited.

This market is in an older shopping center/strip mall in Chandler. There are a lot of little stores and a couple of restaurants. The parking lot is on the smaller side and is usually busy, especially in front of this store.

They have a really good Mexican bakery and deli area. When you walk into the store, the bakery will be on your left and the sweet rolls/pan dulces will be straight ahead. If you follow around in that direction, you will see the deli and where they make their tortillas. It can get busy, especially on the weekends so you need to pay attention to your place in line. You usually have to pay for everything separately in each area, so if you buy something in the bakery, you will pay there. If you buy something in the deli area you will pay at their register. If you buy groceries, meat, and packaged goods, you will need to pay at one of the main cashiers on your way out.

It is a small grocery store that carries mostly Hispanic products. You can get some good deals on tortillas, meat, and produce. You can see their weekly ad online or sign-up for their ad to be sent to your email.

I usually go for their deli items like carnitas, roasted/grilled chicken, and for their fresh tortillas. They are open from 6am-9pm every day except some major holidays.; This review is of my recent visit to their deli and bakery (last Saturday).  It was a late afternoon visit and their hot foods in the kitchen looked fresh and there was plenty to choose from.  I ordered the red menudo and it was flavorful, savory, and a little spicy. 👍👍The bakery also had a good variety of fresh goodies.; I don't know why I keep going back to this place. Today was my last visit as I will not put up with their rude conduct.
I visited the food counter and ordered some Menudo for take out. As the girl at the register is handling my order, I asked if I could have bread instead of tortillas and she said no, those are for the restaurant. I jokingly said, well that's not fair and she responded with, if you don't like it go somewhere else.
I was pretty disappointed with her response. I did not say another word as she just handed me my receipt and ignored me, not even a thank you.

I don't expect any special treatment but at least the courtesy of saying thank you come again would be nice, needless to say I will not return again. This is not the first bad experience I've had at this store.; The prices are too high. Quality is great. Portion is small and extremely overpriced. When visiting expect to spend no less than $50. Bakery appears fresh, meat is fresh and clean.; We made a preorder birthday cake for our Daughter and it came out so cute. They added details and made the cake Girly. We will order from them again."

The place was empty and the service was excellent and fast. The food, though, was just average, hence the 3 stars.

I got the midnight sandwich and the pastrami with cabbage. The pork on the midnight was clearly leftover and reheated, which I'm fine with, when reheated properly. They should put it in a pan with either cooking juices or mojo and make the pork juicy again. Instead it was very dry and not at all tender. Really a disappointment.

The pastrami was much better, but also very dry. It had cabbage and cheese and I think tomato, but no sauce. I'm glad they used cabbage instead of coleslaw but they needed to replace the sauce of the coleslaw with something else. Thousand island dressing would've been perfect, taking it from a 5 to an 8.

I must say their bakery goods looked fantastic. So keep in mind this review is only for the two sandwiches I ordered. Perhaps I didn't order well, but I did ask for everything on the sandwiches.

Love the almound cookies ❤️; Around noon on a Wednesday, we tried about 5 other places that said they were open in the area but were not when we arrived. But, we were very happy to end up here! Excellent sandwiches, perfect fresh French bread. We had the ricomni special & the Cuban. Highly recommend both. Before we got our sandwiches we had a cinnamon roll that was warmed up for us, one of the best we've ever had. Staff was friendly, helpful, and spoke some English.; Best fresh bread, awesome coffee and friendly staff all make this place worth visiting. Not to mention, the tasty variety of pasties to choose from. I had a cinnamon roll. Swing by if you can.; My wife and I went two different times on our trip to PR. The staff were all very helpful, kind and patient. The food was absolutely phenomenal, very fresh and flavorful too. If I was able I would rate this place a 6/5 for the experience, service, and great food!

Keep it up guys!"

They are the one's who take care of the active military,and veterans and our elders the right way at anytime,You can be overseas or in any 50 states and still place orders and know your groceries will be delivered in the most proper manner. And best of all their workers take the groceries inside your home so clients won't have to worry about having a hassle. Very much APPRECIATED.; We found everything we wanted. The prices seemed fair & many different brands to choose from. Store was clean & people were friendly & polite. Glad I went here instead of Walmart.; So far, Super Max of Puerto Rico has all of the boars Head  products if anyone is interested in this type of cold cut. Just go to the dely department and place your order and they also make sandwiches and serve foods that are the special of the day. Parking is for everyone. There are wheelchair ramps, parking and wheelchair accessible entrance, and bathrooms for both males and females. This establishment is Parr of a shopping center that includes other stores and restaurants; I love that superMax is close to my mom's house because when I visit I can still find products I get at my home.  They have an impressive selection of products including premade salads, ethnic desserts and local products.  The staff is very friendly and helpful."

They are close to the freeway and have a good seafood selection.  I have to give them 1 star for a bad experience.  After paying at the register and just 10 feet away from the counter and nowhere near the exit door, I heard a ""Hey you! I need to check your receipt.""  Turns out, it was the security guard yelling at me from 20-30 feet away.  He checked my receipt, and everything was good and let me go.  I felt the security guard was very rude for yelling out from that far away to check my receipt.  And he only checked my receipt and no one else.  Other grocery stores have a receipt checker at the door that checks everybody's purchase, and that's OK.  Shun Fat Westminster managers need to figure out better ways to make their customers feel valued and not treat them like thieves for simply buying seafood.; This market is huge! Really great selection of Asian groceries and produce. The store is very clean and also has a sushi stall as well as boba stand. Prices are fair and parking is very easy. I much prefer coming here as it’s less crowded than many of the other Asian grocery stores.; Very beautiful interior design, the seafood sections is large and they have a a large selection of fish to choose from!

The noodles didn't have expiration dates on them. I thought they should be ok but within 2 days when I wanted to use them, they were moldy. I opened one and smelled mold and quickly checked the other pack and found the same thing.
The box of rambutans was $30. The top layer was filled with red fresh rambutans.  Upon opening the saran wrap, I found the bottom layers were black, moldy and rotten. I only ate about 7 good ones on the top. What a scam!
Upon calling the store and asking for a refund they said that fresh food doesn't come with guarantees. So they can continue to sell rotting food to unsuspecting customers and it's perfectly fine!!! What BS!!; Dont come here even if its for one item. Everything is expired or going bad. Place is dirty and stinks. Rude ass cashiers need to learn some manners and not slam my stuff or have an attitude problem.; We're so lucky to have such a great Asian food store!

I recommend if you need to buy something quick.; Every time I go to this place I have a very bad experience. My last visit I purchased a gallon of mill that had good expiration day but when I used it, it was bad, I was making jello and waist 4 package of it. When I try to get reimbursed they told me that they couldn't help me or reimburse my money. They're not very good with costumer service.; The music is sooo loud!!  The only reason I shop here,  is because my mom likes the fruit. Why the 2 stars....the cashiers are friendly.; I love this grocery store.  It's no frills with fantastic quality and prices on produce and is a great source for a variety of Mexican ingredients (cheeses, meats, crema, dried peppers, ect.)  The red and green sauces they sell here are DELICIOUS (if you like heat I should mention) and I always have at least one in my refrigerator because I use them so often and they pair well with so much.  They also have a great inexpensive eatery and fresh fruit/ juice stand, but be prepared for long lines because every time I come here they seem very  popular."

Complained to store manager and they said next time bring the knife check before purchase.... This place is joke.; Love the freshness and verity of produce . The prices are reasonable. I also love the ready prepared hot food. I am not korean, and i don't know how to cook Korea food. The ready prepared food gives me a chance to explore and try new delicious korean dishes.
I love the food samples that they give out. Also, the sample ladies are usually very kind. They help me in getting to know the products.  They give me recommendations on what to buy and what ingredients are needed to make some simple dishes.
I also appreciate the kitchen tools and utensils section.  It always have good quality reasonably prices products.
Also the little restaurants and shops inside the supermarket building.  This is a good place to grab a quick launch.  Or even grab prepared food and take it home to enjoy it.; Standard Korean market in Buena Park. Has just about everything you might be looking for when it comes to Korean food. Fruits and vegetables are good and fresh. There's a fish market with two or three Korean guys who seem to hate being there but are good about cleaning fish when asked. There's also a bakery and food court inside,  but I've never visited those areas. Not as modern looking as the HMart across the street, but it's a little bit cheaper for the same products. Some of the aisles are too narrow. Also, this place can get really busy on the weekends in the afternoon. There are a lot of parking spots.; I often bought mackerel from H Mart because it was good and cheap…

After purchasing 4, the price difference is almost double…

4 mackerels and a pair of sardines for $18.55. At the H Mart next door, 5 mackerels (free cleaning) for $12… .

The cost of cleaning fish should also be realistically very cheap... Is this how the service at large marts should be?

Why is the cost of fish preparation so expensive? Then customers will stop coming.

Isn't that too much?!

Everything else here is good, but the seafood section is too expensive.

It's convenient because there are all Korean food and ingredients, and it seems that a lot of foreign friends are coming these days.All sales prices have risen, so even if you buy a little, $100-2/300 is the basic. Koreans who go here should keep their conscience. Even though there is a cart gathering place, they should leave it anywhere and protect their national dignity.; Their CS is a total disappointment. Bought a box of cookie 2 days ago (imported from Korea, expire Dec 2024) and tasted totally stale and texture also off. I had this cookie 쿠크다스 since childhood and even bought few months ago without a problem, so I know how it tastes. Lady at CS claims no refund for an open item (I had one opened, tasted one out of 30 in the box). She said refund ok for food gone bad but this is not an applicable item lol. I do not know their definition of 'bad food' but clearly she was blaiming on my change in taste. I suggested they do QA for the current batch and the lady denied it since I was the first to bring up the issue with this item.  Poor reasoning overall and humiliating experience. They just lost their loyal customer of 4 years over a small box of cookies."

Not happy every time I go the fruit is bad . All the cashiers don't greet you at all; Always very crowded, outside in the parking lot AND inside the store. Most times I've been there the lines are super long (especially on Wednesdays) and they usually only have like 2 cashiers, one being an express lane. The cashiers are sometimes rude - YOU greet them and they either ignore you or respond all dry.

I was also harassed by their on-site ""security "" guard, JR, he followed me to my vehicle and proceeded to offer me outings that were not requested. In another occasion, I saw this same security guard (JR) and an older gentleman who was the cart attendant- being racist and aggressive. A woman who may have been Vietnamese asked the cart attendant if he could help her with her groceries and he said ""no because you no pay "" meaning she wasn't going to tip him (I assume). A bystander instead took it upon himself to help the woman load her groceries and when the cart attendant and JR the security saw the man (Hispanic) doing that they started talking bad to him to the point where JR implied he wanted to fight.

This store is all over the place with these outside and inside employees. I don't even think management does anything about it either since it's not the 1st time employees have been reported.; This grocery store was so clean and tidy. Fresh produce with great price."

This market has a lot going on and the produce options are pretty great I come here for fruit mostly and I will keep coming back as long as they keep them deals coming. The meat selection today was pretty great. If your buying a meat or something that was on the add I would recommend calling in advance. Always calm in advance if you trying to get alot of something. The price here is usually better then most places. Bulk food items are available here. I recommend stocking up on can food prices here . I think they are hiring right now too. They really just need to work on keeping the lines down or at least making sure they got the best on register.; The bakery! I was SOOOO impressed. This looked like a high end stand alone bakery... but located in a grocery store?! They put all other grocery store bakeries to shame!
The produce was incredibly fresh. This is a nice store.; Elma, Elmo, Alma whatever her name was in hot foods! Ridiculous customer service, doesn’t know any manners.

I would eat there though if given the opportunity. They also have a floral area.. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because I've shopped here previously and the lines can be long at times. Other wise nice store and nice prices on everything; Good great. But not as good as you people are at keeping track of where I go.
Is it me that's tagged. Hopefully it's the phone.
Do you also know when I'm sitting down on the toilet
Hope not I'm bashful .
Are our life's always in danger of exposure for going to  bad places like a Bar.
Do we get thumbs up for going to church."

The interior is a little dirty and some items aren’t very well stocked. I also got the feeling that the workers there are grumpy and not willing to help. I guess the only thing superior about this market are the prices, otherewise I don’t think I’ll come back.; You can buy the freshest vegetables here. I love the bakery department. The staff are always friendly. The store is always orderly the floor is always clean and there's always a fast check out. Don't forget to download the superior app to get discounts and loyalty points!; Pretty much a grocery store but with a lot of different mexican bakery goods.; I'm impressed by how far along some of these stores have come.  I'm glad I've given them another chance.  A few years back, the whole experience was usually negative, but I must say they are definitely being managed much better now in days. A couple more cashiers open during peek hrs would be great. (Around the time the kids are leaving school); I find that Superior Grocers are far more friendly and helpful than their competitors, right across the street El Super. Thank you for the great products and customer service."

I'm probably not going to ever go back to this Walmart again it was just a one-time thing cuz I needed a few things and it was the closest Walmart near by. but it's not a bad store.; This specific Walmart neighborhood market in La Puente is very close to me and that’s what makes it convenient for me and my family. Always has what we need and the employees on the floor and standing by the self-checkout are always helpful and nice. I’m not going to stop going here. But tell me why every time I’m by the vitamins/medicine isle, I can hear employees cussing and being super loud, by where I assume is their break room? It’s usually young guys. It’s super uncomfortable especially when I’m with my kids. I was going to complain to a woman employee once but I was embarrassed to sound like a Karen or just an older person complaining about kids; but also I was embarrassed for her like these are her co- workers. I love this convenient place to go and get last minute dinner items but I just wish it was a more comfortable experience.; I had an exceptional experience at Walmart thanks to Cid! I was looking for a chicken tenderizer hammer, but couldn't find any on the shelves. Cid stepped in and went above and beyond to help me out. He checked his device and discovered that there was a shipment of the product. Without hesitation, he went to the back, unboxed the item, and brought it out for me. His willingness to assist and dedication to customer satisfaction truly impressed me. I'm grateful for his outstanding service and couldn't be happier with my shopping experience. Thank you, Cid, for your exceptional service!; I always come here because its convenient and is small enough to find the items I need unlike the large super centers. Quick in and out. Good selection; MADI is always a bright spot during my La Puente store visits. Even when things are stressful in the store, you can count on her to not show it.

Always located at the front entrance where she can easily be seen; Madi can be found front and center, easily accessible to answer any questions or just to keep the flow of pedestrian traffic moving and the bad guys away.

She's exceptionally good at what she does and she knows the store like the back of her hand. Pleasant and welcoming, yet forthright in taking care of the necessary business.

She's a true example of what it looks like to do a job well and treat people with decency and respect while doing it.

Way to go Walmart for having her as part of your team!!!"

It's not a supermarket by any stretch of the imagination. In reality, it's more of a mini mart. They have as much variety as you can have in a place this size. Think: Pueblito.
Update: They are renovating by increasing the space by probably 50%. Let's see what happens.; Loved this supermarket, I wish we had one like this in Moca. I couldn't believe they had Boar's Head deli products. Reminded me of the delis in nyc . Great assortment of everything.; Too cramped. Isles are too small. Selection is smaller than regular pueblo.; Honestly speaking, I did find some products I was looking for and good prices, but Pueblo also lack on some other products that I was not able to find there. It really needs a variety of certain things that way one can do their whole groceries in one place and not have to go elsewhere. I also want to point out that there was another customer complaining about the same issue. Overall I am pleased with what I was able to get. Thank you for your services."

The manager frequently closes the store 2-3 hours before the posted time. Very inconvenient not to mention that parking is a nightmare. It’s difficult even just to drive by the store because of all the shoppers out in the middle of the road. It’s very small and not very well maintained.; Terrible management. I Arrived at 8:20 pm and at 8:40 pm they were turning the lights off and waiting for me at the cash register.  Closing time is at 9:00 pm.  In any normal supermarket they wait for you until you are finished purchasing your groceries.  Since it was dark, I stop collecting things and went straight for the cash register.  At the cash register I paid for everything I got.  I paid for the food with the food assistance money (food stamps).  Then I paid 6.35 for beer with a debit card.  The lady at the cash register tried to charge me for the beer again, because they are not supposed to put beer and food on the same purchase ticket.  The cash register terminal separates food, from anything else that is not food automatically.  I asked the lady why was she charging me for the beer twice? She answered me, that I had not paid for it it yet.  I asked her, then why did I pay you 6.35 right now?  She very unfriendly told me, that she did not know, that I have to look it up in the ticket that she gave me.  I looked it up, and in fact she had already charge me for the beer when I payed with the debit card.  Even showing her, she denied doing that and wanted to charge me for the beer separately in another ticket, thus making me pay for it twice.  Another employee had to come and confirm that in fact she charged me for the beer.  To finish with the story, the employees were very unfriendly, except for the man that show me to the rest room, everybody else were unprofessional.  They rounded up around me like if I was a thief, and they were just in a rush to get out of there.  They did close exactly at 9:00pm after chasing me out the door, not having the least consideration for doing business with me.  If you have a choice, do not go there.  Econo Aguada is probably the last supermarket that you want to go.  Any other supermarket, Selectos for example, will give you better customer service.; A lot of supermarket options to buy at a nice price.

It has something for everyone with their little individual shops. They have from handicraft articles to a food restaurant.
Prices on these little shops were ok, customer service was good too. Only thing was that there is not a complete grocery store, this area was pretty small.One thing that we experienced was that when we asked for help about finding an item the young lady ignored us and kept walking away, I walked behind her for mostly a whole aisle calling for her attention and she never turned around.  I just hope their customer service gets better.; I absolutely ""LOVE"" this ""GEM"" of a market! It is like visiting a little Mexican town at my beloved Mexico! You will find all sorts of authentic breads, gello, fruits, and other goodies! The authentic Mexican dishes are so tasty! They have live music every Sunday as well. Bring the whole family, and you will enjoy every minute. I wish we had a market such as this one closer to home. The drive it definitely worth it! Huntington Beach is only a few minutes away.💗; I was visiting relatives and they decided to take me here, foodie that I am. Lol.  This place was phenomenal!! The food the fresh vegetables and fruits. Fresh guacamole! To die for!! Don't even get me started on the Pastries they have. If I lived here, I would do my grocery shopping here at least once a week and be showing up for lunch or dinner more often than that. Great atmosphere and friendly staff.; Absolutely stunning and authentic Mexican-American market in the heart of Costa Mesa! You can find absolutely anything here, especially your favorite Mexican staples and any ingredient you can imagine to make your favorite Mexican cuisine. The restaurants are incredible and the staff unbelievably accommodating. Not to be missed!; This is our first time at this market. A couple of golf buddies were raving about it, and now I see why. It's amazing—so many places to eat, drink, and shop, plus a great Mexican restaurant. We'll definitely be back often."

Can you imagine! Her name was Lida and She was MANAGER!
I told her I can pay extra for container
She said NO!!!
Two other ladies who work in here are very professional and nice but manager is horrible!!!
She needs to be trained to know a basic customer service.; I stopped by this grocery store on a whim. Couldn't find the steaks I wanted but when I went to the deli the butcher recommended these rib eyes for a grill outside. They were phenomenal! These four steaks for about $90 but they were probably the best meal I've had in quite a while My friends and I enjoyed a great meal thank you!"

Thank You & ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐'s; 2600 Victory...Frustration personified. 10:30 am on a Saturday 8/17/24 and only two checkouts open. Had to wait at least ten minutes in line...couldn't use self-checkout since I needed change. Was over-charged on a sale item and when I asked for a manager to correct it she had just come in and told me to wait while she clocked in. Imagine...no manager until 10:45am. Then she told me that I had to go to a cashier for as refund...I was not going to go through that ordeal again. Fortunately one of the baggers was standing close by and opened a register for me. His name is Eddie and he was the only one that showed any concerns. He was bagging, explaining things and helping a person in front of me who was a tourist, showed me where the  manager should be, and, as said, opened a register to correct the price, applying a credit on my card.
Someone from corporate should come up on a Saturday and make sure there is a manager on duty, have enough checkouts open, and find out why they wait until busy times to start re-stocking shelves, thereby blocking the aisles.; Edit: This store is no longer listed here correctly, maybe because it gets so many bad reviews (?). It's called home and the address is not correct. The Ralph's is at 2500 W. Victory Blvd. It's not at the current listed address. I'm not sure why this particular Ralph's attracts so many homeless and transient people. But it does. Seems much worse since Covid. Yesterday, while I was scanning my items at self-checkout, a very homeless looking woman at the next scanner asked me for money. Ralph's, why is this store so completely messed up? Do you want to respond to this review and explain that to us?

Older review: The prices on many items are out of control. They want $4.50 for 6 Kaiser rolls that used to cost $3. A small sour dough bolle is $6. I could go on and on with what I saw today. It’s now cheaper to shop at Whole Foods. The Kroger corporation is pillaging the public. It’s a disgrace, really. We customers, who made this company a success, are being thanked this way. On top of that, they are getting rid of more workers. They have just added these fancy new check out systems with conveyors. You scan your item, put them on the belt and they go to the bagging end. You pay and then you move down to bag your items. While you’re doing so, the person behind you begins to scan theirs and their items come and mix with yours while you’re trying to bag them. It’s the dumbest invention I’ve ever seen. The US airlines managed to make flying a really horrible annoying experience. I didn’t think a supermarket could pull that off. I guess I was wrong. It’s really sad because I’ve shopped at this supermarket for many many years. Not anymore.; In my 60 years of living I've seen grocery stores give deals for customers just for walking in their door. It used to be that stores thought All customers that take the time to drive to their store and walk in the door should be considered a valued customer.  Then stores decided to make us give them our addresses and emails to get those deals. We now had to start using their card to receive deals, no more valued customers unless you give up your mailing addresses. Fine, we did that. NOW you can't just show your Ralph's card or just be a customer walking in the door. Ralph's now advertises deals stating...digital CARD. The word digital is much smaller than the word CARD giving customers that didn't bring their glasses and/or didn't see the smaller word ""digital"" the impression they can use their Ralph's card for the deal. I mean, it's not even a Card so why is it advertised as a digital CARD?!?! To Trick Us! Why can't I get these deals with my Ralph's card like we used to? This just makes the CARD obsolete. Probably why they don't have them any more. This type of advertising affects mainly the elderly who need glasses to see that tiny lettering, it's hard to see on purpose, just rushing though the store can cause one to not notice the word digital. it's such a crappy trick that billion dollar corporations pull all the time on everyone especially the elderly! The elderly don't always have the transportation to return those items. Not everyone has space on their phone or even has a phone to download apps. Not everyone has a computer or iPhone and are able to easily go online to join Ralph's website and scroll through coupons. Even if Ralph's advertising was readable why are these grocery stores making their customers waste OUR valuable time by making US download an app? Or making us sign up online then making us scroll through coupons that we then have to download or something something in order to receive a savings while I'm already there shopping?! It's a complete waste of MY time. Aldi's, Trader Joes and Costco are so much better. I get the deals and I'm considered valued just for walking in the door. No jumping though hoops just for a simple deal. Trader Joe's, Aldi's and Costcos produce tastes so much better than Ralphs any way. So Ralphs, Stop tricking customers into paying 200% more for a product. Stop tricking them into paying that jacked up price. I'm returning my produce that should have cost me $10.00 but instead you charged me $30 dollars all because I didn't download a digital coupon of which I had no clue what that meant until I got home and had to research it. Because I have to waste my time returning this over priced produce I will never be returning to Ralphs. It's disgusting and should be criminal when big billion dollar corporations use deceitful advertising to get those billions. Especially when it's on the backs or should I say from the banks of the elderly and it affects them the most. If I could give negative stars I would. There's no reason but greed for the pillaging.; Burbank is having three Ralph..... I think this is the best in terms of huge stocks.....
Very nice and clean, well maintained.... stuffs are very friendly.....

Huge parking outside.... Star bucks and US bank counter is inside....

Plenty of stocks on Dairy , Meats, Bakery, Fruits,  Frozen sections, Vegetables,  liquors everything..

Most importantly wine section is excellent 😊😊"

Today, the young man who has been bagging groceries for my Wife, put the one Dozen Eggs...$3.99 not cheap, on top of Cart and upon exiting the Store, they fell and all broke.  Seen by Security Guard saw it...but after unpacking the Cart and returning to ask for a Replacement dozen, it all went bad.  Wife is from Hormigueros and NYC so she expected some customer service.  Nope, the Bagger boy took   eggs and receipt to MGR ON DUTY who said because it happened outside, she needs the Owners approval.  Mr. Velez...about 90 yrs old came to handle the situation.  He said something like nothing I can do because it happened outside store.  Wife said I know it happened outside store, but your Employee packed the Cart.  He was Adamant, not my problemo.  Wife explained, I just spent $173 plus and spend $800 a month here.  And he said something like...how do I know that you didn't drop them. I.e. my fault.  Wife asked...R u calling me a Liar?  Sir, don't you know I am the Customer and the Customer is always right? Owner says.. It's not like the Eggs are 5 cents, who is going to pay for them?  I have to Fire the kid now. Sir, I am on Social security and worked very hard for my money.  Now you are calling me a liar and a thief. I am a Child of God. Don't you have a damaged goods margin.  He said I don't need your business and you are no longer welcome here...So, after like 20 minutes wait, the gal came and gave a Dozen eggs.  I was very unpleasant and unprofessional, although we like the Grandkids who normally assist us, the old man is not in touch with reality.  They are losing about 9-10k in Sales a year over a bad customer service interaction.  Really sad... especially if he fires the bag boy.  Shop at your own Risk .. Caveat Emptor!!; Every shopping trip here is a great experience.  I am able to find what I need and the prices are really great. The kindness of the cashiers at checkout really make it 5 stars for me.; Best fresh meats. Fresh Churrascos...Good prices and variety.

It seems that every supermarket in Mayaguez is falling apart and not maintained correctly. It all comes down to management. This supermarket is notorious for rotten fruits and vegetables. And I have personally seen the workers stacking fruits on top of ripe/rotten fruits without bothering to remove the bad ones. Every single day they are stocking and have their pallets in the way. Makes it incredibly difficult to navigate and find what you're looking for. I only shop here cause it's the cheapest supermarket in the area. I gave it a one star because the cashiers are nice, they will smile and be polite and have nice conversations with you which makes the horrible shopping experience a little less painful. Do better.; Great for a PR supermarket chain. My preferred one. Second that.; Very clean and organized grocery store that had everything we needed.

When I do get to have a conversation,  they are very fun and friendly!
You can either get an horchata or jamaica premade cup at the register or on the left side of the store, you can choose the fruit you like and have a fresh water made right there while you wait for your food. It usually takes 30 mins for each order to be made since most are/have HANDMADE tortillas, sopes, huaraches, etc
If you are in a hurry for pick up, I suggest you order at least 20 mins ahead of time BUT don't take 30mins-1 hr to get there and expect to have hot food waiting for you
This is an AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD restaurant so come in with patience and enough time to wait for your food
You won't be disappointed if you come in with a positive attitude 😁; Food is always amazing it really helps if you calling your order if you're taking takeout The staff is always so nice and very respectful food does not disappoint always gives you that homemade feeling; Other times they put avocado on my quesadilla this time not very good only like a 🍒 of avocado; Wouldn't go there at all, I ordered a plate of chicken enchiladas and it took them like 40 minutes. The worst thing is there was no wait 🤦🏾; The chicken is so good from here! I highly recommend the chicken Huaraches or tacos. Very filling and the price isn't too bad. When they're busy it could seem like the workers are rude, but they're just trying to be efficient. Highly recommend."

And, the online website doesn't provide a link to update your personal info.  It was evident she didn't want to be working there, didn't want to help others.  She was just there to pretend to work while collecting government money doing the less possible & counting the hours to finish the day.  What a waste of public funds.  Hiring an incompetent employee while other capable and willing people can't work.  Such an inept!; Great place to purchase produce and goods. You can find the best bread you have ever tasted at the Bakery located here! I highly recommend buy bread there."

The meat was horrible, it looked like they gave me all the waste they took off the good meat. It was mostly fat and hard waste. It took me a few hours to separate the good meat from the bad. I called the store they denied me speaking to a manager. I was told that there was nothing they could do for me since the meat was already tampered with. She was very rude and asked me why I didn't check the meat before leaving the store. I said I did not know I had to check the meat, why would I? I am sorry but I paid good money for that meat, it was not given to me for free. I shouldn't have to check it to make sure it isn't trash.  I did not notice how bad the meat was until I was ready to cook it, I did not have time to drive back to the store.  I had to use it, serving my family and friends what I was able to clean from it.  I felt horrible and embarrassed to feed them waste, I don’t think that is fair.  The store caters to the Latino community and the Latino community deserves better than that, we work hard for our money and expect more from our grocery stores.  You need to hire staff that is less rude and that takes pride in the products they serve.  I will never buy from your store again and I will make sure to let all my friends and family know how horrible your meat is.; This is one of my favorite places to shop, especially when I’m making carne asada or ceviche. They have everything I need plus many other ingredients that are hard to find. The place is very clean and wide-open. Interestingly, knowing that they cater to a Hispanic audience, their prices are substantially more than almost all other supermarkets. The reason I don’t give them five stars is because of their customer service. The staff in the aisles are friendly and will help you, but the staff at the registers frequently are rude. The last four visits have been especially awful, given how I am treated at the register. The girls seem irritated with customers and do not smile. They are typically visiting with each other, so a customer interruption rocks their world.; My family and I like to shop here because of the selection. We are from out of town but might come here one or two times a month. While looking at some of the reviews I notice other people had issues with customer service too. We went to the meat counter early on a Saturday morning and they were not busy like they usually are, about four people ahead of us, six standing around the whole thing. We took a number and waited about five minutes. My wife asked for three pounds of the same cut of meat but wanted it separated into three separate bags of one pound each, not an unreasonable request, because we were going to give the other two pounds to two other people and keep one for ourselves. Well, the young guy and this woman, both are new since the last time we were there, both immediately started having fits and making visible childish pouting faces with my wife's request.

My wife didn't act rude and was nice to them while asking but they didn't want to do the extra work and had a counter request of, well can we just do two bags instead of three? No we want three. ""Well they get mad at us for taking to long""....Who is they and to long for what??? There was no crowd and usually we get one person helping not two so it should go even quicker right? So    they did what we requested while making faces at each other like children not wanting to do something they are told to do, and they asked if there was anything else we needed? My wife replied, in a rude way this time, No! It'll will be to much work for you...
I suggested we complain to the manager but she said, ""no why..next time we come here they won't be here"".; I stopped here to get donuts for my son's club meeting.  They DO NOT have donuts.  But what they do have was very unique and well received by the team.  I took pictures of many of the pastries and what I think of as Mexican style cookies.  The baked goods are not as sweet as you would find in USA grocery stores so this is great for those looking to cut down on their sugar intake.  The pastries with the cream cheese topping are DEVINE!  I was so tickled as how much the kids loved them.

This is a great cultural experience.  The produce is huge and fresh.  There are sections of Mexican candies and everyday kitchen items that are unique from Mexico.

The meat counter is enormous! I've never seen such a large variety of meat to choose from.  The sea food looks so fresh you could swear they were just caught.

At the entrance inside are a lot of Crain games to occupy bored children.  A very teensy tine florist area is right by there and they offer some very decent flower bouquet.

There is a restaurant here that offers sit down tables.  All in all this was a very fun place to shop.  There is also a very large handicap parking that takes up the center of the parking lot. The doors are automatics so this place is very handicap friendly.; Went today for the first time here in Arizona. I grabbed a pre-packaged chicken and it smell rotten.  Obviously I walked.out the door and never coming back. I should of never turned my back on walmart.  I give 1 star because I have to rate otherwise I would give -stars......"

The store manager is a joke to hire staff that is so careless and rude. And why does every cashier assume you don't speak English and just come out and speak Spanish? Cashier's have given my wife a bad attitude because she does not speak Spanish but because of her appearance it's automatically assumed by all you low level employees. This location needs a complete revamp and honestly it starts from management. The bakery make wait while there right in front you casually carrying on with a personal conversation and when interrupted immediately resort to let you know you're a bother. Also have issues in the meat department and that was enough for me to completely eliminate your business for good. I post this to warn other customers of what to expect when you visit Vallarta Markets It's very disappointing.; I love the butcher department ""carniceria"" is great. Fresh meats and seafood.

We shop here weekly and know most of the staff. The produce is less expensive than anywhere else, with a good selection of meats and European cold cuts.
A week ago, on a Saturday evening, I purchased salmon steaks and planned to cook them within the next two days. When it came time to cook, we discovered the salmon was putrid and smelled terrible. The stench was so bad that we had to dispose of the bag with the deli label, even though I wanted to keep it to report the issue.
We went to the store to inform the manager about the situation. The manager informed us that the policy is to return an unsatisfactory item within 24 hours with a receipt. Unfortunately, we had neither because I typically don't keep grocery receipts. While the cost of the meat was not the issue, the manager's lack of concern for our 20+ years of loyalty was very upsetting.
We will now shop somewhere that values its customers.; The best place for all types of European food and delicacies. The staff are all so very helpful and everyone seems to speak 27 languages. I got sauerkraut imported from Poland there. They make fresh Sangak Bread daily. The produce is so fresh and well priced. Love this place!🏆; This place is very unsanitary. I went to the bakery, someone ahead of me was being served. The employee used her very sticky hand to get different pieces of pastries without gloves or using tongs or a spatula and put them in a container for him. He left without taking the container. It was my turn now, she never cleaned her hands, she never wore gloves, she used a dirty towel on the counter to wipe the stickiness from her hand and started taking the pastries I wanted with her dirty hand and putting them in a container. I too left without taking the pastries. As I am posting this, I see that someone left a 1-star review a couple of days ago, Nazanin T, said the pastry she bought from this place had a hair in it. She posted a picture of the pastry and the hair. After seeing them in action, I can understand why there was hair in her pastry.  From there I moved to the deli section to get some cold-cut meat. I saw two people behind the counter and assumed they were both employees. It turned out the guy was an employee and the lady was his girlfriend who was allowed back there touching every single meat and cheese and helping herself. I asked a question and he told me to wait a minute. He spent 15 minutes with her as she was helping herself to the slicer, the cutter, and the packaging papers without any gloves. She and he then filled up her shopping cart that she had taken behind the counter and filled it with meat and cheese and she left. After waiting 15 minutes I left because I did not want to buy anything from this deli anymore. I went to the produce department which is 2 feet away from the deli section. After he finished with his girlfriend, he never asked if he could help me. He could see me as I could see him. He had no one to serve as everybody got disgusted and left but he never offered help. I will not go back to this place. Very disappointing and unsanitary.; I had a bad experience recenlty. The produce i bought was bad, and this manager guy got very aggressive trying to tell me there was nothing wrong. It was rotten. He was way over the top and i havent been back since. I have such mixed feelings about this place, as I like the fresh bakes and the overall options.; Parry the manger with the brown hair and glasses supper rude women I bought a teapot and it was missing the top part and she was basically accusing me if my parents should’ve have checked, and I was the only one who bought it and was the only one in the store I feel like because I look young she accused me. Marey the Hispanic women in the front with curly hair super helpful and did a great job . Maybe make her the manger not the other lady who asked me why ur parents didn’t check the item when I was the only one there"

I was very upset to find out that when I ordered custard filling in my granddaughter‘s birthday cake it was not custard. Superior market uses a vanilla flavored whip cream and tells their customers that it’s custard. That is FALSE ADVERTISING! They are charging you for something that you are not getting.
For those who don’t know what custard is… It’s kind of like a thick vanilla pudding. NOT VANILLA WHIP CREAM.
And then I don’t know who did it but one of them people back there stuck their finger or something in the cake, and didn’t say anything. They just handed me the box.
Not cool.
After standing there for I don’t know how long telling them how they are ripping their customers off by doing false advertising the manager finally gave me back some not all of my money.
So if you want vanilla custard in any cake that you order, go somewhere else.; On the tag shows $0.89/lb but they charged me $0.99/lb. I bought almost 10lb.
They said they cannot refund me because I paid with wic card. So because I said I paid $9.39 so they should gave me the quantities for $9.39. If they cannot refund money they can give more oranges to make it right quantities for what I paid. But they refuse it and they said they cannot do anything.
Be careful on the prices. ALWAYS READ the receipt here!!!! it’s not 1st they charge more.
It’s not about money because it’s not a lot difference, but it’s their attitude and their customer service (I had to run back there to take a picture for them). And I have to pay their mistake!!!
Samething it happen to me long time ago at Walmart, and over there I received great service.
I didn’t had to run there to proof that their prices was wrong like what they let me did here.; I love buying groceries there. They always have everything what I want"

This is great for a good family outing and to support the local community.

If you are visiting please take the family out and visit the locals and support them.; The market was fantastic. They had a wide variety of local fruit and vegetables, a local cacao vender, plenty of juice stands, a couple bakeries, all the art vendors from Thursday, and my favorite, a local family that makes cheese from their cows. My only regret was not buying more cheese!

For fruit, we brought home Mamey Sapote (Three on top), Guayaba (guava), a coconut, dried starfruit, and something else I forgot the name of (maybe Jobo?) but is delicious!

We also brought home pickled local sweet peppers, which are incredible, that epic local cheese, and some tomatoes a guy grew in his backyard.

Most of the local bars and restaurants are open at the same time as the market, and the vibe is comfortable happy community island life.

Note the rig I didn't get at the market, I had to buy that at the smoke shop down the road 🤙🏼 And the sauce from a local medical Dispensary 😉; A bit pricey on some basic things from some people, like avocado for 4$ for one is too much, but two people down, guy had 2/4, but what's really good is the gyro and also things like cacao beans and plants. Love cilantro for 10$ a big planters worth .; Not really a farmer’s market, more of a food and crafts market.  Good variety of hand made stuff, some interesting food to try, too much jewelry, and lots and lots of small paintings, small woodwork, stickers, art, etc.  No bargains, no price gouging; everything seemed to be full retail price or negligibly more.  This is a good stop if you’re in the area, less rewarding if made a destination.  And, as with every other similar market I’ve seen, vendors leave early."

She created an amazing cake that exceeded my expectations! Elle was not only kind and soft-spoken, but she also demonstrated genuine care in her work and interactions.
In a world where good customer service can be hard to find, Elle truly stands out. Thank you, Elle, for being so amazing! I will definitely be returning to the bakery because of your outstanding service.; I go to this store almost daily.
It is clean, well-stocked, and has very capable, hard-working staff.
The fruit and vegetable selection is good and well-organized.

I'm generally ok using self-check out for small orders, but when I want to use a register with a staff member often there are only 1 or 2 registers open versus 5-11 self-check registers. Those often glitch (possibly user error some, but not all.).

The flower department is beautifully displayed and has seasonal plants and flowers.

The prices are, on the whole, better than Vons, but more than Target for the same items. Better selection than Target.

Parking is easy.

I like going to this market as it meets many of my grocery store needs.; Good selection of groceries. Usually has good produce. I've always felt this  store is more clean than most other grocery stores. But, also higher prices than most other grocery stores.; Best store in ventura. They do a great job. However, that being said, and it's saying a lot, it's still very cramped, and there's just too much noise in Commiefornia. It's too crowded. Too many people and their attitudes. So the experience isn't as good as it would be in a red state. Sorry, Ralph's. It's not you. It's politics and the location. The 1% so to say or mega coorperations want to take away our energy and take it for themselves and for AI computing, take away our air conditioners our jobs, our oil, and yet they still want to make everything more expensive so we are all a lowly working slave class.; I bought a Red Baron personal deep dish pizza today, expecting two pizzas in the box.

Unless you want to risk food poisoning, Don't buy food here!!; I go to the store mostly because South Omaha desperately needs a new grocery store and this is the only one in the area. It has some great qualities, I love their homemade tortillas, they have a lot of produce you can't get anywhere else, a great selection of both Hispanic and American foods and it's written on the aisle signs in both, they sell pinatas and they just opened self-checkout lanes that they desperately needed. My main issue with the store is cleanliness and customer service. For months you could smell dead mice right as you walked in the entrance. And the meat department offers a great selection but oftentimes the plastic they sit on is not clean. It was so gross the last time I went in I took pictures to send to the manager. As far as customer service goes as an example I had a money order I purchased there stolen and cashed. On the western union website they instruct you to let the store know bc the only place that can cash it is the store. The girl at customer service actually told me it was store policy if someone comes to cash it they can't keep their information to give to the police since it would be invading THEIR privacy. Apparently a person who would cash a money order they know they didnt purchase is protected instead of the customer that actually spends their money there. So long review summed up, great tortillas but not worth the risk of getting sick from dead mice in the store, dirty meat dept. , and TERRIBLE customer service. I will never shop here again!!; This store has a little bit of everything for a latin dish. Not to mention, I have searched high and low since moving here from fl for my favorite hot sauce ( Texas Pete) and EUREKA!!! they had it.; If you like fresh Mexican foods go here.

It’s as if you forced to deal with a 90 year old blind deaf cashier with Alzheimer’s sometimes. They always repeat to place items in the bagging area when they are and the machines all seem to glitch all the time.

Also I do not want to be referred to HR or customer service as it always leads to no resolve.

Update : ofcourse I was given a generic “reach out to HR message “ and the self check outs still haven’t improved; It's nice to have a bank conveniently in with the store!; I left my car at the parking lot after doing groceries for a couple hours and they got my car towed and they said now I have to deal with the towing company which is a terrible business that is closed on weekends the towing company treated me like garbage hang up on me when I asked if my car was in a covered garage, they said I can’t pick it up until Monday, they towed it on Friday night and it’s going to hail and there is a tornado warning and they said they are not responsible if my car gets damaged I’d have to use my insurance.; Has to sand tons of products but just have to be careful with produce and make sure you pick through it.; The staff consistently appears disgruntled and impolite, and the self-checkout machines are consistently slow and glitchy, making quick trips impossible.

Recently, opting for a traditional cashier line to avoid the sluggish self-checkout experience, I was disappointed when the cashier failed to alert me about the bagged items I left behind. Upon realizing the oversight at home, I called the store hoping to rectify the situation, only to be met with unprofessionalism from the person who answered the phone. It begs the question: what are the hiring standards here? Is there any accountability?

Returning to retrieve the forgotten item, I encountered further frustration as the cashier refused to acknowledge their mistake and insisted I pay again. Blaming me for not noticing their error, they refused to remedy the situation, resulting in the loss of my regular business over a mere $2 discrepancy."

Questions in the deli department.  It was a Mondnay about 11:00 AM. I was the only customer at the counter.  There were several people working there but they completely ignored me. Finally
after several minutes, I asked If someone could help me. An older woman came over and I told
her I needed slices of ham and cheese. I was standing right in front of the meats.  Instead of helping  she kept asking me question about brands. She was rude and and not helpful.
I am an 88 year old man, well groomed and soft spoken. I have never been treated in such a condescending manner. Please train your staff to attend to the live customers first.; Went in today, store was not busy so able to go right to checkout. I had items saved on a list that were on digital special and I asked cashier to help me understand how to use the app so items could be charged at sale price. Cashier was very abrupt, was able to get my discounts bit still completely in dark how to use app. Needless to say I have no desire to return and be treated so rudely.; Please be aware that this store is charging you a connivence fee for your cash back. They clearly do not say that on the card pad but it is as clear as day on the big screen by the cashier .
Once I saw the 75 cent charge for my 20.00 I cancelled my transaction .. Cashier said run the card again, which I did and I informed her that I did not want to pay the fee. She looked away rolled her eyes and treated me poorly with a bad attitude, when I stated that they should have it on the pad to inform the customer of the charge.
I came home and goggled is this practice legal ?? and it is NOT in the state of CA and there is a pending law suit against KROGER for doing so. This Ralphs is OVERPRICED and understaffed with rude individuals.

You can go to Staters or Albertsons across the street and there is no fees for cash back. I told a friend my story and her grandson wanted 100.00 back and they charged him 2.00 and he says they do it all the time.

I found this quote on line pertaining to this exact practice that we should not be charged.
****************************************************************
Adding a cash back fee whenever a customer completes a cash back transaction using a debit card would violate these rules. According to one article, by assessing these ""convenience"" fees, Kroger, the parent company of Ralphs, Food 4 Less, and Foods Co., is able to take an extra $75 million a year from its customers. The fifty cent fees add up.
*****************************************************************
They are making 75 million more a year on just that.. now let that one sink in.
On top of that we also pay for a bag fee , ridiculous and unethical.

Check your receipts or better yet find another store to shop in for better prices, better customer service and no illegal connivance fees.; Cashier named Juan is rude and discriminatory. Refused to help me and mocked me the entire time. Awful experience; Customer service at this store is not good. So when a young gentleman I recognized from the Indio store says hi to me..I was confused then I was so happy to see him.He was the reason I shopped the produce at the other store..I thought he quit.I would like to say that you have a great employee working for you now...the nicest toughest guy I have ever met. I believe his name is Eddie.No matter what he is doing he always went above and beyond to get me what I needed. Keep it up my friend!"

But you get to know really the business attitude when there is a problem. On Saturday (two days ago), I bought a bottle of Puerto Rican honey. (In general, I try to buy local products to favor local economy.) The honey had a stale, funny flavor, and thus I decided to return it. They wouldn't return the money because the bottle was open. I tried to no avail to explain to the manager (Carlos) that I wouldn't possibly know that the honey was stale without opening it. He even dared to say that he wouldn't taste it because he didn't know what I could possibly add to the honey. Anyhow, I was quite frustrated with the experience.; Microgreens, swiss chard, kale, bok choy, fresh green peas, locally grown tomatoes and cucumbers, this and much more are the delightful fresh veggies you can find at El Viandon.

Completed my shopping and headed to self check out.  The store has two sets of self check out lines on the east side of the store.   As I approached the open registers, the side with 4 self check out stations, I noticed two were not working and one was occupied but the last one had items at the register but no customer.   I was told the person ran back to grab an additional item but I could head to a register down the line to check out.  This did resolve my issue but I do not understand why open self check out when 2 of the 4 registers are not working??   Makes no sense to me but then again I do not work there.   This store is convenient although I do get some good deals, it just frustrates me when things like this happen.    Make it easy for your customers.    Why not make sure all registers are working for the convenience of your customer.; Walking into Fry’s Grocery Store is like stepping into a whimsical wonderland of culinary delights! The aisles are a treasure trove of surprises, each turn revealing a new adventure in grocery shopping. Who knew hunting for the perfect jar of peanut butter could feel like a playful scavenger hunt?

The produce section is a vibrant rainbow, bursting with colors and freshness that almost make you want to start a fruit bouquet business on the spot. And those quirky little signs with puns and jokes? They’re like a sprinkle of joy on your shopping trip, making you chuckle as you pick out your veggies.

The staff at Fry’s are like friendly neighborhood superheroes, always ready with a smile and a helpful tip. Need to find that obscure ingredient for your next culinary experiment? They’ve got you covered, and might even share a recipe or two!

And let’s talk about the bakery – it’s a sweet tooth’s paradise! The aroma of freshly baked bread and pastries is enough to make anyone’s day instantly better. Plus, the endless variety of snacks and treats makes it feel like a mini festival every time you visit.

In a nutshell, Fry’s Grocery Store isn’t just a place to shop – it’s an experience. It’s a delightful blend of convenience, quality, and a dash of fun that makes grocery shopping something to look forward to. So grab your cart, embrace the quirky charm, and enjoy the ride!; I shop here occasionally and always find the store clean and well stocked. Most of the employees are helpful and polite. However when I use the self checkout I’ve interacted with Pablo, who is consistently rude and condescending to customers. I avoid this man and I wasn’t surprised when I saw him square up with an elderly woman who was simply having issues using her coupons. She asked him to step back when talking to her and he responded, “Would you like to speak with a manager?” I could see she was becoming upset. I dread asking this man for any assistance.; Advertised BOGO on stevia sweetener… got to register didn’t give me the discount. After review they claim it should have been discounted and asked me 3 times what I wanted to do. I want the deal. They claimed I had to come back. I have 2 kids under 2 years old. Just getting to the store once with them is hard enough. Not happy with the customer service that’s why I rated 1 star.; Would give 0 stars if I could!  Ordered deli trays one week ago and still waiting over 30 minutes and counting to get my food!  DO NOT order from here if you need food on time.  So far one tray of 4 came out and brought one that I didn’t order.  Appalled by lack of customer service at this store!  The one tray that came out looked like a 2 year old put it together!

I’ve been waiting 45 minutes so far with only 1 item of 4 done.  The gentleman next to me has been well over an hour.  Don’t bother complaining to customer service because they don’t care!!"

The area is clean and fairly well lit at night.  There are several empty spaces.  I don't know if they are vacancies or if they were recently built out for incoming tenants.  Either way, it is a good area to find many things you need, have lunch or dinner, or to hang out for some entertainment.; Beautiful shipping area.

to rent beach chair or umbrellas being
that there is no major hotel on the beach to do so, so bring your own. This is mostly a beach around residential community. There is a restaurant/bar by the beach with free outdoor shower.

Definitely a very beautiful family friendly beach.; Good place to relax and enjoy the breeze.; As usual street parking can be tricky but not impossible. Really convenient bars and restaurants right on C, facing the beach. There are plenty of picnic tables to sit at and lovely palm trees to sit under. The waves can be choppy so the first waves are a bit heavy with sand and sea plants. There was no life hard on the beach so do take care. On this side of the island the waves are formidable. If you venture past the poles it can be be much deeper and more dangerous. There are no rentals here- there used to be but not anymore. The only negative is the dude walking around ogling young ladies and touching himself. But over all a wonderful sunny yet shady afternoon listening to the crash of the waves on the beach.

PLEASE! 🙏; It’s a big El Super ;) This is the Sam’s Club of IE. This one is the bigger El Super that has more variety and a bakery, butcher shop, fish and you name it. The only thing it does not have is a restaurant. Somewhat overpriced but it’s California can’t expect any different. The deli department is huge too and they sell you everywhere behind the counter.; I called to speak with a family member that works there and the lady who answered was giving me attitude for no reason very rude and disrespectful. I asked to speak with a manager and she refused to transfer me to one. No need to take it out on others either get a new job or change your attitude. So the owner should check his employees and get people who actually want to work; Parking was super easy, products are neatly placed. Staff is always very friendly and helpful at the bakery and meat counter. Things are easy to find and locate. I love coming here to shop, because service here is far better than asian supermarket.; I went on 06/19 and I’m once again disappointed. Lines were super long, I’m talking back of the isles long!!!  There was only three registers open and it was only 8:00pm. I love shopping here but the lines are always out of control. They need to hire more people. Costumers were leaving because of how long the lines were."

The best supermarket in this area. You are always greeted when entering the store, store is always super clean and the aisles are neatly stocked. From the manager all the way to the employees who clean the floors everyone is kind, helpful and looking to find what you need.

This store has the best quality of meat and the best prices for their fresh cut meat than all the bigger stores. When you are looking for something and they don't have it, ask the manager, they will have as soon as is humanly possible and at a great price too.; Is almost empty. Service good; Someone stopped me while I was shopping and accused me of being from another supermarket because I was checking wine reviews (they thought I was marking prices). This place is dirty too and full of junk food. They profit mostly off of welfare recipients so they sell cheap stuff.; Some items are very expensive compared to other grocery stores. They sell bags of discounted/clearance items (as many grocery stores do) both times we have purchased these items the packaged goods have all been so far beyond the expiration date that the food has been inedible.; Alot of personal to help their customers. Service with a smile. I do t speak Spanish and the people knew English to assist me. Very friendly customer service. Prices are average for their large inventory. The building looks small from the outside but inside is a good size. The condition of the store is in fair condition. I would definitely recommend this Grocery store to everyone. Parking is right in front of the store and to the right of building. They have plenty of parking for the handicap close to the store. They also will take your groceries to your car to assist you. Shopping carts seem to be in fair condition and they have enough for all their customers."

The time here was excellent, informative, and delicious! We received a tour of the grounds where we were shown the herbs, fruits, and vegetables that are raised to support residents and local restaurants.

We were also treated to a three-course meal on-site. The meal was delicious, fresh, and truly excellent.

The last event during our visit was to watch the making of queso fresco (and to taste it!). We were also served a mango gazpacho that was excellent.

If you have an interest in sustainable farming, excellent food, and people who truly have a dedication to their work, then this is a must-visit place in Puerto Rico.

Oh, and there are goats, chickens, turkeys, and other animals around, which made it all very fun!; The farm tour was an amazing and memorable experience. Learned so much about milking goats, sustainability, farming, planting, food and their different ongoing projects. Everyone I met who works here is lovely. I was also able to push my 6 month old around in her stroller throughout the tour. Lastly, all the food I ate/drank (fruits, tastings, sorbet, lemonade, passion fruit juice, and a 3 course lunch) was incredibly DELICIOUS. Everyone who visits Puerto Rico needs to visit this farm. Hope to visit in the future to purchase local honey again.; Absolutely wonderful experience for our family. Carlos is a brilliant guide and you can sense the love that everyone working here has for the farm. We spent nearly four hours and left feeling like we had become part of the place. It's truly special. We also gained new respect for the island and for the work that goes into bringing the wonderful food items to one's table. Highly recommend.; We had an exceptional time at Fritos del Guacabo. Carlos, our tour guide, showed us the many herbs and edible flowers grown. We tasted everything. We visited the greenhouses. We petted and milked the goats. The snack (more like a feast) of locally grown fruits and cheeses was delightful. And the lunch was over the top good. Vegetarian options available. This was definitely a highlight of our trip to Puerto Rico.; Excellent experience!! The true farm to table excursion of Puerto Rico. Book with Warren International Travel to add this experience to your trip."

I felt like if I were in a Mexican store. The lady who was in cashier is absolutely nice and kind, she helped us very much.

In addition, there are many products available to purchase, not only from Mexico and other Latin America countries.

They accept payments with credit cards.

Certainly, I recommend it.; The only reason I shop here is because my mom sends me here to get meat. She likes it here because there's less people than at other stores and they have a variety of meats. But look at their produce 🤢 Also, while I was at the register, there was another customer who was not social distancing and the employee said nothing to him. I felt very uncomfortable as he kept getting closer, just not happy that employees don't care to keep their customers safe 😷; Great selection of meat, chicken and pork great for BBQN!! There produce isn't all that great and they don't have all the products like a lot of grocery stores do. This is the spot for your BBQ  needs from carne asada , ribs, marinaded chicken  etc; They have many items, the only problem is that some groceries are not so good and expensive. Especially in the fruits and vegetables section. Sometimes bakery French bread is to steale and other times is good. The advertise items sometimes are spoiling they need better supervision in having fresh items on display. Advertising tags are not accurate with system, you have to be letting cashier know otherwise you get a different price. Sometimes with a bad attitude, they will change it but after calling manager to do the change. One of the cashier wasn't so friendly gave me attitude, and discussion before calling the manager who probably wasn't having a good day either because she had a very anxious attitude but finally changed the price of item. Store very equipped with variety of items but does need more organization and supervision of checking groceries freshness. Otherwise it would be a very convenient place to shop for almost everything. Hopefully they can improve so they can move up their stars.; Small Latino groceries store. It is cheaper compared to other places and the service is fast. They have fried tilapia in the carniceria area. You can also send money to your country. Huge parking lot. Most of the cashiers are very young and not friendly. There is no line when it comes to paying, so you kind of just go in and out. I gave it 3 starts because it doesn't feel clean, and it feels crowded with groceries. I recommend it because prices are worth it."

Highly recommend this location and will return, friendly staff as well.; I find Grocery Outlet to be great for buying groceries at a discount price, but I found a few issues here. The front entrance is almost always closed so you have to go through the entrance at the parking lot. I know it’s a small sized store, but somehow they have an insufficient amount of shopping carts and baskets. Also be cautious if you’re buying meat here, as some may have gone past the expiration date and still sitting on the shelves.; I can't say enough about the deals I find at the store. I love my sardines. You guys have some great deals.

They have all of the usual and basic grocery items. Usually when I come, there are decent deals on certain groceries and a wide variety. They almost always have my mom’s favorite vegetables and greens. It is often crowded, however, and gets tough during peak times.

The meat deli counter was really crowded today and they don’t have a number system so it was pretty hectic. My mom and I waited for 10 minutes before we were helped because people kept cutting in front of us.

Compared to other supermarkets in the area, this one is actually kind of small. There are less than 10 aisles and it’s also kind of dirty. Being dirty is actually pretty normal for Asian supermarkets, but this one seems a lot dirtier than others. The parking might be difficult as well because it’s in the heart of Little Saigon, right across the Asian Garden Mall, and in a popular plaza. My family and I always manage to find a parking spot though so it shouldn’t be too big of a problem.

Overall, a decent choice.; Best way I can put it. It’s basically like a 99 ranch market except a bit more local/Vietnamese oriented. I did find these 3 in 1 instant coffees which are great for when you’re on the go and need a quick pick me up.; Supermarket has everything you need to cook your Vietnamese dishes. From produce, to meats and seafoods, to dry goods. Every area is labeled for your convenience. Store generally doesn't smell like some other markets I've been to. Clean store compared to others. Prices are good. They usually are at where other competitors if not, beat their prices. Overall, great market.; I absolutely love Little Saigon!! They made their meat loaf fresh each and every day! Coming from Utah, we appreciate all the delicious food they have to offer. This is just one of the supermarkets, and they are plenty more!!; It's my To-Go place for Vietnamese ingredients most of the time. The price is usually good and competitive, especially meat. But Fruits and Vegetables are sometimes fresh, sometimes soso. The way they display the sale prices with bright pink papers are easier to locate compared to other supermarkets. The only inconvenience is the annoying parking lot."

Food often expired and the cakes often looked unprofessionally decorated. Fruits in the fruit cakes are often molded and heavily covered in gelatin.
Every time I come I have to be extra careful and check the expiration dates and inspect the fresh produce.
I think San Antonio deserves better.; We purchased a Central Market custom vase floral arrangement and an Anthony’s chocolate mousse cake from here. The flowers were absolutely gorgeous and the chocolate mousse cake was excellent. This is our go to place for the best chocolate mousse cake around. This cake is always fresh and tastes very good. The floral arrangements are second to none! Absolutely stunning flowers! The flower arrangements can be pricey depending on what you purchase but you get your money’s worth. You will not be disappointed! We visit here often for fresh pastries, fresh meats, fresh fruits, artisanal meats and cheeses and fresh vegetables. Absolutely love their store selection of groceries. Great customer service. Ample parking.
Will definitely return again and would certainly recommend this place.; We bought our florals for our wedding here and they were so gorgeous, and reasonably priced. I didn't get photos of everything, but I had a cascading bouquet, baby's breath bouquets for my bridesmaids, boutineers, and corsages for our flower girls. It was all so nicely made.; Adorable! Got some tiramisu today. Had a complimentary snack. The ladies must have known that I hadn’t eaten much all day because they were just so sweet."

Starting from the parking lot, they’re doing a lot of renovations so half of the lots is filled up with shipping containers. Not to mention this HEB gets so much traffic so it makes it worse to even park.

Going inside is another battle and they’re so many people that it’s really hard to walk by isles. Doesn’t matter what time you come it’s always busy.

Lots of the isle are closed and rearranged so it makes it really hard to find items such as bread placed right near all the cleaning supplies.

Lots of the produce is rotting and has low quantities.

This is the closest HEB to me and it really disappoints me that HEB doesn’t pay attention to the low income communities, I get that Alon Heb has higher income & north side communities have more money to have better facilities.

But it makes me sad that Heb doesn’t focus on the real issues in the west, south & east side lower income communities.

All that being said this Heb is wack.; This HEB is huge and has a ton of selections on everything. The staff is very helpful. However they could get some more parking for the curbside orders. Last time I had issues finding a slot to park in cause they were all taken.; Is the bakery manager proud of this? Because it's on display. Love the chips but can't buy them here. Half full bag of chips for full price. I go to any other store and they are full bags. Embarrassing...; Waited in the curbside for about 25)30 minutes for only 2 baby formula an waters . An there's other cars who got there stuff first but haven't been waiting for more then 10 minutes. Horrible service. You can't say there short staffed cause heb never is.; Ordered a birthday cake! I expected a better-looking cake for the price. Especially for a small cake. Writing should have been on top of the cake instead of the side of the cake. The ribbon with writing made it tacky!"

Now I think I found my new favorite HEB store in San Antonio. We will be back!!; I love HEB it's a very good store well stocked low prices even because of the economic downturn we're seeing in the economy they still try to help everyday families with meal deals and specials and buying things in large amounts and giving discounts. Use the digital coupons and the in-store coupons and try to get the best grocery prices that you possibly can much better selection than Walmart.; I visited HEB (near De Zavala road) today. The store was amazing. The way the products were displayed were spectacular. The produces were arranged in such a manner that it’s pleasant to the eyes. Great work team. Much appreciated.; There’s a good reason why I only gave it 3 stars. This store is very limited with products. Don’t get me wrong they do have items but not like the store on huebner store And this is also said by their own employees.  They even say,It doesn’t carry a lot products  like the other big stores hair products they can have more.   like the store  on Huebner /Babcock rd.  De Zavala HEB It’s closer to me. However I won’t go there. My son also works for a HEB store on the other side of town.  And even  he noticed the same thing.  I didn’t have to tell him anything.  When we were having a cookout this summer.  You will find out for your self go and look for a product that your going to want they don’t carry what item. Like other HEB stores carry and  they should . It’s a big store there’s no reason.  Also for the longest time all HEB stores do not have Apple Pay. And just last week this store now has Apple Pay so that’s a good thing for all of us that have apple phones.  You got there you’ll love that .  However I was told not all HEB store are on board with Apple Pay.; I love my HEB and this review for delivery guy curly hair! For the LOVE OF GODS, PLEASE, tell your delivery drivers to keep their darn music down, there is a guy right now it's 4PM delivering food at the Stonehouse apartments, and the music is so high that our walls are shaking. Some of us have small kids and they might be sleeping, and that is unacceptable. This is not a open road or something, there are people living here, some of them are small kids and some of them are old and maybe sick. Thank you!!"

Let me tell you why, one day I was shopping with my wife and my sugars had dropped a little low and during this time they were doing sampling and got a little piece of a granola bar and the young lady was kind enough to give me a whole granola bar. its nice to know there are kind people working here. i dont know her name but big shout out to her.; Preeti, thank you so much for the amazing cake design. Went above and beyond :,) I know my coworkers will love it! You’re the best! First time using HEB bakery for cakes and def will be my go to!; This is the only HEB that has issues that I've experienced. Had to wait over 5 minutes as the guest in front had a coupon issue and the cashier and manager didn't use walkie talkies to verify that they'll honor the price. My frozen stuff was almost thawed out.; I had a little over 10 items and some girl came over and said I would have to go to a different line. There were at least 6 registers open with no line and was hardly busy in the store. I came down with food poisoning and had not eaten in 48 hours and was just getting some soups and crackers and drinks. I said I was just not feeling well and if I could just checkout quickly to get back home I would appreciate it. She said no and turned the register off right in front of me. Unprofessional, lack of empathy, and just a cold person. I will not be coming back to this location.; I worked for HEB for almost 15 years. I saw a company that cared for its partners community and customers… even neighbors! Now that being said I have taken what I learned in my management positions with in the company where I grew up and kept a lot of my work ethic and heart for others when training and working where I work now. My fiance and I had such a bad experience with this location on culebra and 1604. We had came home after our one of many grocery trips with some not so cheap steaks that had a whole in the wrap covering the steaks. I of course called the store to let them know which around closing time for business center… no problem I could bring it in at a later date. Being a working women raising kids and what not my fiance finally said hunny do you want me to take that meat back- two weeks later. I said yes and that’s where the problem began. He called me so upset saying there was horrible customer service kept saying we were trying to scam heb.  Saying it’s not their fault we kept the meat that they would not replace. When he told me this it got me very heated. I called and spoke to a child that was telling me same thing that we were trying to take from the comapny. Mind you again I had worked almost 15 years with The company 10 being management. Laughing saying same thing over and over. I asked for names and told them I did not  appreciate how either one of us were treated. Laughed some more passed phone to next mic. Now another kid saying we can not give out our names. I asked for upper management to contact me nothing!! A lot of stuff in between back and forth heb policy wise- H‑E‑B  guaranteed products 100% . We did not want our money back we wanted to replace our meat again that was not cheap. We even said we will pay difference. Now fast forward my other half is finishing shopping for diapers meat and other things we needed for our family. Now he is being followed in the store. He is covered in paint from restoring old vintage cars… being targeted and again followed through out the store as if he is going to steal. I called back to store and those two managers  opening  said we were watching to make sure he wasn’t gonna put meat back and steal fresh meat. Oh at this point I was so upset ! How could these bad apples do this to such a good company. How many people did they make feel like the way we do.Again never received a call back. Called and spoke to a lady that did give me her name but told me the same thing. They don’t honor hebs 100% guaranteed for meat even though it was damaged. that for meat that i would have to take the loss that is why I wasn’t contacted back. Oh and then later said It was never communicated about this. ( which I had to call and contact them again today) I called that evening this happened  to another store. I will say this Will the mic from Potranco location… he is what makes HEB the top store!! He is the reason the company has such a well respected name .He apologized multiple times and said that is not the correct representation of the company. To take the meat back to his store and he would replace it for us. My fiance had already trashed the meat on his way home.said not ever has he gone to a store and made feel this way. We are in our thirty’s we work hard for our family. I was not going to go take it out of the trash!!! Now I’m to the point that just because I can’t fix this from the inside like I could of before and keep the heb proud work ethic- or taking this and coaching my partners I can be the voice as a customer. I a proud heb customer and say this is not hebs way to make people feel horrible!! To make people that work hard to be kind hearted people and do the right thing. We did not want our money back… maybe if this was delivered a better way would I not have to handle this on google!"

No actual cashiers. I was told they could help me check myself out.  I noped and left the groceries I was going to purchase and left the store.

They made the aisles longer and closer together so it's hard to get around. When the aisles were split in 2 you could easily go find what you need and get out. Now I don't know where anything is. They changed the sign colors from green and orange to a bland white and blue. It's hard to park now.
They moved the pickup parking spots to where the gas pumps are.  My usual parking spot.
No longer your friendly neighborhood walmart. It's just down the road but I'd rather go to heb now.

Needless to say I won’t be returning again.; This is the smallest Walmart I have ever been too , it’s has veggie, groceries  , pharmacy , cosmetics, small session of seasonal toys , it’s was neat and clean , you can find the Walmart gas station opposite to it which makes it convenient if you want to fill up the gas .

Thanks for ripping me off; Let me start by saying that my family and I love this location. All of the staff is amazing. This review is based solely on the floral department. I spoke to someone in this department at least 2 monthsb ago. I don't remember the exact date. I asked about getting a replica floral arrangement of my wife's bouquet for our anniversary. 5 bright blue hydrangea as base and 6-7 ivory roses topped with white gardenia. I know gardenias is pricey. They called me 3 weeks ago and told me the price for the arrangement. So I went in to pay for the arrangement because the gardenias are expensive they required payment at least this is what i was told. I then got a call on Sunday before I was supposed to pick them up on Thursday to inform me that they could not get the gardenias, so my opinions were cancel the order, I can go by fake flowers and they will just add the to the arrangement of substitute for a different flower. When I went to pick them up on Thursday, I asked if I was going to get some sort of rebate, but I was told (no, this is what you get). This department is not worth it. Destiny is amazing, and she is the only reason that I would buy flowers from here again, but I would never even recommend ordering specialty flowers from them again. They ruined my anniversary.; Newly renovated just like all the new HEBs being built. They also have Turkey Legs which are hard to find 🦃"

The people here are also really sweet, I tend to chat with some of the stockers every time I'm there. Just a really good, affordable place overall ❤️; The customer service was top-notch, with attentive and friendly staff who went above and beyond to meet my needs. The quality of the product exceeded my expectations, showcasing excellent selection. The entire process, from ordering to delivery, was seamless and efficient. I highly recommend this company to anyone looking for outstanding products and superior service. I will definitely be a returning customer!; This is the sketchiest sprouts I’ve ever been to. None of the employees look like they even want to be there. The cashiers are extremely slow, almost feels intentional. Then they can’t even be bothered to apologize for the wait or to even greet you with a smile. The cashier I had was very snooty.  The self check out lanes were roped off so you have no choice but to wait in line forever. This whole place has a weird vibe and I didn’t even feel safe in the parking lot.  Definitely not coming back to this location.; It was a nice shopping experience. Came to look for castile soap and a face serum. Found it right here. No complaints...; I go here twice maybe three times a week and I buy mainly organic foods. In the last 2 years, I figured they would change their way of handling produce and even storing process. Theres not a single visit that goes by that I find moldy fruit. Bruised fruit. Even some expired produce. Pathetic. And when you try asking a question, it’s as if you’ve bothered them. Meh. Other than that, their vitmain section is good. Meat dept could at least have someone at the from at all times. It sucks to wait........and wait. But their. Biggest downfall, is how they only have two registers open. When they call for back up, managers do not even hurry to assist. They walk and look at you like a deer on headlight. They also recently added two express lanes but they’re non existent. It’s more a Mural than anything."

It’s like going to Walmart with a red color scheme…nasty meat and rude employees.  Went to the meat department, all the Milanese steaks were turning green, no problem, it happens sometimes…take an uncut “eye round” to the butcher to see if he can just slice this piece up for me since the others are TURNING GREEN.  He says we don’t do that and I can’t help you.  I didn’t mind coming to HEB and paying a little more, I like supporting Texas companies and they used to have better quality products.  It’s a shame how far they’ve fallen…see attached pictures for the “quality” steaks HEB sells.; You can tell this a very affluent side of town.  The HEB plus near me doesn't look nearly this nice.  Very big and fancy looking.  It has a sit in area and a garden center.; Lately when I buy fruits from HEB within couple of days the fruits go bad, I work 12 hours a day. I don’t have time to go return the fruits to them,I’m very disappointed with heb products. I will not buy fruits from heb again.; Great store.  I liked the layout.  Was trying to find something, so I asked a worker in the store.  They looked it up on their phone and pointed me to the right aisle.  Service with a smile.  I love HEB, and it's nice to find one where the people are as nice as the one close to me - traveling and visiting family.; Usually, this HEB location is great. Been going to it the last 3 years. Never have I ever had one complaint about HEB in my entire life.
Today, I was getting checked out by (my receipt says) Kathy L.
Not a smile or a hello or any greeting. She seemed to have an upset/disgust look on her face. I made a little joke about the raw chicken and not once did she acknowledge me speaking. She didn’t even tell me my total I had to ask if she was ready for me to pay. Handed me my receipt and said here you go.
Hope she has a better day.
Other than that, this HEB location is always great."

I got it for my brother’s birthday. I even got 2 of them because I wanted everyone to try it since I had loved it so much.. well, I was so disappointed when we cut into the cake, it had a price of parchment paper along the middle section… I can’t believe Whole Foods would let something like get by.; My sister and her special needs class went to have lunch here. Unfortunately she had a bad experience. They were looking forward to having pizza but the workers were not working. They were just talking to each other and they didn’t even greet her or her class mates. So they left and decided to have lunch somewhere else. I’ve worked in fast food places for many years and I know what it’s like to get rude customers and develop an attitude where you just don’t want to talk to anyone, but they’re are still customers who need assistance & I hope that they can work at being better at helping their customers.; What a shame. Ever since Amazon took over they treat their staff badly and have priced themselves out of the market. I used to go all the time. I no longer think it's value or even quality. I prefer central market for luxury or clean food. It's a real shame they used to be excellent. But health should not be at this price. Plus they no longer sell the vast selection of makeup they used to which was great and they don't sell as much foreign import or seasonal food. Overall not recommended.; The store is stocked with a wide variety of high quality healthy and organic items. You can find something for everyone.
The store is clean and well organized.  Yet, the elderly female cashier could use more customer service training. She didn't greet nor acknowledge me when I was paying.  She was too busy yapping with the young bagger.  I rate based on customer service 1st. This place gets 3 stars, particularly because of my experience with that cashier.  Regardless, come check them out for yourself!; They are always decent never disappoint, except I am kind of mad they got rid of the carts for kids. Overall the deli always has really good meats and the soap selection is nice."

I love all the products and how clean and well stocked everything always is!  I got some soap bars and got a 33% discount because I have Amazon Prime 😁👏🏼🤩

Restrooms are always clean, and everyone is always helpful and nice.  I love the space outside where I can enjoy a healthy meal I just got from the salad bar, and the overall environment is great!; Good selection of items you can't find at other grocery stores but a bit pricey.

**update** I used to go there because they had a bar that had a good rotation of beers every couple of weeks and i could sit there while my wife shopped; they removed it. I then kept going there because they still had several unique beers to choose from in their alcohol section. They no longer have a diverse enough selection to justify me getting my beer there. They still periodically have great deals on fruits though.; Good WFs, as its clean, large, nicely laid out, has both indoor and outdoor seating, easy parking, etc.
I’d love to see better grab and go food, or hot bar offerings. Myself and my coworkers rely heavily on these amenities since we travel almost every week and need healthy food options that don’t use inflammatory oils and other harmful products. But it seems like WFs is still behind the curve on this one. Otherwise, to the average customer, this is a great stop for necessities.; I enjoy shopping at Whole Foods. Unfortunately, San Antonio only has 2 in the entire huge City of San Antonio! Compared to much smaller cities, like Minneapolis, MN, there you can find 5 WHOLE FOODS MARKET!!! They also have a much better selection!
This Whole Foods on Blanco Road in S.A. is getting worse by the month! The Bakery has a sad selection, and  Rotisserie chickens are not done until way after lunch hours! Compared to other states, this WHOLE FOODS MARKET is an embarrassment. I have to drive 20 miles to get to the nearest Whole food market in San Antonio, which is embarrassing enough for such a large city, just to find out, that I will not get many products in this store!"

I called ahead to see if this location carried some cards (since some smaller neighborhood markets sizes will have some at the checkout station) but I was very rudely informed over the phone that they did not carry this item by Christian. I remained very friendly, and I was glad I called ahead since it turned out they didn’t have the item, although the level of rudeness was extremely palpable and unnecessary. I was also hung up on almost immediately. I work in costumer service myself, so while I understand a long day, I’m hoping my next call or visit will be met with more civility and kindness.; I just want to mention that the Walmart Neighborhood Market concept has turned  out to be a fantastic success story seldom acknowledged anywhere.  The food quality is better than I expected by light-years with truly fair pricing all the While.  While the H-E-B  and Walmart Mega-Store  down the street are a sea of chaotic Suburban mayham I grin as I go the back way, down  an empty street nobody knows about, only to arrive at  this brand new store with an honestly small town vibe.  What I noticed was that people actually talk to each other instead of desperately trying not to run into each other.  Sometimes it's the simple things that make a place truly unique.; The supervisor this location she's really rude. I have been shopping from this store for almost 10 years and the last couple times I'm in and she's not nice. I have been working customers service too but never treated people this way. I saw her stand at the customers service and I asked if I can get cigarettes and she said if I can read the sign. Another times she's telling to get out with my puppy,,  I don't know that I can't take dog in there but she should be little nice to tell me.; Y’all need to carry the new @BeatBox flavors and show some patriotism lol.

Hard to get in and out parking spots with all the traffic moseying through.
Inside the store was nice, only thing is that all the scan and go registers were ""CARD ONLY.""
They had only 1 register open for cash payments. The line was very long.
There were 3 employees just standing at the front of registers doing nothing. Walmart be slacking a lot lately at quite a few locations in san antonio.
There is an H.E.B. right down the street from here on New Guilbeau. OPT TO GO THERE INSTEAD.; This neighborhood walmart is the worst one I've ever been in. The customer service is horrible. They depend on the self checkouts and huff and puff if they have to actually do their job of checking out a customer! There is one truly lazy chick in there that looks like she'd rather be anywhere in the world BUT at work at Walmart. There are sometimes elderly people in carts and she doesn't lift a finger to help. If someone needs a price check she acts like they asked her to walk to Russia instead of doing her job to by pressing a few buttons on the computer register. The problem is that  she's not the ONLY lazy one, she's just the laziest one! Lately, I've been driving to the  neighborhood store on Hunt and Military just to avoid the poor service at Tezel.; overall no issues, however there are never enough baskets to shop, and it isn't due to the fact everyone is using one, there's only 6-8 from what I counted. Some need to be put on order. constantly have to ask selfcheckout  for one and doesnt seem they are making an attempt to grab them and put them up front by their feet let alone the front door when shoppers are done with them. small store = more small baskets.

I will note I asked the self check out for one, and rather than looking to see if one is sitting unused under the counters I got ""oh they most all be in use"" went and got one myself

otherwise lines are quick, store is coldest store which I love, and nearby making it
convenient

please order baskets
Thanks, - your local shopper; Quick and convenient. Easy to get in and get out, but still a great selection. And the same price as big Walmart! The majority of checkout aisles are self-checkout making it even simpler to get what you need quickly.
One complaint: It is cold in this store. 🥶; This is actually a nice little store. They keep it well stocked and clean, and the people are friendly. It’s a lot easier to get in and out of than the larger Walmarts."

The Molina's Hamburger Combo was Delicious,  fresh Vegetables, Tasty Good Meat, Nice puffy Buns and what I really liked there was No Grease coming out of the Burger. Just for this Tasty Delicious Burger and the CLEANEST of the Store they get 3 stars🌟
I will come again but I will leave if these Restrooms ARE NOT FIXED.; This store gets 1 star today because I am sincerely grieved by what I have just experienced. What I thought was a little gem, became one of my WORST experiences with customer care to date. RUDE staff. I have an office across the street and walked over with to grab a bite btw clients. Its Good Friday. I chose the fish plate (rice, beans, and I asked for a popper). I was handed a ticket that I took to the clerk. The clerk stated she did not need my ticket. As I do not know their procedures, it had appeared they'd conferred regarding my order. I paid via Apple Pay and leave.

No sooner was I headed to cross the street did I hear commotion behind me, I helpful bystander, ""hey!"" and gesturing over to the clerks and guard by the door, ""You didn't pay for that popper!"" Mind you this is a $3-$4 item and I'm getting accused as if I've stolen something, essentially front of my own business with clients on the way, smh. I state that I did offer to hand her my ticket and she just went on, ""I don't know what you order by that ticket."" As if I am to know what their procedures are... smh.

She said she had it, ""you got the plate."" At the counter (and with more privacy), I let her know that I did not appreciate her attitude with me either. It became an argument with me, as the customer, that she did not HAVE an attitude, that she would have had to pay for that pepper popper. I did let her know that that information was not necessary, that her attitude was NOT okay! The 2nd clerk, that I thought would intervene with de-escalation tools for customer care, instead escalated with, ""WELL IF YOU DON'T LIKE OUR ATTITUDE HERE THEN YOU CAN LEAVE!! AND DON'T COME BACK IN HERE!!"" AND proceeded to ask the security to escort me out. Once outside, I was grateful for him as he held space with me, meeting me with professionalism and basic civility. I recommend this security guard, Officer Mata, provide this STAFF with a training on handling community. He was amazing. Had any given juncture of this ordeal been met with ""our apologies, we failed to ring up an item, would you mind, xyz.."" this would have been a small matter. Instead I was met with JUVENILE BEHAVIOR and a SENIOR staff endorsing it. As a psychotherapist working across the way, ESPECIALLY, this public display and accusation could have threatened my business this day, not to mention my LICENSE for failure comply with law. ETHICAL standards ought to apply everywhere, treating customers with DECENCY from homeless to fellow businesses alike. I honestly felt targeted as I am also a black woman as well. It wreaked of micro-aggression. I will ABSOLUTELY hold my responsibility for ADVOCATING against social injustice until I meet with management or hear back from corporate, SOMEONE, that represents the company, that can respond with civility instead of BANNING me for being severely grieved today. God HELP US.; I stop there almost every morning for various stuff. I don't know her name but her and her son have both helped me. They are so respected by me . Becky is so kind helpful she is asome. also The whole staff there is top notch. Food is always the best. Management go ahead give them all raise.

I have been going here for the prices of some products but am seriously considering to no longer go just due to the horrible customer service. Not sure if the employees are mistreated or what but management should pay attention and train staff to use common courtesy with the customers. I do not recommend. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻; UPDATED: I lived across the street literally AND this was not my first bad experience with them. This is just the time when I decided was enough. I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. They failed me every time, until, the third time was a charm. Also, the previous issues had to do with their hot food section. Now to continue back to the review...... I go here ALL the time and spend daily. I spend over 10+ dollars a day and MORE. I just had a bad experience with them a bit ago. I went to buy some eggs size jumbo and a pound of pinto beans. I only had 5.57 to spend because I'm a lil low on cash due to not getting paid until Wednesday. I was paying attention to prices I mean it was ONLY 2 ITEMS. The eggs and many other dozen cartons were placed under the price of 3.39 and the beans were 1.69 for a total of 5.08. Why was the total 6.08 and they were charging me 4.49 for the eggs. I was a bit embarrassed due to not having enough so I just had her put the beans back and I paid for the eggs and left. I realized when I got home so I called them. The man tried blaming the customers saying they move things around. I explained to him there was several cartons there. He asked me to walk back WITH THE EGGS and receipt so that he could give me the eggs for the price. Then I let the girls know and they DENY me by giving me another excuse saying that's what they cost and they had to make room for them to fit. What does putting them under a price that's UNDER A DOLLAR MORE got to do with yall not having room for your product that you're choosing to sell. Don't over order if you have no room. That was rude and not considerate of a walking, paying customer. Aside from making me walk back just to tell me NO THAT'S WHAT THEY COST.

However, my recent experiences have been consistently disappointing.  The most significant issue is their inaccurate pricing. On numerous occasions, I've been overcharged at the register. The shelf price simply doesn't match what I end up paying, and it's always in the store's favor.

What makes this problem even worse is the unhelpful and unfriendly attitude of the staff. When I bring the price discrepancies to their attention, I'm often met with indifference and a lack of any genuine apology.  It feels like they don't value my business or care about correcting their mistakes.

Natural Grocers, you need to address these issues immediately.  Accurate pricing and respectful customer service should be a priority. Until then, I'll be taking my business elsewhere.; Very beautiful grocery store with all organic and natural ingredients. My husband and I really enjoyed looking around at all the phenomenal products. The prices are well out of affordable, but we did purchase some yogurts that were reduced by 50% as they were expiring in two days. I’d love to come again.; Love this store. The prices aren't your typical grocer, but it's similar to Amazon prices and no wait time. Super friendly staff. Rewards card, special sales for N rewards customers. Have all my favorite things and then some. Great selections on all accounts. Always clean, staff is knowledgeable about their products. My food is more delicious than ever.

*update... cashier had to ask me what my turnip was. Eggs aren't 2$ anymore, sales are still excellent. Lip balm is the best. Same store months later, will always go back here.; The place is all right if you like that pricey organic natural stuff.. I have no issues with the place, but it's just not my usual go to grocery store. But overall it's clean, nice & and the service has been friendly.; Disorganized and expensive. Compared to Sprouts, Whole Foods, or Central Market, this place has much higher prices than any of them. Also the staff are very disorganized, there must be issues with the systems they use on the back end of things. The staff are friendly, and they are doing the best they can, so they aren't at fault. However with how inefficient everything here is, it's almost always better to shop elsewhere.
The only redeeming benefit is that the Natural Grocers branded products are high quality and affordable. Stuff like the lip balm and specialty flours are an amazing value. So I do still shop here for those things every 6 months or so, but that's it."

We always find the freshest vegetables and fruits. Lines were very short for a weekend. They have a huge parking lot and also some street parking. I am sure when Chinese New Year is here the Great Wall Supermarket will be very busy. This is a great place to shop in the San Gabriel Valley area.; This Asian grocery store have alot of selection of herbs, dried chilies and spice. The kind lady who was ringing me up was very helpful.

No gula melaka, you'll have to use gula jawa, or palm sugar from Vietnam. Rather like Hawaii Supermarket but with a better parking situation and less crowded.
On April 28, 2022, I note that inflation is affecting certain items more than others. Some 3-in-1 coffee packs have jumped from under $6 to $9.99, condensed milk squeezable bottles are at $3.99 from pre-covid prices of $2.39, etc.
With their new store opening in Temple City (where the k-mart was), shoppers were drawn away.; GW Supermarket is a huge grocery store that mostly sell Asian products. Parking lot is huge.

There is so much space that some of the produce is placed in two different locations in the produce area. It's very clean and well-maintained. There is your usual wide variety of products spanning many Asian cultures as well as some western products too. Lots of live seafood too and a wide selection of meats, frozen foods, and snacks. Location is right by a very busy intersection so there is plenty of people in the area but parking is fine in their large plaza.; Nice and clean grand opening supermarket. Many on sales items are in very good price especially some fruits and vegetables. I got navel oranges $0.50 per lb that are super sweet. Also, frozen giant scallops on sales $9.99 per lb that usually $14.99 per lb. Good price 😄
Rice noodles 4 for $4.98 😉I got 8 for my friend.
However, no all items are cheap. Pay attention on the on sales items then you will really save money.; Newly opened in 2024, it took over the former Kmart location. The inside is huge with a huge variety of items. While prices are not as high as h-Mart, it seems to sell at a small premium vs other markets. Items on sale do make it worthwhile. Parking close will be difficult. The Chuze fitness next door also has many customers and both sets of customers are jockeying for the closest spots to their respective entrances.; Another Super Market just opened next to a bunch of others... yey...!

Visually, the market reminds me of Ralphs and Vons, but the the grocery items are almost the same as 168. There are also a few small stores in here. Mix it up together, and you get a small version of San Gabriel Super Store. They have volume thats for sure, I just hope the fruits aren't as bruised up the next time i come here. I wonder how long it will stay clean in here 🤔 Their basket have wheels so that's cool.

There's a small women's clothing store which is cool, but we seriously need ACTUAL RETAIL CLOTHING stores around here; not another super market next to another super market thats next to another super market 🙄 We already have Super A, 168, another asian market at san gabriel and another across The Hat, and Ralphs all within 3-4 miles. This is redundant like Subway. This store should've been a bunch of small stores like H&M, Zara and even Sephora. I really wanted this spot to be trendier.

They're using some brand of card swiper that I have never seen before, so I really need to research where it came from out of security."

It's always crowded with people from all parts of the world...mixing recipes and talking with each other. It's like visiting a

The fish moves so fast...it's always fresh and good. If you don't start with good ingredients...it's not going to get any better.
It's one of the only markets that carries fresh chicken feet (a great cooking stock).
The vegetables are ""prime""!
Real Jordan almonds...(colors and white) fill neatly arranged trays of delicacies.
Pinenuts...walnuts...almonds...cashews...you name it...they have it. Best nut and spice connection I've found in this whole region.
Fresh seasonal fruit greets you at the entry. Once they had a giant Jack Fruit they cut hunks for us to taste. Delisious! I saved the seeds to plant new trees. My first Jack Fruit experience...I fell in love.
It's such a pleasant experience to do that food chore.

The registers upon check out are out of date, some don't have the belts working to speed up the check out process Their parking is full of holes and there are many security guards there to assist you but they bunch up in one place and their directions are confusing. Needless to say, it is not friendly to handicapped customers because it is impossible for one to exit their car and walk in this place. A positive thing, is that they have good prices but at the cost of the consumer suffering through this disorganized maze! The owner needs to stop penny pinching and invest in some needed remodeling there.; Priceare high. Small parking area.; I love produce sections, nothing better than real food! But this disappointed.  So much produce covered in plastic 🤮 then they even add styrofoam to make it worse!  When I go for produce I now go to Selectos or elsewhere.  If this place changes and offers more food without packaging I'd shop here more."

For some reason they don't serve burritos but they do serve plates of food that you would find in a delicious burrito. That's probably my main beef with them no pun intended. Their produce is exceptional and it has a little bit more variety than the big box chain stores like Walmart and target. If you looking for Hispanic grocery goods this is your One stop shop; The store has always fresh products, cookies and meat products. It is relatively clean. The prices are relatively low compared to other major stores like Walmart or Target.  Just purchased some chili and onions.; Place is always clean and stocked up on fresh produce. Meat and dairy department are also very clean and stocked up. The only down fall is the self check out service had 3 cash and one credit card so we had to wait a while for the cash register.

I've been coming to this gas station since I was a kid, and it's still a familiar and comforting place. My dad has been a regular customer for years, buying beer every week. The owners are friendly and always greet us with a smile. The staff is helpful and always willing to assist. The drive-thru feature is incredibly convenient, especially on busy days. The car wash is top-notch, and I appreciate the vacuum feature for keeping my car clean. However, I've noticed that the air pump is frequently broken, which can be frustrating. Additionally, there's a group of men who often hang out in the back, which makes me feel a bit uneasy. Overall, this gas station is a reliable neighborhood spot, but there are a few areas where improvements could be made.; Pioneer Market is easy and convenient the drive-thru is very fast and the employees are very knowledgeable about the items they sell. They have almost everything you'll need for a quick stop. they also have a car wash and a vacuum center which makes it convenient for you. I go there quite often just because it's easier than getting out of my car and walking into a liquor store.; Go here nearly everyday, so convenient. Owner is a bit dour and once berated me for improperly washing my truck. While I won't use the car wash anymore, the store is great, and the people are nice.; STEALING!! HORRIBLE!!! the Spanish girl that works there has stolen from me two times in a row already. I reported it to the owner the first time, she still works there marking up items and pocketing the money. I will never shop there again. I do not recommend you go there. She is also stealing from the owner as well, by not scanning the items. she drives the white car.; This store is honestly amazing, they carry all the snacks and drinks I could possibly need. They also carry a wide variety of smoking related products. The customer service is great, they’re quick to grab your items, and are very attentive (drive through)."

I went there to buy a shadow the hedgehog action figure.  There was one left on the shelf.  But as soon as I was gonna grab.  An employee swipped it from my hands and ran off.  I chased them down.  But they quickly went into the employee lounge and locked themselves in.  When I told a manager about it.  They refused to help because ""It's just a toy, it's not important""  So now we have employees stealing stuff from peoples carts....GREAT!; Today (12/17/2021), around 2:00 -3:00 pm I needed help with a metal type shelf to place in the shopping cart.  Looked for assistance and asked 2 men's sitting in front of the painting supplies area. The one I had asked first for help first ignored me completely then giving me a serious look I apologized if he was a supplier said no but did not bothered to tell if they were on break or so.  So as I was about to turn  back feeling useless and ignored when then the other employee offer to help.  Again I had apologized and thanked to the 2nd  employee.
However I must confess that it did affected me emotionally and worst when I happen to be in disability.  I've tried to do my best with little aid but the shelf box exceeded my lift weight capability.
Really it would do greatly to train employees to be very cautious with disability, seniors even others who are needs from employees.
Sincerely
Sabina Bonilla; My preferred Walmart in Ponce, it seems alot less crowded than the other store, and I find more items from the US I was used to purchasing. I recycle my soft plastics here each time I go shopping. Very convienent. 🤗 Great Produce, Cheese, Dairy and Meat selections.

Not the cleanest,  not the safest,  but the employees are very nice and friendly.  I had an issue with the digital coupons, (I don't know why they have to make them so hard to get on your phone)[maybe they hope you don't use them] but Jocelyn (I'm sorry,  I think that was her name) was so kind and patient,  she took my phone and helped me get the coupon.  Anyway,  good experience. 👍; This is my favorite Ralph's to shop for my groceries, people are usually nice most of the time here, clerks are very nice and helpful, The meat  counter has a variety of meats, the butcher, bakery, everyone, every area you find in this store are here to make sure you make your shopping experience worth your time.; Somebody else I know and me have been coming to this particular Ralphs for the past twenty years with little complaint up until the last four or five years. For starters, I'd like to add that, last time I checked, most of the current employees have also been there for many years, and we have little complaint with them as well (Bertha in particular was a kind person): our issues isn't with the store or the employees, it's with the loiterers and some of the customers. For instance, we've been challenged to fights at least four times between us, one of the cases was with someone who appeared to be homeless, another case was with someone who appeared to just be released from being incarcerated (we believe he possibly may have had a weapon of some kind). In conclusion, we theorize that the bus/train station directly across the street is one reason for the excessive amount of low quality people."

Despite this, I was pleasantly surprised by the wide selection of fresh produce available. The fruits were very reasonably priced, and I was able to get everything I needed without breaking the bank. The only downside was that it was a bit crowded inside, but it wasn’t too difficult to navigate through the aisles. On the plus side, parking was easy to find, which made the trip much more convenient. Overall, a good place to shop for fresh produce at great prices!; Great vibes and environment for all ages.  Loved the live music by Raized Wrong!  A wonderful array of different offerings.  Clean Huntington Beach setting with that cool ocean breeze.; This is the best place for produce that I’ve found in the area. They usually have a wide variety to choose from, a lot of organic options, and way better prices than Ralph’s or Vons. Some of the produce is 3-4x cheaper here. The only downside is some produce may be a bit ripe and can go bad quickly (but this can happen anywhere). They often have less expensive egg and dairy options as well. I highly recommend!; I love this place. Their produce is the best in town. Prices are very reasonable.; Many fruit vegetables and plants and gardening equipment, the plaza is safe and the store has good prices."

Very friendly and helpful employees.; This supermarket surprised me with the level of fresh fruits and vegetables available. An assorted variety of imported and local products in a clean and comfy area. You can always find a helpful associate to answer your questions and then cut some of the legumes for you.
Unfortunately, I can not say the same for the meat department. The staff is rude and dismissive. The meat while fresh is packed poorly and bloody. Management should keep an eye on this important department.
The rest of the files are well-stocked and clean. Prices are competitive for the location.
And finally, the cashiers are friendly, courteous, and fast.; As with most supermarkets in the island they never have what I’m looking for but for PR (and Caguas) standards it’s a pretty good supermarket anyway. Their wine and beer selection is great tho!; Nice place very clean; Huge selection of quality products and some decent deals like a whole roasted chicken and a loaf of bread (pan de agua) for $11.00 (without taxes)! Clean, well lit and well stocked...first time in a while where all the shelves are full of merchandise. The fifth star is for the cashier who checked me out and packed my bags just because (first time in a long time that the cashier also packs my bags). Also a huge plus to shopping here are all the other stores, restaurants and the bank in its immediate vecinity."

Don't let the name fool you though; I was able to find serranos, jalapeños and habanero chiles including corn tortillas and flour tortillas. Also bacalao (cod); This place is fairly new.

The parking could use some work but so can every parking lot on the island.

The store was huge and fairly clean.  Things were laid out nicely and yhere were tons of staff.  Hope you know Sapnish though because most of them don't speak English and one guy was a little rude when I asked for help.  Another guy was very helpful though and went out of his way but still didnt find what I was looking for.

They have a large selection of wine to choose from and a food court with a bakery and sushi bar.

I'd go here again for basic shopping but if you need a bigger selection, hit up walmart or Sam's."

Price aren't cheaper and no association with Great Value brand.; Since Walmart sold Amigo to Pueblo, it has marked a huge differences with our budget. They have stopped also honoring the competion's better prices, even their own base company which is Pueblo Supermarket. We stopped going there because not only that, because they laid out their most valuable resources, the people who so graciously worked there once.; My mom loves the strawberry with chocolate; Located at Las Catalina's.

However, they have managed to cleverly arrange their items and displays in a logical way to maximize space. They have a deli counter, with prepared food also available in the area. They also have an area which I'll call the Sandwich Station with prepackaged deli meats & cheeses along with other items needed to make a sandwich. There is also a fresh meat counter with a nice display case. The produce department looks very neat and organized. This location has most of what you would expect at a Ralphs, albeit on a smaller scale.

After browsing the aisles I started to notice  that they don't carry everything other Ralphs stores carry, which makes sense. Being a smaller store they don't have the physical space. However, the overall selection of goods is pretty much the same as other locations, and they utilize their space well.

The store seems to be safe, and the parking lot is wide open without places for people to lurk around. I also like the fact that the entrance is free of people lurking about. This could be my new alternative Ralphs.; The issue with at least this location is on the right side of the store as you walk in.  Very cramped and almost claustrophobic.  Laid out very poorly.  The produce section is ok but the meat section is extremely sub par.  Small with few choices.  The two or three aisles on that side are also short, narrow and lacking.  The bread section is terrible.  I mean awful.  As you move to the other side the store opens up as does the selections.  Sushi counter,  The aisles spread out and lengthen and consequently your options grow with them.  I like Ralphs but whoever designed this location did a quite poor job of it.; Visit Ralphs 2 days ago to get some soda, dog food and some snaks for the New Year. It's not so busy during my visit since it's 8pm and everything went well as it is. Will be back for sure. Peace😀😎; Your usual modern supermarket with most everything you need. Good fruits & vegetables. Watch for markdown items just a couple days before their expiration date and remember that the expiration date is often just a guide for freshness. The one thing that's not as good as it used to be as there are fewer checkers and more self-checkout stands. I try to avoid the self-checkout stands because I feel like I'm depriving people of employment. Also why should I be doing the work that the store is supposed to be doing for me and that is ringing up my prices.; One of the attendants on the do it yourself checkout machine is a very honest person. I forgot my cash back but then the attendant called my attention while I exited the store. He handed me my cash back. I was very thankful of her honesty. God bless her."

Some of the best sauces I’ve ever bought on a trip! This is a must stop while visiting PR.; Are you interested in tea leaves, spices, sauces, or jams? If you heart said yes to any of those, then you should come to the delightful little Spicy Caribbee! You get a sampling station right when you enter, where you are greeted by a good variety of bottles of sauces and jars of jams, their own recipes. You can help yourself to knifes and sticks to sample them, and they even provided crackers and tortilla chips for a more contextual test. Go straight for their Green Heat and you'll never go back. Their guava jam is also possibly one of my all-time favorite types of jam now. For the spices, you will find a selection of their own blends, including ones that will give you a local Puerto Rican flavor in your own culinary adventures. My personal favorite is the tea section, where you can spend a long time meticulously smelling the different teas they have, including some very interesting blends. Spicy Caribbee is a way of life, and the helpful staff at the store is always ready to assist you on your journey.; Delicious spices, sauces, and teas!  They offer tastings of a number of their sauces so you know what you're getting.  Definitely try the banana ketchup!  It's a bit sweeter than regular ketchup, and I love it.  When you're in Old San Juan, definitely stop in and check this place out!; Gretta was so much help. Appreciated her  fluent English. This is a must stop at.

Good sales and discounts for military.; I was in the San Patricio Plaza store and I'll never go back as a customer I've been buying for 2 years and today I went to buy a smoothie and an energetic one for the gym, I took the usual smoothie and asked the cashier if she had something on offer in energetically and without much attention, she replied that no, that depends, I ask her if she had something similar to what I requested and she tells me NO.  I saw that there were several in the gondola, I was waiting for an alternative from her and she went to the back and left me alone and after a while another one arrives and asked me (are you going to pay and I tell her nooo if the other daughter is going to check something I forcefully pressured them and the other one told me WELL NO THERE IS NOTHING.... you know I released everything I had that there was almost $80.00 dollars and I released it and left. Now I don't fly and what I was looking for I got it in vitami word. Thanks for nothing. I will make sure that the gym companions that we sponsored that store do not come back

They also have a wide variety of vegan, peanut free, and organic products, so for people with allergies it's a great place to find your food fare. The workers are always friendly. I tend to shop in the later evenings to avoid the afternoon/early evening crowds.; Not the best prices. Econo has better prices. But it is a bit cleaner and better service than Econo; I like shopping at Amigo San Lorenzo. Close to home, no traffic and good prices. Always find what I need. Meats are good. Refrigerators are odorless and clean.; Amigo in San Lorenzo is good enough market.  It has all your necessities at semi-competitive prices.  They are owned by Walmart so if you are familiar with Walmart standards... this market does not reflect the Walmart standards.

It's small in comparison to its neighboring market, Econo.  They have a small produce selection and a very small butcher/deli section.  They offer whole roast chicken for almost half the size of Costco chicken and at almost twice the amount ($8.00)!

They have a very small Asian/International section and the products are overpriced.  In their defense the area is not heavily populated with Asians, so I don't blame them.  Some of the products are even covered in dust because no one really buys them in San Lorenzo.  If you want a larger ""Asian"" variety, go to the Walmart in Caguas or ask someone to ship you items from the states.

There are several check out counters which seem to usually always have someone working in each one.  The staff are friendly enough but sometimes when the lines get long, there is no sense of urgency it seems.

Parking is a nightmare, then again, parking and drivers in Puerto Rico is just one big nightmare.  I know that's harsh, but it's true.

Some side notes:
- Return line/customer service counter line is usually very long.
- They do sell lottery tickets.
- They have a redbox and a coinstar/coin to cash machine.
- Small butcher window by the roast chicken & Asian items.
- Small bakery to the left of the entrance.

It is the right choice for vegan, vegetarian, fish vegetarian and all kind of organic diets. Also they have a good lunchroom where you can have hot or cold  healthy food.

Boogie ambiance, which I feel affected their initial customer service towards us negatively.

Long line: the entrance is semi hidden as there's a gate to their private parking. Disclaimer: in all honesty, we showed up in hiking attire after having gone to Puente La Hamaca earlier in the day. On arrival we browsed for wines we knew, and noted that there wasn't anyone on the floor. Looking for help, we felt as though we were placed low on the priority list as we saw other customers being attended to. This of course changed when we came wanting to open two bottles on premises and a block of cheese, which is why I'm calling them boogie.

They have a very wide array of different wines from many countries in all continents with trained staff to help you pick the wine that suits your taste. It is a great place to spend the time as well. Cold cuts served in house too and have a good selection for whisky fanatics. Good for a early unwinding during the week as they close relatively early.; What a selection of good wines! The Bodega de Mendez is so much more then just a liquor shop - we have not yet found such a large selection of good and some extremely good wines, with emphasis on Spain, but also a comprehensive and high quality selection of France and US. There is a small but top notch selection of food like old Manchego cheese from Spain etc. available. A paradise for wine enthusiasts."

A friend who knows the insides told me that they actively avoid cross-contamination, and make their food separate, to the point that anyone can eat many things here.

So their quality is on point.

We had delivery via Lunchera for lunch. They took a bit of time (45-50 minutes) but this is fine considering the food is made fresh from scratch.

Portions are decent, but on the smaller side.

Everything tastes fresh and nutritional, and they're perfectly willing to make a custom order to fit your health needs.

Also, at one point they called us due to a price difference on their end, so they were honest and offered us something extra to compensate.
Truly extraordinary service and honesty.

Overall this is a wonderful place to visit normally, and a great restaurant for people who need a bit of extra care for their meals.
Truly, their food is the healthiest you'll find nearby.

Ten minutes later someone came, and she didn’t even acknowledge the wait/apologize. I could have done the grocery shopping myself in a thirty minute long wait? I don’t think they started shopping until I arrived. Very frustrating.; Cooper is by far the best cashier we have had, he interacted with our kids throughout the checkout and was very respectful.; Being harassed about parking from employees as a customer is uncalled for. I mentioned that I’m not parking here for class, I’m going inside, and I was still handed a flyer to “tell others not to park here.” They threaten to tow cars even though they can’t prove who is a student and who is not.; Good store, they have everything I needed.

Many interesting items that are hard to find.  Great selection of organic and vegan items. They have the fall/Halloween items out now,  so cute!; I like shopping at super 1. I live close by and shop their daily. The only issue I have is the skinny guy with the obvious comb over who generally works towards the back of the store. That guy literally followed me around the store the entire time. Obvious assuming I was going to steal. Why else would he blatantly follow me around the store? It was a very uncomfortable feeling. I almost stopped and asked if he had a problem. Never had an employee follow me around a store in my life. You will know exactly who I'm talking about once you see his terrible comb over. I'll just ask for a manager next time if it happens again; Clean and well organized store reminds me of Safeway with a larger selection of organic and a bit higher prices though not crazy.   A couple deals on chips and the meat section had some great looking (though pricey) steaks.   The cashier was super friendly.  Walla Walla is a little slower paced than Tru-Cities which is a welcome change and made for a more hometown feel.   Shopping cart was in good repair as it appeared so were the others.   If you are ok with Yokes prices  to enjoy a pleasant shopping experience this is a great choice.   If price is all you care about consider a lower quality grocer.; I really love shopping here. They have decent prices, and their health food options are almost endless. The staff are always so friendly and helpful. We went through Esli's checkout lane this evening, and she made the whole experience so fun and enjoyable for us and our son. I really appreciate the positivity and friendliness we are met with by all of the staff. Thank you, and we will definitely be shopping here more often.; My fiance and I love this store. We go out of our way to come here instead of Safeway however, a little bummed about how the new store manager is running things. We go there mainly for the employees and the employees aren't even allowed to take a sip of water at their checkout stations when customers are present which is just ridiculous. On a hot summer day and they are parched, they should be able to drink from their water bottles. I guarantee you that customers DON'T CARE.

The conversations we have with the employees make our evening and we care for their well being. Make sure to take care of your hard working employees who make your business run smoothly . We don't care about some products costing a little more than other nearby grocery stores when the workers genuinely care about us!! The night manager Shelby works her butt off and even helped my fiance when he locked his keys in his truck. Carlos and Rafael are extremely friendly and are always willing to help when we need it. And Heather thank you for making sure I always have my Reese's big cups in stock!! Your employees are our friends. There are several more employees that we love and just can't remember their names at the moment. Thank you everyone! We wouldn't go there every night if it weren't for you !!"

And they haven't opened the gym yet.  I can't imagine what the plug will be like to get out.  We ask that you please keep them open during the day.  I understand that at night for security reasons they do it but not in broad daylight when what you want is to buy quickly and leave.; Without any sense they close 2 of their 3 exits at 7pm which leaves us with only the exit that has a poorly synchronized or damaged traffic light that skips the green light up to 4 times in a row, this makes something as simple as leaving the mall a mission."

Why are we scanning bar codes on an app now anyway??? This is discrimination against the elderly, people who don't have phones or if your phone dies in the store or you just don't bring it.

There are plenty of seats inside and out and the facility stays relatively clean.  I enjoy visiting this Starbucks!; Love thier ❤️ Mango Dragonfruit Lemonade! It's so refreshing! 😋; awesome coffee and service but the drive through is a bit uncomfortable; It took them 35 minutes to make two frappuccinos that I order via uber eats, and I'm just indicating the preparation time.

Well organized.  Neat and clean location.  Amazing!; End of March so it food shopping for us.  Was able to find everything on my list.  Whoopee Sugar free Klondike ice cream sandwiches.
There have been  sad days for me at times as No NY strip steak, no sugar free caramel ice cream, no enticing steak or beef cuts, and NO SUGAR FREE GUAVA JAM.  Which is a sweet treat with waffles toasted in air fryer.
Today I found local meat cuts and the Sugar free Guava Jam.  AM HOOKED ON H2OH, zero sugar, 10 calories fizzy orange drink.  Great help for water sub.  I sometimes need lemon.  Grew up on coffee, Mom didn't push water.

Hooked so I return to places that always that satisfy me.  Yes, Pueblo was stocked.  I use to find everything including my treats: Sugar free chocolate for my nightly treat and YES ,my sugar free ice cream sandwiches.  Ahhhhh Breyers Salted Caramel Sugar Free.  The meats were varied and  local with some cuts from stateside.
Went shopping for a couple of items and IT WAS UNAVOIDABLE.....I found so much: the cuts of beef, great.
Today was as always.......all on my list plus the fruits that inspired me to make
My kind of light desserts.......Gala Apples for sauce with thin slices over sugar free vanilla bean ice cream, all plus more.
They had Tomahawk steaks!!!
I shop in Pueblo close to 3 times a month......that is proof of a satisfied customer.
Finally supermarkets has expanded their sugar free options but for me Pueblo despite economy is improving each day.

I understand the supply problem but my favorite supermarket is short on steaks,  lacking sugar free ice cream, sugar free yogurt and where is the H2OH!  My nutritionist has a can of H2OH as an example for her patients to see thanks to me.  I will be calling PepsiCo.  However my husband ran it a was able to get our fave coffee and toiletries.; Like this supermarket. It has all you need to cook and drink. Prices are good.

I hope they get to keep their doors open with their original name, Amigo 🇵🇷 I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 dumbs up 😍; I like this store as it is always very well stocked with the items most used by me. Their meat department has good variety of fresh and frozen products.

Amigo was bought by Pueblo so prices have change and they have done several changes to the store.; I have been shopping there for years and I am always amazed at how poorly they keep the shelves stocked. Do they not inventory stock and order so things don't run out? This I believe is a Walmart affiliate, why do they act so poorly in keeping merchandize on the shelves? I would fire whoever is in charge of ordering products for the store. There were no snack size cheese squares, nor the cheese sticks, there was no Good Value thin cut honey ham, there were no 13 gallon size garbage bags! Come on, I never leave this store spending less than $150 and it's usually closer to $200 and that's just getting one pack of chicken thighs. So please do a much better job at keeping the store well stocked!

I returned to Amigo a week later on 8/21st and found the same problem, many items were not available.
This time I asked a store employee what the problem was. I was told that this store will be closing by the end of August and a Pueblo supermarket will replace it! So if you frequent this supermarket til the end of August, be prepared for stock to be even more depleted."

ATM it's inside the store. Cash and Credits cards accepted; Very clean and open space.

I had an excellent shopping experience at Supermercado Econo in Humacao! The store is always clean and well-organized, making it easy to find everything I need. The selection of fresh produce is impressive, and the prices are very reasonable. The staff is friendly and always willing to help, which makes a big difference. I also appreciate the wide variety of local and international products. This has become my go-to grocery store. Highly recommended!; Great shop, never been to a store that has slot machines in it; Today was not a good day for me to go shopping at Econo Humacao. I became a Keren for the first time. I couldn't get cellphone service at all, is like someone was blocking my signal 😒. Then I call my sister because I couldn't her to my bank app so that I could transfer money into my card to pay for bags, I always buy 3$ worth of bags. I had to scrap on my change purse 👛  and I didn't even had enough. There was this employee bagging my things he put the water underneath the cart. There is no way I could lift that. He looked annoyed on my request to leave it till the end. I didn't like the way he was bagging my items. So I went to bagged them myself. I was absolutely shocked at the poor quality of the bags. A balloon is stronger than them bags. I can't deal with incompetence.  Thank God that the girls are so polite and patient; Favorite store.  Clean, well stocked,  attentive  employees.  Would give it 5 stars, but their app for online purchases is many times problematic and on sale items almost impossible to find.  Also, many items are overpriced. If prices go higher,, will have to go to other stores.  The roomy aisles makes navigating shopping carts easier.; It moved to a new location and the service is great, lines move quickly and the layout of the store is well thought out. I just wish they had a larger selection of produce similar to the Econo in Fajardo. Their deli counter is outstanding and the liquor section is well stocked."

I saw Turkish red pepper paste and tomato paste being sold here. As Armenians we're already very little in the world and we need to support each other as much as we can - and boycott Turkish/Azeri products/businesses. Again, my suggestion to Garo's Basturma: Please purchase from Armenian suppliers and businesses instead! There's so many delicious and high-quality Armenian tomato paste/red pepper paste brands.; Pricey, but yummy! Fresh meats always available and in my opinion, it's the best basterma deli around town! And remember to get the vacuum packed soujouk, it's the best in a George Foreman grill!; Best Cold cuts and the most friendly owner, order already marinated meats for bbq.; The only original basturma 👍

While they may not have everything you might find at a grocery store in Paso, my guess is they carry about 95% of what you need.

They carry a wide array of beef from ranch 1857, Harris ranch, and First Light wagu out of New Zealand and a couple of others.  Their chicken and pork are also really good and fresh.

Although it may not be as big as the others in the Edison area,  this place has an in-house bakery and ready-made food department. My favorite from the ready-made section is the steamed buns with pork and vegetables,  yum!; Oh yah, this place is nice. I'm not sure why but lately the produce looks bad everywhere else. The produce at the Asian Food Market all looked lovely, as well as the meat counter and fish dept. This place is pretty big and I was able to find everything I needed. Well definitely be going back for more groceries soon.; This is the largest Asian food store within 30 miles of me and I come up there for unique items for wok cooking or doing homemade curry and especially freshwater eel, which is frozen in the sauce and absolutely delicious if you’re into making your own sushi.

Sadly, much of this store carries Americanized versions of their products, I assume to try to get a larger community of people in the store. Finding various Asian country food written in native languages is harder every day as products are not, as varied as a decade to go in the same store.

There’s lots of boxes in the aisles and the Layout of the store is confusing, although it’s quite large and if you’re looking for basic items to make a dinner that you watched on YouTube or somewhere that store will likely have what you need. But there are many better places, and many cleaner places too.

They also have ducks and chickens hanging in a small corner of the store and currently in November 2023 they are going $35 for a duck cut up and packaged. The duck is excellent cooked beautifully, but the section of the store has changed over the years and they’ve made it smaller and smaller , with less products, both cooked in store and throughout the supermarket. The fresh live seafood section is gone although fresh meats and frozen food makes up for it.

It gets a three because the store shouldn’t have the feeling of a smaller big box store, prices are not cheaper and you have an Aldi’s experience."

I often come here when I can't find the items I am looking for at neighboring stores. A real community asset.; I shopped at this Shoprite for approximately 18 months. It usually was very busy in the middle of the afternoon, not as busy later on in the evening after 9pm. The manager special markdowns in front of the registers sometimes had reasonably priced small lunch options. The freshness wasn't 100% great on a few items I bought for a quick lunch. Reduced priced day old stuffed shells, or chicken & broccoli were passable for a quick lunch but obviously not the freshness of made that same day.; My mom is a very loyal price plus member and so when she has work or is unavailable I always do the grocery shopping. It was about 9-9:05 and I was ready to checkout so I went to self checkout since I didn’t have that much stuff. As I’m scanning a very aggressive and rude Indian employee I’m not sure what his name was is nagging me very rudely about how I have to put all the items in the bagging area now I had heavy waters and things in bulk so I very nicely said I’m not bagging anything and this stuff is heavy I’m a 20 year old woman and not a very strong one at that and he points and said “well this is what the store requires you to do” and did the same thing in the same tone to a very elderly woman with a case of water as well along with her other groceries and she didn’t sound happy either. He is staring me down and practically breathing down my neck so at this point I’m extremely uncomfortable. I finally scan and pay and re load up my entire cart I take my receipt to go home and step over and get lottery tickets before I leave and as I’m walking to leave he approaches me yet again and said I didn’t give him a Chance to put paid stickers on my stuff and he’s standing there sticking almost everything I bought and side eyeing the receipt in my hand. And stares at me as I walk out the store…now I’m sorry but what policies in the ShopRite union allow you to harass your customers and make young and elderly customers life loads and re load groceries back in the cart. He was extremely rude, disrespectful, and doesn’t understand personal space. He had no right and to my knowledge LEGALLY had no right to approach me after I left and paid to look at my receipt and basically prevent me from leaving the store. Absolutely the most unprofessional and rude behavior I have ever seen from an employee at any ShopRite. I should not have to feel uncomfortable and un safe simply paying for groceries….and about $100 by the way…i had a credit card and had every intention obviously to pay for my stuff he is not legally allowed to “detain” me and prevent me from leaving and letting me leave only after he side eyes my purchase receipt and sticks paid stickers on everything I bought. I don’t know his name but he was an older Indian man and was working self checkout line September 30 in the evening like I said around 9pm ish; Bakery is great! My guy Smbat will make any bakers wish come true.
Thank you for excellent service

The guys at the deli will take care of you better than any other grocery store James and Jake are great behind the counter; Although the store itself has everything you need, you simply cannot park there without a highest chance of getting your car hit by an unattended shopping cart.

Thanks Colleen for all the amazing cakes!! 🧁; I really want to like this place, competition is good. But, the meat is always spoiled, as is the fish. Some foods smell like cigarettes. Especially the aforementioned moist foods. It's just gross. Who is smoking in here? Who owns this place? Gnats flying in and around the sweets? Why is it so hard to not smoke in the back / store and get gnat traps. Why is it so hard to not buy too much stock, if you know the meat and fish won't sell?! I've read some of those comments praising the meat and fish at this location, no way! I'll give credit where it's due, though, the ""primo tallo"" fresh mozzarella and deli items are amazing. Please, save this place, clean house and start over.; Deli dude asked if I needed help with a mouthful of food. Cashier took all my produce out of plastic bags to scan even though I told her the price and sku number. First and last time I go to this place. 10 minutes to scan 7 items.; Clean, bright, good produce, lots of vegetarian options. The aisles are a little narrow, but not so much as to be a nuisance, like a Kings store is.; I haven't been in years because I got fed up with having to buy 10 of something to get a decent discount. Went today. Great prices, great service. Lot's of things on sale. Great seafood. Got lunchmeat..fruit..seafood
...bread. Very impressed. Will go back now that I don't have to buy 10 items. Good job Acme!"

I should have left my sandwich on the counter & walked out, but I was hungry & on my way to work, so I paid it. And the cheese tasted so cheap, and it didn't even melt, and it was a hot breakfast sandwich .

I’m glad to see that the owner/manager does read and respond to them.  However, I don’t believe that anyone has actually done anything about the issues brought up.
I don’t understand why no one in the store speaks any English at all.  Even the most basic words are not understood by the cashiers.  Also, they have not adopted the friendly attitude of the American sales representatives.
I’m from Hungary so I know how rude and unfriendly the cashiers were back there.
Yours are no different.  A smile and “Have a nice day” would be appreciated.
Last but not least, don’t assume I’m Russian.
This is after all, America.  Address me in English,please, or, at least answer me in English if I speak to you in English, unless you only want Russian customers.
The one star is for your good prices and your extensive and imported products, not found elsewhere. Kudos for that‼️
Thank you
A semi satisfied customer; Good selection of eastern european food (mostly russian, ukrainean), it was a nice surprise to find romanian cheese in there lol (Dobrogea goat&sheep cheese). The freshly prepared mushrooms salad is great (with mayonnaise and garlic); give it a try if you like mushrooms, u'll love it!

As for the prices.. It's a really expensive store, they import most of their products.. so I guess that makes sense. But still.. the price for Persil (laundry detergent) is outrageous, I've added some pictures.

I didn't like the atmosphere... It felt a bit awkward being in there. I forgot to get parsley and for some reason, when standing in line, the cashier kept starring at me (she was waiting for a ukrainian or russian guy to pay for his groceries). Our first cashier was nice and friendly though.. A young girl named Karina if I remember well

I don't think I'm gonna go back to this store during my stay in the US.
I came here searching for lovage which I couldn't find in the american grocery stores and to my big surprise they didn't have it, not even the dried one 😐; One of my favorite supermarket! Clean store with nice selection of western europe food items.Their variety of prepared food is incredible! Management and staff are always friendly and helpful. Especially manager Halyna is super nice! 5 Stars!; One of the biggest collections of food from ex USSR. The best cook in all Net Cost locations! Recently opened meat counter is a delightful addition with ready to cook marinated meats and chicken. Recommend all my Amercan Friends to visit.; Walked in with my mom went to the bathroom found her, some guy in a security vest was following me not speaking any English gesticulating he wanted to see under my shirt so as a joke I lifted my shirt and told him you know how I work out every day.

What I should've done is let him bring the police and expose him for the harassing dog he is. He has a mustache and beard I didn't take his name. My mom talked to him later on and he apparently conveyed some ""reason""

We liked to buy bulk borsec bottles from Romania a few hundred dollars worth of groceries every week. We might need to find some new supermarkets."

Why add vinegar, oil and rosemary to minced meat??? The question is rather rhetorical. For me, this is an indicator of the attitude towards the buyer.

Their prepared foods and produce are very good.  Cheeses and deserts are also very tasty, but prices have been flying high.  Some items are more expensive than whole foods, and that's saying a lot.  I like to support the local establishments as much as possible, however,  so it is what it is.; Since I moved to Manalapan a few years ago I’ve always bought meat from ShopRite but it always went bad even in one day. So I started buying meat amongst other items from Livoti’s and It is absolutely the freshest meat and it is not expensive at all.If it was a little higher than other places at least it’s fresh plus I’d rather spend a few more dollars and have great meat. Store is so clean and organized. The people are so nice and helpful. I will always shop here. You won’t ever be disappointed shopping here.; Mostly good stuff, but prices have gone sky-high since 2020.  No, it's not ""inflation.""  That's what we thought about McDonald's, too, before we found out they were making record profits. Went into the store today to get some pesto sauce. Small container was, get this, $14.99.  I'm sorry, is there a pine nuts shortage? Please explain why Italian bread is $4.  Wraps/paninis all a couple of dollars more expensive.   I walked out. I go there far less often now because they have gotten out of control with their prices. They can charge what they like - and I can choose not to pay it.; I love the staff behind the deli counter because they work quickly and efficiently even when the store is very busy. I also love the fact that they have gluten free meal options and tons of gluten free items throughout the store. Vegetables are always super fresh and less expensive than the grocery store. One star off because the last few times I picked up fruit it went moldy very quickly. Im also appalled at how expensive their gluten free bakery options are. It’s $16 for just a few gluten free Italian cookies. Pastosa has much more affordable gluten free bakery options.  All in all I’d absolutely recommend this store save for the fruit mishaps.; ***Store is filthy…Kitchen has flies all over the prepared food! And Cut fruit***Dirty mexican behind the fresh mozzarella section doesnt use gloves when making fresh cheese!*** Do not shop here!***"

My son came in from Out of town and loves a specific creamer that he can’t get on the West Coast & it’s always available here.  Unfortunately , it was nowhere to be found.  I spoke with Manny at Customer Service, he advised a truck just came in, not unloaded yet, but he will contact,  once the item is located. Low & Behold… a couple of hours later… Manny called, making us very Happy Customers … Food Emporiun is a fabulous store with excellent employees.  My Big Shout-out  to Manny… Your smile is infectious.  Thank You; Just went to see this supermarket.  A friend told me the meats were good here. Looked up and down the aisles they have most of the stuff I would normally buy and more. I wound up just picking up a few things since we just went shopping a day before. Was impressed by most of the stuff. Bought an Italian roll and a jar of their marinara sauce. The Stromboli roll and the sauce were good. Will be returning next time I need to go shopping.; I absolutely love shopping at this local supermarket! Not only is the store conveniently located, but the staff is always friendly and helpful. And it’s family owned and operated. The selection of products is fantastic, and I can always find everything I need for my weekly grocery shopping. The prices are also very competitive, and I appreciate the weekly specials and discounts that help me save money. Overall, I highly recommend this supermarket to anyone looking for a great shopping experience.
FYI. They have  monthly money savings coupons in the Route 9 Shopper; What a wonderful find!!! Great selection of fresh fruit, vegetables,  bakery items. Staff very friendly & helpful.  Heirloom tomatoes very reasonable, fresh basil too. Lots to see. I'll be a regular customer. So glad I found this hidden gem."

In my opinion it is much better to order by cell phone and pick up when it is ready (in the same way they will call your number) since there are no other businesses nearby and you will have to wait in front of it inside your car or sitting in a space that they have in the house where they have chairs so they can eat there.

Self-check out only 20 items of less. Cool for one or two stations but all of them it's ridiculous specially since you have an employee standing there wasting their time but only one or two registers open. I will never step foot in this store again. The employees are the worst I've seen in many years!!; This store is large with lots of variety of items. The produce and vegetables are always fresh. Nice selection of prepared hot and cold foods. Prices are fair and a lot of the weekly sale items at excellent prices.; This is not a good store. It's littered with miserable employees who are rude as hell. I go to the hot food bar and basically get ignored, then when finally someone says can I help you? I go to pay and the register is closed. So I go to the front and there's a huge waiting line at self check out everytime. Total joke.; I wouldn't normally write a review, but my experience with ShopRite in Long Branch, NJ's management was so bad that I felt compelled to share. While most employees were helpful and friendly, interactions with upper-level staff and management were incredibly disappointing. My expectations aren't high, but I've never been treated so poorly in a retail setting. It's unfortunate that the actions of a few overshadowed the positive efforts of the rest of the team.; BY FAR the WORST ShopRite I have ever been to

SERVICE - the customer service here is atrocious. They have less lanes open because of the self checkout lanes which would be fine if they didn’t close 8 out of 12 of the registers. They leave 3-4 self checkout lanes open with one slow employee to cover them. All of those things wouldn’t be as bad if you didn’t walk around the store and pass an excessive amount of employees standing around chatting. In addition to all of that they are just rude and not helpful.

STOCK - Items are frequently out of stock on a higher basis then other stores. this store definitely has less options than other locations.

The freshness of produce is also not good many times.

LOCATION - the parking here is not good at all. Not enough parking for all the businesses in the lot. The lanes are extra small so it’s always very tight."

She even said that she told him what had happened the last time and thanked him for being so patient and kind and for making her feel comfortable to return.

Get the famous Picanha cut and cooked right (check out YouTube) it is fantastic.   Highly recommend; Studies show the Amazon will be gone in under 60 years. Brazilian beef is the #1 culprit. But this place sources from US beef distributors only. So it's not so bad. But still... try to eat less beef. It will drive down the price and demand of Brazilian beef imports.; Stop reading this review and get in your car and go there!!! This place in unlike most other places. Brazilian Meat Boutique is by far the best Brazilian grocery store in long branch. Great prices, amazing staff that is very knowledgeable about Brazilian cuisine and the products they sell and quality food and Brazilian goodies. The meats have that Brazilian touch on them in terms of cuts and available seasonings. I always look at how clean a place is where I shop for food and wow, this place is super clean.

Head there for yourself, you’ll feel and experience a taste of brazil in NJ.; Open now during coronavirus season, shelves are fully stocked with various specialty foods. Staff is very nice they speak English, Spanish  and Portuguese. Store is very clean and product prices are decent. Meat is also top quality."

Waited around several minutes for staff this morning (who were nowhere to be found and another customer had to go look for other staff to page them) to verify a thermos only for the woman to outright ignore me and proceed to chat with and help customers who walked up after she'd arrived.

What a shame what Quickchek has become.; The tiny wrap ever from all the quick check the I stop by. The cashier nig guy👎; Nice. Clean. Great service. Has is cheap 2.41 today. 2.59 in other places.; Worst QuickChek I’ve ever been to. Every person has a bad attitude and never want to work. You sit by the counter for 6-7 minutes before someone strolls out of the back to give you assistance and then when they’re helping you they’re throwing things around, being rude, don’t want to help and make it like you’ve never been there before. I’ve been going to this quickchek for years and I’ve never been this dissatisfied. Terrible treatment to their customers. This place should be ashamed of themselves. Reevaluate who you hire."

This place was going downhill for awhile and they have definitely improved.  I shop here all the time.; Used to be great place, now awful. Strongly advise against joining here. there are other options in the area that are considerably better options now. This is coming from a 20+ year member who was shoved by a staff member for not checking out in the order he deemed fit. Management did nothing. Customer service in corporate has done nothing.

I have shopped here weekly since the 90's, used to bring my kids in their infant carriers. I would venture to say 50% of the meals my family has eaten in the last 25 years are from here and I have not stepped foot back in there in over 2 months. That's how long corporate customer service has been telling me to be patient and wait for a call, resolution, or to even address the problem.

Think twice before spending your money here, especially with multiple other warehouse options and plenty of grocery stores close by.; Store is located on a major North/South road. There is a few handicapped parking spaces and the store itself is handicapped accessible. The store was clean and well maintained. The shelves were well stocked. Most of the aisles are wide. They have a deli, a vision center and an area where you can purchase tires for your vehicle and have them installed. They sell a very large selection of merchandise.; My experience at this location was very poor. I don't think I have ever experienced a place where the employees are just visibly miserable. Everyone I encountered had an attitude and was just plain rude. Not a smile to spare. If I could give a more negative rating I would. Like -5.; I been always  buying from Costco but my mother in law asked me to go to BJs because of prices being better. Let me tell you something that happened on my first visit. I brought my aunt who is just moving to NJ, she is starting a new life here, got an apartment, bought tv on Saturday and cable company came on Monday to install services and when opened tv box, tv was broken. Today, Friday on her day off we went to the store to return it since it was damaged and manager is telling me tv and box have two different serial numbers. How did this happen? No, we didn’t switch tvs. First time we buy a tv this size and brand, this person is just moving here and bought a tv with first paycheck and now we are not able to return it! we are 100% sure that the broken tv with a different serial number was put inside that box by someone else! Not us, how do we prove it? Manager didn’t help at all to look for other ways to find out what exactly happened here, there has to be a tracking number to see who else returned same tv before us and exchange new tv to a broken one. Now we are stuck with a broken tv that we paid for and won’t get an exchange or our money back, what kind of business is this? My recommendation is go to Costco who is a 100% satisfaction guarantee, somewhere else or open anything you buy from this place before heading home so the same thing doesn’t happen to you. Be aware!

The sausages are great, however none of the vegetables have an expiration date on the jar and the yellow peppers are completely rotten, disintegrated. I contacted the customer service 2 weeks ago but didn’t get any reply.; I bought several times from this company and was always very satisfied and happy with their products. But now they are obviously starting to cheat on their customers. I recently (03/17/2023) bought (again) wieners, app. 1 lb for $11.99. I bought two lb. What I received were two 0.6 lb packages. Clearly not what I ordered. I e-mailed customer service, my e-mail was acknowledged as being successfully sent, but no response. Will never buy again from Fabko.; I have to say I am most impressed with Fabko. I placed a large order with perishable items and everything arrived in a timely manner, all items as described, and the perishable items came separately with coolant. Fabko even emailed me, letting me know my perishable items would be shipped on a Monday instead of a Friday to avoid sitting in a warehouse over a weekend. All items were packed very well and despite ordering over 10 different jars of goodies, nothing was broken during transit. I would highly recommend Fabko for all your European item shopping needs. I will definitely be returning!; My order came in fast. The items were packed very carefully and safely without unnecessary packing materials. There was a mistake but they replied to my email quickly and corrected the mistake right away. The items were close to expiration date but not expired. Did not concern me since expiration date on canned goods  does not mean the food is bad. I placed my order a while back,  still have some food in my fridge and it is totally fine.; I take great pleasure in shopping at Fabko. The store offers a good selection of European groceries, and I'm able to find there everything that I need; from delectable groceries to basic household items. The shipping is fast, perishable foods arrive in an insulated box with dry ice, everything is fresh.
The owner is honest and polite, he answers all questions promptly and courteously.
I highly recommend the store."

Which is great! This Wawa on the other hand does a very poor job reflecting the company I have ordered food twice through door dash and twice now it has come out wrong and mixed up with multiple orders. I have driven myself there to have the order made correctly. It’s unfortunate cause the food is great but is seldom made correctly. I’m unsure why this is a reoccurring issue and I’ve checked my receipt to make sure I put the order in right. Beware ordering delivery from here if you want the right food and not have to drive all the way there; Horrible! I was treated as if I was a burden to them. Also I asked for help with a certain product and I was told they were too busy with lunch and lied to me about the product being in stock so she wouldn't have to help. What?! Also a smile would really help with the stores vibe. At least acknowledge your customers when they speak to you. Smh!! Too many Wawas for that kind of treatment.; Wawa is great for a quick snack, coffee or shakes. When you are on a large trip, Wawa is always great for as a pit stop, the rest rooms are pretty clean.

*Decent parking space.
*Unfortunately, they don’t have gasoline here.; Wawa is always consistent. It doesn't matter which one I go to, I know the food will be the same good quality, service good and prices fair.; Place has definitely gone down over the past months. Young White lady with blonde hair at the drink making section was completely rude. I asked if my drink would be ready yet (I waited 30 mins) she spoke to me as if I was STUPID!!  Very condescending.

Walked in, as we waited in line, the person behind us in line jumped in and ordered in front of us, instead of the workers telling him to please wait for his turn, they just skipped us unapologetically. Waited 35 minutes for 2 egg/ham/toast breakfast. They forgot we had ordered waters too although we were charged for it. They put milk on my coffee even though I specifically asked for black coffee, and last but not least when we were sitting down to eat the paper they used to wrap our food in is not proper for foods. The ink/dye leaked on our food and obviously we couldn’t eat it. See photos — no it’s not sauce! It’s dye :/; This is the second time we came here and both times we were very disappointed in the service and food quality. I was very excited to have a nice dinner place at the Marina open, but unfortunately the quality of service is subpar.
We got seater at 9pm last night and ordered a bottle of wine, the cheese plate and some calamari to start. Everything started well and we were enjoying ourselves. 20 minutes later they brought the calamari which were just rubber. We were hungry so my husband ate them. I couldn’t chew through them. Anyways, at 9.45 they finally bring the cheese plate. The pita is raw, like pale white and the dough is raw. No one to mention this to, since the server brought the bottle of wine no one has approached us, not to pour wine, not to check on the table, not to take our main course order. The $35 cheese plate consists of 3 cheeses, olives, olive tapenade and the pita bread. Since our pita was raw and we weren’t interested in eating raw flour we just ate the hard cheese. A buser came and took the plate away, and we mentioned the pita situation. She said sorry and left. Our server finally came to tell us the kitchen is closing, we ordered the NY strip and the churrasco, both with tostones de pana and a side of truffle fries to share. 15 min later someone came and dropped my husband’s order in front of me. The fries were as a side on his plate. Please note that the cutlery and appetizer plates were just put in front of my husband and I wasn’t given a fork. Another 10 minutes later they brought my steak. Cold. With a blob of butter on it. The steak was cold enough that the butter didn’t melt when spread. Just cold butter on a cold steak.
The server also told us that she mentioned to the “chef” the pita was raw and the “chef” said it was in fact ok. She mentioned she doesn’t want to argue with the “Chef” because he’s her husband. Umm, ok?!
We got our bill, paid $160 including a 15% tip. We usually tip at least 20%, but honestly this was a case where no tip was deserved, if anything, an apology from their management is in order.
We won’t come back and don’t recommend it to anyone.
It’s a shame because it’s so nice to sit outside, the music is nice, location is perfect and their wine list is really nice.
They need some serious training on  service etiquette for their staff.; Place is “ok” for last minute things. A lot of áreas of improvement. Good prices and location is convenient if you’re already at the marina there’s no need to go out to the grocery.; Walked in knowing what I wanted to order. Sat for well over 25 minutes waiting to order anything. Watched every foh staff person take orders from different people who walked up or sat down after us without anyone acknowledging us or asking if we needed help/anything. Finally, one person came up, looked at me, and asked "" do you need anything?"" I said ""do you have"" and he walked away to help someone else. Made eye contact w/several staff, motioned for attention got the nod and still was ignored as they served another newer customer. There were at least 5 foh staff & maybe 15 tables. 👎🏼👎🏼
2 stars b/c some of the meat cuts are reasonably priced for being at a marina. When we previously visited during weekdays & were the only 2 ppl in the store we were able to get service.... after personal conversation was finished, not when we came to the counter.; I only had  pizza and it was good and the service waa great."

Perfect for buying Korean ingredients that you can’t find at other Asian supermarkets in the area. The meat section is perfect for buying your favorite cut and cooking Korean BBQ at home. They have great produce and fresh vegetables to choose from. Compared to American grocery stores, the prices here are a lot cheaper and they always seem to have new items in season. However, certain sections of the store are lacking and could use a better selection. There are also some items that we were looking for like boba pearls and they didn’t seem to have them which was disappointing.

The place overall is pretty small, but they have a lot of other small shops and a small food court inside as well. You can tell that it’s an authentic Asian supermarket because it’s not super clean. ^_^ It’s located in a large plaza with other shops and a popular coffee shop so there are plenty of parking spots.

Highly recommend!; First time here and impressed with the atmosphere and vibe of the place. The food was all delicious. Got the omelets and chicken wings and ube latte. Everything was really tasty. Prices are a bit high but nothing out of the ordinary for these times. Definitely would recommend if you like brunch places.; My friend lives in Garden Grove and she told me that actually A.R. Supermarket is her favorite for getting Korean food and products.

That’s interesting because I was often shopping Korean food in H Mart nearby but never noticed this A.R. Supermarket so I went to check it out.

It offers a wide variety of products at prices significantly lower than the H Mart’s!!

Vegetables, fruits, and mushrooms are very fresh, with organic brands too. There’s also a wide selection of side dishes, meat, seafood, frozen food, sauces, snacks, instant noodles, shampoos and etc. Those items are often on sale. For example, Harim’s frozen ginseng chicken soup was $7.7 (dated 5/2024) on sale while it was priced at $9.9 on Weee even after a discount.

The store layout is okay, but the lighting isn’t as bright as H Mart’s, so it might seem not so modern, however, I don’t mind as long as it provides good products with great price.

There are a few shops aside in supermarket including shoes shop, Korean cosmetic chain store, women clothing stores and hair accessory shop.  Overall, it’s a great place to shop at one stop and I definitely recommend it.

They also have a Fullerton location 📍 1701 Orangethorpe Ave, Fullerton, CA 92833; Great place for getting all the things we need for Korean BBQ; This is an nice foreign shopping experience without leaving town. I had to teturn the mosquito coils I bought here on sale for $4 because they were $2.50 right next door. They only offered me store credit, no refund.  I was ok with that, but used it up right away because the credit was issued on a simple hand written note."

So just look out for the tire place Gomera Edwin.; The outside is very comfortable and you can go out easily, the interiors are quite comfortable and you can easily find food.

And the staff looks at you seriously and the girl who served us today didn't even say good afternoon to us.

I recommend it 100%.👏👏👍👍; This supermarket is excellent over time because it is close to my house but its prices are very high, it should compete with Walmart's cone and prices and it could be fuller than people visit it in the service the staff helps a lot customer but whatever the price is very high success; My comfortable and very good service."

My favorite sections here are the fresh produce, agua frescas, and the bakery!

Beautiful hand painted pottery for serving and for gifts. Fresh butchered meats, seafood, cheeses. Diverse frozen foods department. Large aisles.; To Whom It May Concern,

As a loyal customer of over many years, dating back to when this location was Top Value store, I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration with the service I have received at the Northgate Market meat department. Despite my initial excitement about the store's renovations, my recent experiences have left me feeling fed up.

Specifically, I have encountered three employees in the meat department who seem to lack supervision, appearing tired, stressed, and displaying friction among themselves. I would like to bring the following issues to your attention:

Employees are not wearing name badges, making it difficult to identify them.
- A male employee, wearing a face mask and having multiple tattoos, consistently displays a bad temper, yelling numbers, and ignoring customers' questions. He also throws packaged meat on the counter, showing a lack of customer service skills.

As a manager myself, I would address these issues urgently. I have noticed some improvements, such as meat rotation and presentation during the grand opening, but these efforts seem to wane in the late afternoons, with some meat appearing stale and dry.

As a bulk meat purchaser, I spend significant amounts of money at this store, but I can no longer continue to stress and deal with the same employees without seeing changes after multiple complaints. I hope this feedback helps ownership become aware of these issues and take necessary actions before losing loyal customers like myself.

Im not giving one star as my review since I have had great experience with the cashiers and had a great experience with a gentleman from the deli department. He was very informative and helpful while I was trying to decide what to purchase.

Thank you; My place to go when I need real Mexican and Latino food products.  They have a tortilla factory in the store and you can always find super fresh corn and flour tortillas for sale.  They also have a good butcher counter with reasonable prices.  Their produce department offers run of the mill products as well as some of the more exotic produce that may be hard to find at your local Ralphs.  Their deli also has prepared food.  My favorite is their tamales that come in lots of flavors. There is plenty of parking in a large lot.  They; Northgate Market is the best if you want Mexican food, produce and things you will not get elsewhere. They also have everything else you would get at any good market.

The place is just spotless. They are always cleaning and it shows. The produce is amazing and they have a selection of peppers you simply won't find at a typical market.

They have a large section of hot food. You can get it there and just leave or continue shopping. The selection is really amazing and the prices are low. They have the best tamales and their rice and beans are so great. They have a lot of hot items and sometimes there is a line, but it moves fast. You will be happy with everything.

As to the main market area they have good prices on things you would want to get at a regular market and a vast selection of Spanish and Mexican items, be they canned or fresh.

It is easy to park in their large lot.

This store features a wide variety of grocery items and produce at unbeatable prices. In fact, the prices at this store, especially when it comes to produce, are rare to find anywhere else in the area. Some of their produce may not be very fresh sometimes though. It's important to choose a good time to visit the store, as it can get very crowded sometimes, specially Sunday afternoon.

The tamale station (both hot and cold) is phenomenal. The strawberry tamales are on point!

The chicken was delicious  our daughter ate it happily! There's so many things that our city needed that el super and Santa Fe don't do right.

The only recommendation is to split the areas for ordering food. We had a person behind us waiting to order a whole chicken, but splitting the Cocina and tortileria line into two would add way more customer satisfaction! Glad the old Kmart building has some use finally!!; Store is clean, vibrant, fresh and has an open airy feel to it. Meats and produce look clean and fresh. Oh yeah, and they have a in house tortilla factory 👍; Verdict: store has wide variety of Latin and Mexican products at regular prices and hot food options are ok. However, employees, specially security need to be educated on ADA laws.

Full review:
The security employees need to be educated on federal and state ADA laws regarding service and support animals. It is illegal to request for documentation to proof animal service registration. Employees are only allowed to ask whether a dog is service animal and what kind of service it provides. Also, ADA laws does not require dogs to wear a special harness and much less to have the dog on arms at all times. The employees admitted they didn't know the laws, but still demanded to get out.

Regarding to the store products and service only:
The store is well stocked and has pretty much anything you may need to make most mexican dishes. The food court items are varies. The carnitas are specially good. People behind the counters are polite.; Great prices and great variety of produce and meats (competitive pricing and wide range of poultry, beef, pork etc), all types of chorizo too 😏. the kitchen, bakery and tortillería are a great plus. Their tequila selection was pretty good I even got their last bottle of don ramon (havent seen this one in ages) and they even threw in a glass of the goat ochoa 🤣🙏  aint pullin up to overpriced ahh santa fe no more; The store is amazing, clean, organized, lovely. My only issue is the self-checkouts because it weighs the items or it will lock the screen and it locked me several times even though I placed each item as instructed and made sure my child didn’t pick up anything until the cashier just got mad and yelled at me. Lol 😂 im mad too dumb machine. Get rid of that. I ain’t stealing cilantro and tomatoes. Lol"

My regards to the staff I love you guys; I visited the store to buy  Tortas.; I go there a lot but sometimes it can be expensive.

I worked there for a while and the owner held my check against me and blocked direct deposit so cashing my check was hard for me too. Whenever customers needed a manager they will take forever to come to the front. One of the managers Brianda gave my sister attitude when I asked her if she can pick up my last check and disrespectfully told her no. One of the workers stole my lunch and the whole store in general is so unprofessional and unorganized.
Would not recommend coming here. They need to do better; One of the things I miss most about CA, besides family and the weather, is Grocery Outlet! Love the variety of organic foods and products, at bargain prices! Between chips, coffee, ice cream, chocolate, and fruit, there are always some great finds here. They also have a robust beer and wine section. When can we get one in South Carolina?!; Lots of deals, good prices. Always fun to see what new products are on sale. Paid $51 for all this stuff (including the lucky bamboo) with a savings of $31. Very pleased.; Do NOT buy cat food here.  If it isn't already expired,  then it will be very soon.  My cats won't eat the same foods, bought from Grocery Outlet, that eat all the time from other stores."

He’s always working and available to help you at any time. If I have to criticize anything I would say that there are way too many store brand products.

That being said, this is not tailored for the average shopper, pricing and some of the products are above normal partially because this is not a big chain store and they're buying volume is smaller and that tends to drive prices up. Also, the clientele are people who live up Old Santa Fe trail which tend to be higher income.; Outstanding local market that has been on location for decades.  For a small store there are plenty of grocery and prepared items.  Several good vegetarian options.  Prices are on the high side, but they offer high end options.  There is an outdoor covered location, with tables and chairs for eating on location.  Good on-site parking.; Fabulous local grocery store! Great wine selection! Terrific butcher! And their salad bar is legendary! So glad that Santa Fe has an independent, local grocery store close to downtown!; We purchased chicken thighs and grilled them.

The store is well-stocked with a wide variety of products, making it easy to find everything I needed in one place. The layout is convenient, and the aisles are clean and organized.

The staff were friendly and helpful, readily available to answer any questions I had and assist me with locating items. The checkout process was efficient, and I didn't have to wait long in line.

The only reason I’m not giving a full 5 stars is because the parking lot can get quite crowded, especially during peak hours, making it a bit challenging to find a spot. However, overall, it's a great place to shop with a good selection and helpful service. I'll definitely be returning for my future shopping needs!; Very, very busy. Pretty good selection of products.  Enjoyed Panda Express.  Also, contrary to most places in Puerto Rico, the bathrooms were well maintained. The vendors outside had great ice cream and icees.; It’s hard for me to get that upset to write a review of any kind. But I grew up going to Walmart and I always left my shopping cart alone for a very long time. But the day I went recently I was rushing out of respect that the store was closing soon. So since I have a debilitating disability. I was in pain and could not push my heavy cart but I left it no more than 5 minutes. When I come back my shopping cart magically dissapears and they cannot find my shopping cart they took recently. This whole ordeal was disappointing especially when the staff could care less about my children’s food and my hard work to fill that shopping cart ( Disabled people are not welcomed); I love going to this Walmart because they have a variety of items. Plus the isles are not cluttered.; The Humacao Walmart is located in a mall that doesn't have control of the parking and the accessibility of the customer.
After opened the Home Depot across the street we stopped going to Walmart as you never know if you can get out later.
The location isn't convenient... better at Econo.."

No parking lot since REI took over the Trader Joe's parking lot. There is not enough room for the amount of customers. Trader Joe's needs to figure it out and make more space for customers. Marina del Rey has a million people and Trader Joe's has half of parking blocked for boater's parking only. There are so many of those parking spaces left empty.

Mostly fees and a tip. Don’t mind the tip because the driver did their part. Called store back to discuss and they basically don’t give a &$@* if ever order again or not. I guess I’m like everyone else and don’t like getting ripped off.; Yummy used to be in Santa Monica. I was so sad to see them leave. They delivered groceries before it became popular. Fortunately, this location delivers to Santa Monica. They have most household items and a good selection of groceries. The deli has some of the best sandwiches. My favorite is the victory garden. The price is a bit higher than some other grocers, but it's worth it.; Love Yummy. Most reliable groceries during the pandemic.

I bought freezer burned breakfast sausage a few weeks ago and tonight I bought room temp blue cheese dressing from the produce section that had a broken seal. This place is a joke. The neighborhood needs a good market but this place isn't it. Either care about your neighbors and customers or sell it to someone who will.; Careful. They intentionally hide prices.

Also the food bar, juice bar, deli section, etc are always of high quality as well. Great for organic and plant-based shoppers!; Way overpriced for exact same items elsewhere. Usually leave annoyed with the store. Their ""sale prices"" usually bring things to regular prices.

Example: Orgain Simple vegan protein powder vanilla (15 servings) is 23$ and target and amazon, etc.

It is 42$ at this Bristol.

FORTY TWO.

And they won't price match when asked.

Insane price difference and there's plenty of similar scenarios all over the store. With as high of prices at this location, you'd expect some stellar customer service. Sadly, it's usually a sour mood employee, or the security guard making you feel unwelcome.

This place survives off LMU community, they'd by sunk otherwise.; We ordered a grilled turkey sandwich and took it to go. The bread was a bit  crispy on the outside. The turkey, cheese and Avocado was about 1.5 inches thick. Everything was fresh and tasty. We split the sandwich and 1/2 was enough for one person.

We stop by whenever we visit LMU.  Very clean store with tons of buying options. The fresh food pre-made cold and hot section will have you spending time trying to decide what will be the best choice for that day.

About $5-15 per person."

And there is no way for me to scan them. So I have to go to the register, and the cashier rings the item up, and then I say, “gee, that’s too expensive” and I put it back and I try to find another item. It’s such a waste of time!

And the people at the cash register are downright grumpy. Another review noted that as well. It’s not my fault that they don’t have prices on their items. The people, without exception, were grumpy. Every…time…I went in, which was dozens of times.

Lastly, the produce section is quite limited. Not one single avocado.

I will say they have an excellent wine selection and an excellent “wine cave” in the back. But I will save my dollars for the other stores on the island where the prices are marked and the cashiers are friendlier.; Of the three we have shopped on Vieques so far, they are a solid second. Good selection of canned/shelf-stable foods including Kirkland brand (Costco) dry goods and surprising refrigerated ravioli, a cheese tray, and lots ice cream. They had a good selection of cleaning products, but nothing to wash dishes with-such as a sponge or dish towel. The fresh produce was sparse and what was available did not appear to be very fresh, although they did have good looking shallots and onions, which I bought.; They were open late, had everything we needed, and is located on a great strip of other stores close to sea glass beach.; This store does Not Have Prices on 90% of their food!

They Do Not follow the law and provide a scanner!

I saw two labels on the shelf for mozzarella cheese yesterday. One ""Kraft Mozzarella"" for $3.99 and the other ""Three Cheese"" for $7.99.

I decided on the $3.99.

At the register. SHE RANG THE CHEESE LAST for $7.99.  I  said, ""The shelf lable says $3.99"". Indignantly, she says, ""Show me.""

We walked back, I pointed to the table, and she said, ""it's the wrong sku."" OK, so how long has it been since they sold Kraft for $3.99?

Why would they leave it up? Most people would not pay attention, but I am on a fixed budget, and I don't get free food.

She says, ""it's $7.99, you want it or not?""

The manager or owner was upfront, so I went to him and went over the same thing.  His attitude was the same, and he actually tried to blame me for being the problem.

I explained that the law says he's to have a scanner, and I have asked him on other occasions for prices of food that's not priced.

I asked before, and they laughed.

They don't care about the person buying food. They have a 'Take It or Leave It' attitude with a rude sense of customer appreciation.

There is no telling how many items are outrageously priced, and we have to pay regardless... because they know they Got You!

There was never an ""I am sorry, or We made a mistake,  only, That's the Price, You Want It or Not""?

The girl finally rung it up at $2.99. But after being treated like I was, it was not for me, I  didn't want to buy anything from them again!

Be Aware!
Nearly No Prices!
Wrong Lables!
Piss Poor Customer Care!

I'll go Elsewhere From Now On!; Best selection on the island for meats and fruits/vegetables in-store, but a bit expensive (think Wholefoods) and check-out can be exhausting!"

People are friendlier. The selection is better. And the prices are about 10% to 20% lower, depending on the product.

It’s also seems to be the one that the locals frequent, and the other one seems to be the one that the tourists frequent. Which may be why the other one has a bit more grumpy cashiers, having to deal with all the tourists!

This one clearly has staples for the family, but it also has rum, etc. Lots of families shopping here. Much much much better produce selection!

The only issue is that it closes early (sometimes they even close earlier than when they state on their info, so try to be there before closing time).

Oh, there’s a big parking lot along the side.; Get it while you can.
They hand cut there meat hear.
Decent selection of cheese's cut out of rounds.; A larger and easier shopping experience because some items have prices posted either on the shelf or on the products.

Vieques food stores don't see a need to price their food.

It's crazy to try and shop on a budget on Vieques. You may find 4 brands and no prices!

I try not to buy anything that is not priced.  This store does a better job letting the shopping public know how much stuff costs... still, only 40 to 50% of their products are priced.

I think a store could become the main shopping store for more people if they would price all their food and products.

They need to have more than 1 cashier.  Crazy to think 12 people are trying to check out. Wait or leave is the attitude.
Factor in no bags, no prices, can we say, delay!

Maybe Superdescuenttos Morales Market will be the pricing leader and have a working scamner more than one cashier at 3:00 pm?

The ""law"" says grocery stores are supposed to have a scanner!
Forget the law. Who cares if you get to know the prices?  The public that pays without government assistance doesn't worry about  it, O don't get free food, I like to know prices for choice if nothing else.

Grocery stores here seem to not care if you are on a budget or not. Buy it for whatever they tell you at the register or don't buy it! I was told exactly that at a downtown grocery mentioning Family. I don't shop there anymore !

So bring your bag or maybe? Wherever you shop.

Feeling lucky?
Maybe you can grab a box when you come in because they didn't have bags when I was shopping, but they seldomly have boxes.

The helpful clerks and an above average local selection for variety are mostly fresh.  I just wish everything was priced.

Check the 'sell by' labels and the packaged date.

The coolers/freezers were failing while I  was there or on the blink. Good luck...

All considered?  This is still the largest grocery on the island.; Best place on Vieques for basic groceries and alcohol for selection and price. Not the best for meats and veggies; Their selection of  vegetarian food was pretty good. (I didn’t know this was a vegetarian establishment before I went).

On the right hand side. Where there is one or two cashiers. They never even noticed me. I have entered the store two times this week and the same thing happens.
The rest of the store is laid out like a grocery store. They have produce section. But the prices seem a little high. In the meat section the meat was brown. So I went to the deli in the back of the store. They only had one brand of meat. I have never heard of the brand my whole life. The cheeses they sold were two or three kinds but the same brand. Three isles of shelf goods were packed with generic goods. Sold at or near name brand prices. I'm not even kidding you! You could get same goods in others stores in this city. And always see the same products on sale. Also canned vegetables that would be on sale at Price Rite or Save Alot were 1.79 ea.
Both times I went in this store. I walked out without buying anything. The only people that should even wasting thier money here are people that don't have a car. Or take a bus to a real Grocery store. Good luck!"

Like genuinely I rarely leave reviews but after years of living near this location I don’t understand how people choose this location over even the lowest tier Big Y store. You should all be embarrassed, waiting nearly half an hour in line is a regular occurrence and then the self checkout machines are nothing but issues even when you use them correctly. Just AWFUL.; Why cant S&S management  do like most other stores and LIMIT  the amount of items for those who want to use Self Checkout as a process to expedite their trip???
Why do they ALLOW people with FULL shopping carts this option when it ties up a spot for over 20+minutes.and truly slows down an otherwise ""express function""

I can go to Westfield or Westspringfield and get better prices with a lot more options . The aisles are much bigger in the other stores .

Prices have never been very competitive, but I accepted it based on the location. The main issue recently is chronic understaffing at the registers. They have been pushing self checkout, and it is not working out.; I do not usually leave bad reviews. Several people I know have had terrible experiences in this store since the new layout. The music is blasting and they put things beside other things that do not make sense, and it is meant to create either a joke or frustration and hatred among customers and employees. The last two times I have been in here, I have heard employees making comments about people being on welfare, and the final straw was when someone was talking about people on food stamps who worked there. I, or you, or anyone can be one paycheck away from being on the system. They make people who have state assistance feel uncomfortable in the store. When this place closes because they chose to make members of our community feel bad, just remember that karma is a b!; I hate the new layout of the store. Whoever thought outlining the border of your store with refrigerators doesn’t care about the customer shopping experience. No flow whatsoever and the groceries are disorganized.  Also, they don’t have enough staff to run the store especially in the deli.

Why did you increase the price of your store brand seltzer water by .40 cents and then advertise to customers that they will save $1.77 by purchasing store brand vs. competitor brand?

Instead of raising the prices of your products- Lay off the corporate morons, middle-man management team members and anyone who works remotely if you need to make money to be profitable…

Fix your rewards program so that customers can actually use the points easily to get the discount on their purchases.; Such a big store and the price is great! They have really great parking positions for handicap.; Not one of my favorite grocery stores. It's laid out weird and, no joke, I asked 4 different employees were items were, including asking one employees were pudding was (so nothing strange or unique) and every employee said the same thing ""that's not my area, I don't know"". The problem is no employee seem to have an area they knew anything about. I feel very sorry for people in Waltham that their chose of grocery stores is this one or Food Basket.

It was medium busy, but there were many employees around to help. The employees were friendly and helpful.

In terms of accessibility (our group had wheelchair users), the Market Basket was easy to get into. There were curb cuts to get up onto the sidewalk and there were no stairs. Once in the store it was a bit trickier to get around because the aisles were a little too narrow because it was quite busy with lots of people in them.

In terms of deals, there were quite a few buy 2 for a certain price. The overall prices of items were pretty cheap compared to other stores. In terms of cleanliness, the store felt clean and well kept. There were no spills or trash around.

Our overall experience at Market Basket was a very positive one. We really liked how it was decorated for fall with fall leaves hanging from the ceiling. It felt very festive and fun. There were also a good selection of balloons for events and celebrations.; This Waltham store is about 10 miles from home, but well worth it....
There are 2 other market baskets closer to me, ""BUT"", no other store compares to this branch. It's immaculate,  there's a GREAT variety of grocery items- the  produce + meat are great.  The beef is mostly Angus..  I haven't  tried the subs, but deli+ fish are fresh.
AMPLE parking.
PRICES ARE MUCH LOWER than other supermarkets  near me.✌️; This Supermarket is  the only supermarket  I've been to since covid and it's full staffed  with humans cashiers and I was so please to see that every corner of the store was fully utilized  by workers , there's never a dull moment  in the place. Keep up the good work  both managers and staffs; Overall a great place to shop and comparatively cheaper than the competition. No gimmicky coupons but overall lower prices and sales running over few items.  Great variety in household, grocery and day to day pharma. Nothing beats Market Basket in item variety and overall pricing. They have also been able to weather inflation far more than others on their own brands as well as others.

If you find walking a chore, the 70 bus marked Market Place Drive drops you directly there from different stops alongside the route.

Amenities:
1- Market Kitchen - their cafeteria makes fresh and cost effective foods. You can order in advance which is good because depending on the time of the day it can be quite busy like lunch time. Most foods on the grill are freshly prepped. The steak bomb, cheese burger and hot dog are great starts.
2- MB Wine & Spirits -  a spirits shop nearby that does tasting every now and then
3- Bottle/Can crushing on site.
4) Reasonable sitting space to enjoy your meals and benches outside the building for people waiting for their bus.

Tips:
a) Market Kitchen - Stay away from dinners as they aren't freshly prepared and sometimes rice and veggies can taste dated because they have been lying around. Additionally avoid evening pickups as the food may not be rotated as regularly. Check the timing of the kitchen before going because on Sunday it closes an hour earlier.

b) Their fruit section is competitive but sometimes other stores launch deals which can be cheaper.

c) Their fresh rotisserie chicken is good but not great and the taste degrades significantly when refrigerated. So if you are thinking of picking the frozen rotisserie for a few cents off, I would suggest do not.; The staff does their best to assist you in any way they can. They get 5 stars. The store is often chaotic and very busy. I love their prices but don’t like the shopping experience. Maybe consider stocking shelves when the business isn’t open. I’d love to see self-check outs installed."

Also had healthy options! The staff is very accommodating as well; They have cheap prices and high quality items especially all groceries and dairy , frozen and halal meat . Masallah 🙏; The first thing I noticed is that their entrance is not wheelchair accessible, but inside the stores is full of ramps. I like the variety of desserts, especially chocolates and frozen products. Things that you usually won’t find anywhere else. Things are too expensive. Staff doesn’t feel too welcoming.; Best european market in all of west springfield. Cheapest prices around.; Check the expiration dates of the products before you put them in your cart! I’m sick of finding out some of their products have already expired when I come home. It’s not one or two times but multiple times! I go there not because of the prices but for the variety. I’m aware of the high prices but I was kind of ok with that just because of the variety! However, now I don’t trust this store anymore! With the next item I find out that’s expired I’ll file an official complaint to the health department! I regret that I didn’t file a complaint because they were not following the mask guidelines of the state! I don’t even want to mention that!
Another issue with the place is that same items are priced differently! They don’t have an electronic inventory of their products but individually price them with the price tags. You can find the same item priced differently across the isle. You can be charged differently for the same price since they don’t scan the barcodes but enter the price on the tag."

Rosamarie and Rico are lovely people with an eclectic and interesting store. You can buy their house-label wine and buy Rico's book on Bocce—he'll even sign it for you. I got the Bocce Bella sandwich and can't regret it for under $10. You have to tour the shop, otherwise come back and check it out.; We had a variety of things and had a variety of differing opinions. I'm sure fresh food would've had a improvement upon this score. The guy who started this really was a pleasure. The ham and cheese sandwich for less than 2 bucks was a steal. Sandwich was actually a good bulkie ham and cheese. The risotto balls were terrible. Dry and rock hard. The last of the pasta we got was microwaved to heat it up and it was still cold. Meatball sub was very good! Just heated unevenly. And WAY TOO MUCH SAUCE. It's unfortunate, because the atmosphere was good too. I'd return for their homemade soda. Bocce soda; I ordered 2 large meat ball grinders with extra cheese extra sauce. She told me i't  be ready in 9 minutes when I went to go. Eat the Sandwich in the car, it was completely cold. The sauce was cold and meatballs were coldThe bread was soggy and.ripped YUCK! 32 BUCKS 😬; This place was recommended on Phantom Gourmet… drove from outside of Boston and the place  was a disappointment… the only thing that was good was a Macaroon  cookie; wholesome spot. lovely atmosphere and the owners are funny and personable. made me feel at home while i enjoyed my grinder!"

I was greeted immediately, asked what I needed & directed to where the items were. Prices were fair. Store seemed run down & not very clean. Seemed to have a wide variety of Indian food products so I will probably be back in the future.
Also worth noting that they accept EBT.; This is the worst place for grocery. The sale item are not for any kind of benefit they are the expired products. And when we tell them about it the staff is extremely rude. They would tell us to do our research before buying. Their grains were expired and they have very less shelf life too. Their mangoes are the worst thing to ever buy and the store owner is very unapologetic for it. None of the staff would ever feel sorry for the expired stuff they sell. We had bought almonds which were on sale but they had insects in it.

I would not recommend this place for grocery to anyone.; Was disappointed with the pricing as most of the products were way too high compared to the other Patel stores I shop at.
It definitely has a typical Indian atmosphere from the maintenance of the building.
It does have a good variety of fresh vegetables and Indian products...
Parking was hard.; Stopped in for a quick soda. Many sodas were months overdue. Had to search for a fresh one. Staff was friendly. The place is well stocked, very cluttered, but seemed clean.; DO NOT BUY MANGOES HERE! $55 a case, and They all look nice on the outside but they are all bad or rotten inside. The store owner will not tell you that this is expected until you contact them after to report the bad mangoes. Also, according to the store owner, apparently these mangoes undergo radiation before being sold. The store owner argued with me that I should have done my research, instead of apologizing and offering to take them back."

They may not carry everything or have what you need in stock, but in those two incidences they came through. They are open to 10pm nightly so in an emergency being a block away I don't have to make a long flip and travel to a major grocery store. The title ""Convenience Store"" is not a Misnomer.

I especially love their all ready to eat hot foods for when you need a break from making dinner for the family or just a quick bite for lunch.; This past Saturday, I had the pleasure of being served by two guys at the checkout counter, and I must say, the experience was exceptional. They both exhibited a friendly demeanor and attention to detail that made the entire transaction smooth and enjoyable. Moreover, they were incredibly resourceful, efficiently handling any challenges that arose during the process. They truly go the extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction. If you're looking for top-notch service, these gentlemen are your go-to. Highly recommend!; Lots of ready made food is why I love this place. I love the weekend dimsum to go. Bahnmi can be toasted if you ask. Some other basic Asian pastries. They have lots of great Chinese and Vietnamese specialties if you're an adventurous foodie. They don't advertise it, but they do rice plates, too. I love their kimchi style the most, because it's not too vinegary.

The grocery part of the store is cozy and will have the basics for South East Asian and Chinese cuisines, including a butcher and small seafood selection.; I go to this market every week. The cooked foods are great. Even the place is not too large, there products meet the demand so it will be easier to buy food.
Pros: good food, jackfruit is great.
Cons: small, only has max 3 cashers to check out."

Plants are not for sale😎; An amazing selection, friendly and helpful staff, all at shockingly low prices!; Visiting stores that aren't traditionally American can be scary for us who aren't of the culture. Thus place however makes it very easy to visit as a first time shopper as well as a returning shopper. The prices are much lower than the chain markets because they specialize in the products. Service is very friendly with little to no language barrier at all. I'll be returning soon and often.; This is a small store with only basic Vietnamese and Asian products. It’s like a mom and pop’s shop. As a Vietnamese, I came to support the local business.
After reading the reviews, I expected this place to be friendly. It was not.
A young Vietnamese woman with heavy make up at the register was incredibly rude and unfriendly. She never smiled and when I asked where are certain stuffs, she just stared at me for a very long time and pointed, when she spoke English just fine.
She did not represent the warm Vietnameses’ customer service back home.
If anyone just wants to come there for the products, I would say it is great. As for the register, just avoid the woman."

Red headed late-teen (?) cashier was miserable. First time ever that I was responded to with a curt, blunt, ""no"" when I asked to type in my phone number like I always do (never an issue before). Made me repeat my phone number multiple times. I specifically asked to buy 2 bags (25 items???) next thing you know...a single bag is being PACKED to the GILLS, including a half gallon of liquid! About 25 items in all. In one bag. It's sad that some people will never understand the basic concept of common consideration, not to mention, common sense. Expecting someone to carry all that with one hand is rude in itself. When I said (low tone of voice) that there was no way I could lift all that (wrist is compromised right now) her response was rude and snarky (""There's no need...""). There's no need for WHAT? For YOU? Yes, totally agree. If you're THAT precious and entitled, then you don't need to work for the public. I endured much worse in all my customer service jobs and an attitude like yours would have landed me right out the door.; I've been coming to this big y for a few weeks now because my daughters camp is close by so I frequently buy things and go to self checkout. Ive noticed the cashiers watching me each time as if im stealing which im not. I get food stamps so it would be silly of me to steal when im not even paying for them to begin with. Everytime I go there a cashier no matter where there standing comes and stands next to me without fail no matter how many other people are at self checkout. I caught the cashier leaning over and looking inside my bag today. This is ridiculous.  Between here and walmart im constantly followed and checked in on as a Black woman I find this to be frustrating and half the time im with my daughter so what would I be teaching her if im stealing? It hurts all of us. I already knew this company was racist to begin with but im tired of being treated as less than a person. And if you guys think im stealing because im rushing in and out the store I have to catch the bus to go home so thats why im rushing and ive been in retail since I was 18 your store Manager used to be my boss at Stop and Shop so im pretty sure I know the in and outs of a grocery store. If you don't believe me you can check the security footage of your employee looking inside my bag.; Definitely not ADA Compliant! I am the first one to give a great review when deserved. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in Fresh Acres.  I do not go there often so when I do, I enjoy shopping all their gourmet goodies and looking at the array of unique products. Yesterday being there, brought me to tears. I have had several back surgeries so depending on the day my back pain can be painful or very painful. Yesterday, it was very, very painful so I used one of the motorized carts and I am truly appreciative of stores that offer them.  Maybe it was the social distancing that amplified this but there were certain areas of the store that made it impossible to get through due to the sales displays in the isles. I highly doubt that management of this grocery store or any others take a ride in one of these carts to experience what shopping is like in their store using one. There were at least two areas in the store that made turning impossible.  Between the end cap sales displays and the displays in the middle of the isles I knocked over a total of three displays during my visit.  This is embarrassing and aggravating as I have to get out of the cart and bend over stressing my back to pick everything up.  As it stands now, I will not be going back until they are ADA compliant and I will be calling the general manager today.  In doing my research, here is what I found regarding the guidelines in grocery stores and being ADA compliant.                                                                               ""Grocery Aisles. Failing to provide wide enough walkways between shelving units can put a retailer in danger of noncompliance with the ADA. A minimum width of 36 inches is required. If the aisle is more than 200 feet long, a passing space of at least 60 inches by 60 inches must be provided""  I know they were not compliant in a few areas for sure.; Otherwise known as the fancy big y in the area, it's a chock full of specialty items at the deli, not to mention other parts of the door"

They also sell different Mexican grocery products, fresh meat, fresh tortillas from different vendors, and a variety of produce and beer. Support local and small business here.

I mean really excellent. They make chicken stew, menudo, beef stew and various types of salsas. I got a salsa and holy moly it was extremely authentic. They also sell lots of mexican candies, chips, drinks, cheeses and bread/pastries. My wife asked if they ever made Chile Rellenos and the employee made them upon her request & she loved them.

I'm so impressed with this Food4Less as it's very well-stocked and had great items for plant-based/vegan folks. I'm sensitive when it comes to drinking milk and this store had great oat milk alternatives for an affordable price! The store also had lots of cereal, supplies, bread, and alcohol! I got basic stuff like water, plastic supplies, breakfast items and honey. Everything was easy to find and the store was super roomy. I never felt cramped in the aisles!

The store has a bakery, alcohol section, and most standard commodities of a Food4Less, this store might be slightly bigger than some other stores I've been to. The staff was pretty mellow, so were the customers. I LOVE that there wasn't drama or shady things going on, I had a pleasant experience. Prices are excellent, I'm a boy on a budget and I don't have time for overspending so this store saved me haha.

There's plenty of parking out front and the cart stations are scattered throughout the parking lot for easy access. You can find this location in a busy part of town, however it never felt packed. The staff were working quickly! The only thing that kinda bothered me was the lack of bagging service, I guess not having a bagger cuts costs?; I've been a pretty loyal customer to this food 4 less, but recently their 1 working electric wheel chair was stolen, and because of this I'm unable to shop there, but alas that isn't even the reason for this 1 star review. The reason is, today Friday August 23rd, 2024 at 4:00pm I tried for 30 minutes (until 4:30pm) to call them, I tried all of their departments, no answer, I tried the produce department, and on several occasions someone picked up the phone (because I could hear the background noise) and just promptly hang it up without saying a word. I put it to the test and tried the produce department 5 times and I was hung up on 5 more times.

I was calling to see if your electric wheel chair has been found, but nobody answered me, so now it's off to Walmart instead. Thanks for nothing!; I writing this comment about this guy Cesar, who was working pulling the carts from parking lot on Tuesday October 1st about 3:40 pm. I still feel very upset by the offense against me, without me giving him any reason for him to offend me.
He was waiting to pass, I gave way to him, and he did not want to pass, I pointed out that I could also use the parking lot that he was blocking, and he waved no. I didn't complain to him, I continued to look for another parking space, and when I passed by him he insulted me. I parked and when I went toward the entrance he was there, and ask him what he said to me, despite I heard the offensive phrase clearly. And he exaggerating the hypocrisy ask me if he could help me.  I didn't argue with him, I just got his name from his tag, and I went to complain with the manager Sergio, who didn't show real interest about the issue, despite I pointed to the guy when he (Cesar) approached to us. They are lucky that I don't like to cause problems, cause I could called to police for his verbal attack. I am not going back to this store anymore, because normally it feels unsafe, now even more with this aggresive employee, I'm affraid to find him and he offens me again or even attack me or my car.; So About A Month Ago After Receiving My Tax Refund, I Went To Go Grocery Shopping At This Location Where Their Meat Department Manager Luis Treated Me An Innocent Customer Like A Criminal By Automatically Assuming I Was Going To Try And Steal Meat Like Steak When I Put It In My Personal Shopping Cart Even Though I Had The Money To Pay,It's Supposed To Be Innocent Until Proven Not The Other Way Around. This Meat Manager Luis Is Very Rude, Discriminating, Unprofessional And Needs To Be Held Accountable For His Actions Because This Type Of Discriminating Behavior Can Make A Customer Feel Unwelcome,Despite This Experience I Do Not Hold The Store Responsible But Only This One Individual; Anthony was my cashier today, he was very nice. I think this food4less has some really good employees always so helpful and happy considering the customers they get on a daily basis. Thank you for the great service today Anthony!"

I love authentic Mexican food, not like the knockoffs. The tamales was very good. The steak burrito made how you like is amazing. The El Chata was made perfectly.; I don’t know why I’ve not reviewed Los Altos Ranch Market before. I think the fact that you frequent some places commonly, you tend to put it on the back burner! Well, my last visit made me think twice about reviewing what we take for granted many times as this food market, that sometimes can run rings around some of our common go-to places locally for food, groceries and more. Los Altos Ranch Market, the one in South Phoenix on Central Avenue location in particular, is astounding in size and has a mini-mall aspect whereby everything a supermarket has as groceries, produce, meat and fish, delicatessen, dairy, yet also offers take-out from their inhouse kitchen (plus inside seating if you wish), which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, plus a bakery and tortilleria. You can also find money services, boots and shoes, and some clothing, among quite a few other things. One of the most impressive things for me is the freshness of meats, dairy and produce, organization, cleanliness and personal service. I have yet to have any purchase returned due to lack of quality or freshness as I’ve had to at some area name markets. Although they are Southwestern conglomerate spanning California, Nevada and Arizona, you feel the vibe and service of a local, neighborhood and community market. These reasons and more are the motives for my wife to enjoy shopping here. Check it out, your pantry and tummy will thank you for it.; Market has a lot of latin.products you might be looking for. The kitchen area has pretty good good, I've got a couple of different plates and have all been pretty good. Fresh made tortillas and sweet bread available. Sometimes, they have some good deals. I always find what I  need. However, the check out line is always backed up since the times I've gone, only 1 register is open. They have a couple of self checkout but most of the time is really slow and long line as well. I've also gone a couple times and I have to go back to parking lot to get a shopping cart since there aren't any available in front of store.; Got marinated ground beef from the butcher and the styrofoam was all throughout the meet. So I am assuming they took beef from their shelf in the package and ground it up with the bottom Styrofoam on it and then marinated it. I am not only disappointed but I am alarmed by it. I will not be going back.; Overall, the produce is really good. I like the rewards program & their street tacos."

The bench seats were clean and the line to eat was consistent.
She and her crew are worthy of bringing the flavors of Mexican cooking to Phoenix Arizona..; When you are barely able to keep up with inflation, the current economic situation, and all the increasing costs of food, this is my go to place! I have shopped here before, don’t get me wrong. It has all that you would need for the Mexican food you know you crave! Making it saves you money and shopping here helps you save money! I only bought $99.50 in groceries here. But I have 16 days of meals, buying 6 packages of 2 large packages of pork stew meat, 1 package of beef Eye of the round flat steak and 3 packages of chicken. Keep in mind, I breaking down and separating the individual dinner portions into frozen ziplock bags for dinner. And buying frozen veggies to add to the meal. I can find all that I need to make it stretch. Even a huge jug of spaghetti sauce was just a tad bit more than 2 individual jars somewhere else, but here  $7.49. Now I like to cook and I can make a meal for 2 with leftovers, just by cooking and adding to it, including vegetables, or rice or homemade beans.  A good size bag of Mexican cheese $8.99. Canned green chili sauce 2.49 for larger can. Where you shop is a personal choice. Seriously, I go out of my way to shop here. Saving is the name of the game and Mexican food groceries and food to pick up and eat in store or take home. They have fresh sweet breads and cakes and everything you need for those home made tamales or tacos or your favorite home made salsas. And don’t forget the cold cervezas, cause they have that here too! Enjoy!; I wanted In line to order and they took my order as expected however then the lady who took my order left to the back for like 10 minutes and then when she did come back she starts closing. Like why take my order and have me wait there just for you to start closing unbelievable will not be returning……; Nicole on register 6 today (9/30/24) had an old man bag his groceries as she saw him struggling to even open the bag. All she did was push his groceries closer to the edge as to separate them, to start scanning the next customer instead of helping him... she didn't even have a line I was the only one behind him. As he left I knew she'd do the same to me. I bagged as quick as I could but yet she started scanning the next person (only 1 behind me) our products were mixing and she just looked at us as we decided what was whose. Guess that's all the kind of employees you get these days. What a shame.; We went into this franchise and shopped my husband and I proceeded to check out and had to wait in line for more than 20 minutes on top of that a manager walks by looking at all of us and proceed to walk past us instead of requesting back up cashier. As we finally made our way to the front the cashier was very quiet didn't speak and not once greated us nor thanked us for coming. We really love coming in to this store has great prices on things we need but poor  customer service and management."

If I could give them 0 stars, I would, because that’s what they deserve.

Its a short walk from the port if you're coming in from the ship, but im sure even the locals, come from the island's interior to shop here... prices are dirt cheap, especially for it being a US municipality... shop with confidence... and budget some time, the place is huge...

all the top tier retail name brands... all the zero calorie drinks and juice varieties you never knew existed, all the booze... tall one liter bottles of Fiji water for under two dollars... even whole cabinets of cigars and tobaccos...
.; Cool inside and they have quite a selection! Bought souvenirs and drinks. Went back a second time.; My family and I stopped into this store a couple of weeks ago to grab a few drinks. Yes, they had a good selection of items, but the staff is absolutely atrocious.
It was a little cramped where the line was forming and I was trying to be polite and move out of the way. A young woman employee came through and rudely waved her hands to move us all out of the way without saying a word.
Then as the line moved up, the male employee behind the counter rudely announced that we HAD TO BE ON THE WHITE CIRCLE. I never saw the white circle on the floor, but if I had I wouldn't have even known what it was for. Maybe put up better signage if you're so strict about how or where the line forms!
If it hadn't been for us being so parched from the heat, those drinks would have gone right back on their shelves.
We go on many cruises and will be back in San Juan, but I will refuse to go back here so employees can speak to my family so rudely and condescendingly.; Good only if you must. I was happy when  I first found the store within walking distance of my Airbnb. But their selection is limited and the personnel at the register were completely disinterested.  They have more than bare essentials. SomE of the prices are absurd.  For example, the woman at the register spoke very good English so there’s not much chance she misunderstood me told me that a mango cost $3.79.  I repeated the number to her and asked if she meant for one mango and she said yes then I stood there with the items I was actually going to purchase, and she ignored me so much that I just left after replacing the items where they belonged.; One of the two supermarket options I know about in OSJ. I personally like Supermax better, but this is still a very solid store with a decent selection. Clean and solid prices."

While prices have increased, this is a common trend across other supermarkets as well. The renovated store has brought about some challenges in terms of finding certain items at times.

They offer a great variety of products, including their own store brand, which covers almost everything, including dog food. This extensive range of options ensures that customers can find what they need conveniently in one place.

The complete remodeling or updating of the building has had a positive impact on the shopping experience. The store now provides more room, creating a spacious and airy atmosphere. With these improvements, customers can navigate the aisles comfortably and enjoy a pleasant shopping environment.

However, considering the overall quality and variety of products available, the prices at Econo Supermercados remain competitive. The supermarket has managed to strike a balance between maintaining affordability and providing a diverse range of goods.

In response to changing customer needs and preferences, Econo Supermercados has recently installed self-checkout counters. This new feature allows customers to scan and pay for their items independently, enhancing the convenience and efficiency of the shopping experience.

In summary, despite the price increases and occasional challenges in finding items, Econo Supermercados is still regarded as one of the best supermarkets in the area. The wide selection of groceries, including the store brand, the spacious and updated store layout, and the addition of self-checkout options all contribute to its overall appeal.

It’s always a pleasure to do business with Joanna, and her professionalism and kindness are truly appreciated.; Great selection of wines and spirits, i was especially surprised with their vast amount of seasonal items.... and the floral department is top notch!; Typical grocery store with nearly everything you could want. The best aspect are the non- grocery services like the pharmacy, the florist, and the coffee shop, which is a Starbucks. They have a pretty good deli, too.; Everyone that works here is super nice and friendly!!
They have a great pharmacy and just about everything you would need. There’s always allot of room in the parking lot making it easy to get in and out; It's a great place to shop for groceries, friendly staff with Starbucks in store, they also have great selection of alcohol."

The store was clean and well-organized. They offer a good variety of produce. The cashier was okay, though a bit less cheerful than I would have liked. Despite this, I’ll continue to shop here for my Mad Hippie products.; This is a smaller Whole Foods. It has everything I need. I love the 365 Mashed Potatoes. They were out of them for a while. They have a good variety of organic foods. A nice variety of supplements. They have calrose rice. I can't find that anywhere else. The employees are the best. I talked to quite a few. All super friendly and helpful. They have nice looking clothes too.; This place has such a good bakery! I am currently addicted to the Peach Marionberry Pie.

I always come in here for their bottled water, mango and HydroFlask deals. Lots of ready-made prepared meal options both hot and cold. Organic selection is what you would expect from a Whole Foods.

Plenty of parking and the ease of using your Amazon Prime here is AWESOME.

Respectfully Reviewed; Things are fresh, a lot of advanced food, and I like it very much. I have everything I need here, and there are many parking spaces.; My rating is based on this being a 365 version and not the full scale whole foods. It's a nice sized trendy looking store, great produce in a large walkthrough area along the left wall when you enter the store. The food in the self serve hot and cold bars looked very fresh, they had more vegan options than some of the full stores i've been in, and the areas were clean. The foods were clearly labeled with the ingredients, which was awesome. It is really scaled down from the full version, so don't go in expecting the same variety of snacks,  juices, bulk spices or nuts. But they do a great job of covering the basics. The workers were nice and helpful, and the cashier said they'll be expanding it into a full store, so that will be a huge bonus. Even as a 365 I'd shop there again.

Had to drop review to 4 stars. Went to return items and was advised only the store supervisor had the code to do (and she was currently locked away in her office taking a test for the next hour). They don't have a customer service area to do returns. The store manager said he didn't even have the code to do the return. Good grief."

The staff does not seem to understand the importance of treating customers with respect, despite customers choosing to spend their time and money there. It is perplexing why the staff finds it so challenging to provide a pleasant experience during transactions.

The majority of employees, approximately 90%, lack an understanding of good customer service. Many appear consistently upset about their jobs, which is evident in their careless interactions with customers. When customers are lost, have questions, or face lengthy processes, the staff displays little patience or tolerance. It often feels as though they believe they have the right to treat customers poorly due to dissatisfaction with their paychecks and boredom with their roles. As a result, customer service at this location is severely lacking.

The pharmacy staff, in particular, exemplifies this issue. When seeking clarification about a delay in my prescription refill, I was treated as if my request for more information was an inconvenience. After being given a vague and inaccurate explanation, the staff showed little willingness to provide further details. This level of service is unacceptable and underscores the broader issues with customer service at this Walmart.

Furthermore, the woman who took my call became visibly upset and abruptly asked her coworker to speak with me, stating she couldn't handle the situation. I overheard her coworker attempting to calm her down, but she yelled into the phone that she didn't care and then hung up on me after stating her name. This occurred because they claimed I hadn't provided a justification letter for my prescription refill, despite my certainty that I had, just as I had done for the past ten years. She insisted they never lose anything, but I pointed out that I had experienced their mistakes before. I simply wanted to understand why they said my doctor's letter was expired when it was issued the same day as my prescription.

This level of service is unacceptable. If you decide to shop at Walmart, be prepared to encounter poor service and to solve your own problems without expecting assistance. The staff often displays a lack of motivation to help customers, brushing them off or providing vague answers that leave you more confused.

Customer service excellence is clearly not a priority at this location. They seem to take their customers for granted, likely due to the limited shopping options in the area. Their focus appears to be on minimizing interaction with customers to concentrate on other tasks. Smiling, kindness, and patience are notably absent.

To avoid these negative experiences, consider making a list and focusing solely on finding the items yourself. If you need help, avoid asking staff to prevent encountering their attitudes and indifference. Alternatively, switch to online shopping and opt for curbside pickup, which allows you to avoid direct interaction and receive your items without dealing with unmotivated staff. This approach can help you avoid the frustration and poor service that seem prevalent at this Walmart.; Very well stocked.  Excellent staff.  Clean and organized store.; They charge me twice for dog food...rigth there and there!!they told the can't refund me  the other $70.56.....the system will clear it up and correct it itself!!! Really BAD CUSTUMER SVC.GUAYAMA,PUERTO RICO.; Very organized layout of products. Service is professional and helpful. Location from bathroom and althroughout the store is clean. Great experience!; Prices are a little high compared to us and in the front they have hard liquor, which us Walmart does not have."

This is the best little market on the Eastside of Tucson. Also the prices are awesome and the store is always clean. Bravo to this small business, keep up the good work.; This place is okay a lot of things are too expensive but the workers are really awesome people.; I went to food City there and I love the freshly made tortilla chips so I crave them and drive all the way across town to go get them lol big store clean and friendly people as well as employees definitely recommend going there for sure 👍👍; went to food city on 6th Avenue on the way to Rodeo Park to get cochitos. I ended up getting their pumpkin empanadas. They could have used more pumpkin as the outer shell was thick. Good none the less.

No pictures cuz they were gobbled up! 😋"

I gotta talk to whoever is in charge of her.; What a fun grocery shopping experience. HUGE bright, open, clean marketplace LOADED with hard to find specialty foods all under one roof. You could easily spend an hour here. Huge queso wheels up to 12 pounds, an enormous meats, fish, poultry section with HUGE selections. Food is ultra fresh. Friendly staff. Eat-in grill.

Never again will we go there. Yuck!; The best carneceria in town. Love their marinated meat. Chicken is the best. Guacamole is my favorite.; Best meat market in Casa Grande.  Several months ago, I tried a Carniceria on Cottonwood that is much closer to my home.  Its service was radically inconsistent.  One person would go out of his way to get me what I wanted, another would say, ""I can't help you with that.""  I decided to try the Mercado y Carniceria El Pinal on N Casa Grande Ave.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised.  They went out of their way to get me EXACTLY what I wanted which was a thicker cut of beef than what was in the display case.  I returned several times and each time, they make the special cut so I get what I wanted.  The owner gave me her phone number and told me to call her if I was ever at the shop and someone failed to get me what I wanted.  THAT is customer service.  The FACT that the quality of the meat is excellent is over-powered by the customer service I have received every time I visit the store.  DEFINITELY worth the extra five-minute drive.; The man who helped me with the meat department was extremely nice. He took his time with trying to understand me. But the lady who checked us out was EXTREMELY rude. And also charged me whatever price she wanted to I bought about 4 things and it came out to 120$ ! And when I tried asking her about it she claimed she didn't know English. Worst.  Customer service ever."

Lately I've been stopping to pick up meat when I'm passing through the area, their chicken leg quarters are huge!

It's a busy spot so you can count on it taking 10-20 minutes if you need anything behind the counter; Great Tacos! Ordered 3, best was the Pollo, then Carne Asada, then the Carnitas. They were filling and fresh made. They have an excellent selection of hot sauces and toppings. - 1 star for cleanliness and gas station feel but to be fair it is a market/butcher; I don't know why, but AZ has the best Mexican food I can find anywhere.

Nice flooring.  Neatly stacked vegetables & fruit, new self-serve deli!, nice service deli, very clean!  Still low food prices.  Some neat high end fancy food choices too.  The bakery cakes were professional looking.  It is a pleasure to shop in this store.    I am highly impressed by the great remoleded store & it's new layout too.  I guess this store competes with Trader Joe's nearby & the soon to be built nearby Whole Foods, & perhaps the small Target food store nearby.  This store's prices are quite low, & the food is of high quality.  So far I have not read of food recalls for Lucky, but I keep reading about food recalls at TJ's & some at Whole Foods.  It's not their fault, but still.  It is what they choose to sell that keeps getting recalled.  Not so far at Lucky!  May, 2021.  Their buffet bar is open again.  Tasty.  7/8/21: The hot bar food was good.  June, 2023: The cashier would not tape my buffet box, so it spilled over in my car!  I was so 😡 upset!  I will request a refund for that!  Also, they do not have enough cashiers!  7/1/23: The deli (manager?) lady was wonderful.  I told her how my last buffet box 📦 spilled in my car 🚗.  She told me to fill a buffet box 📦, so I did.  She gave me the box for free!  I felt redeemed.  I was grateful.; Really, really big Lucky.

Huge inventory.

Short staffing cashiers creates long lines. Additionally, few or no carry baskets. More carts in aisles creates more crowding.

I like that there is such a variety of foods - of pretty everything.

Deli section with hot foods.

Flowers and plants and party supplies and greeting cards.

Really large section of toiletries such as you might find in a small CVS or Walgreens.  Plus Pharmacy.

Coin thing - to turn in coins and get cash.

Good place to pick up supplies for a picnic at the beach.

Wide aisles.

Store is very clean.

Parking lot is busy. Not many spots if you need accessibility parking spot.; I don't usually post reviews pertaining to staff who work at a store but anyone who cares about how their lunch is prepared will enjoy this. I had the pleasure of having my sandwich prepared by Gloria at the deli. It's like she read my mind and actually put effort into making it as of it were her own lunch. I just had to take the time to post about this because it means a lot to me to see someone put the effort in. Good job girl💪; Beware buying gift cards at this Lucky.  The 3 gift cards I bought got tampering. The store manager told me to call  their 1800 number, nothing he could do.  So did their customer service said these are my total lost. I reported this to the SF police. I asked them to put warning sign so customers aware there is big risk buying gift cards. Scammers swap cards here and NO REFUND under Lucky policy."

It's fallen apart since Bruce moved. Current kids doing it are even slower AND arent even trying to match brands and flavors.

I called ahead to make sure someone would be available. When I got there the answer of the employees was “ we are short of people” I awaited around 20 minutes for them to figure who could get things done. None of the department staff had idea on how to handle this. They voiced the manager Kelly on the speaker and she never came. Nobody cares, nobody wants to have ownership for their attitude or attention to customers. Terrible customer service and management. I left empty handed after 20 mins.

I just happened to be nearby (at the DMV), and decided to pick up a few things before I headed back home. I must say, this was the EMPTIEST supermarket (in terms of customers in store) I think I've ever been to! I was here on a Monday, kinda mid-day, and there was just, like, NO ONE there (I always feel like this is a sign of something. Kinda like an empty restaurant). I bought a few small items. And I must confess, I kinda felt like I was being watched while I was in there, like they were concerned I might shoplift or something. I felt this air of suspicion even AFTER I checked-out. Very strange. It's unlikely I'll go again, as this is not in my neighborhood, but I wouldn't want to, either.

The prices I encountered were just sort of OK. Kind of on-par with Safeway.; Lucky's grocery store on Masonic & Fulton is so important to the area. I particularly feel that the fried chicken is better than Popeyes or Safeway. The SF. Fulton Street store is clean and organized. I was surprised to see Krispy Kreme donuts sold in the store.; Nice store with huge variety of stuff. There is also a party section. There is a Poppy Bank. We love this clean store.; This Lucky sucks. Pricing is all sorts of backwards, sometimes doubling or tripling the same exact item at Safeway. Worst of all was during a recent trip there a rude security guard approached my wife, accused her of shoplifting and demanded to search her purse. Upon finding out he was way out of line, and there were no hidden items in her bag....no apology. He  only stated, and I quote, ""yah, cuz when you came in here you didn't have nothing"", and turned around and walked away? What the hell does that mean? I believe she was owed a polite, and sincere apology. This is absolutely the last time we will ever shop here!; My absolute favorite supermarket.
Reminds me of a suburban supermarket bc it's huge.
Friendly staff, great security, tins of options.
The only thing I have trouble with here is there floral is simple under serviced. Not one decent arrangement ever."

Its DTLA and I get it but  I didn't like the fact that they ask you to put your bagpack behind a counter. When we asked the security guard if it was safe there, he didn't really have an answer *missing star

I’m at a loss of whether Galleria is better than H-Mart both offer great deals, H-mart do have more hot food selection, both locations clean, H-mart did seem small and super cramped, I did like the ample seating at Galleria and the restaurant serving hot affordable food was soooo good.

This location usually isn't too packed and is surrounded by a lot of other businesses.; This review is for the employee deisy very friendly awesome helper good vibe the sunshine to the store; The cashier Daisy was terrible at her customer service skills.  She gave the 'last' customer in line the job to tell other customers that she was closed, yet she hadn't turned off her service light. She denies me service, yet she accepts one man after me. She denies two other women and then accepts another man. That's when I spoke up after she denies a fourth woman and I told her it's not fair that she helps others when I was next and she denied me. She rudely said it was because they only had a few things to purchase and I repeated that it still wasn't fair and the least she could do is turn off her light so others aren't trying to get in her line and she gave attitude and she suggested I talk to her supervisor if I wanted to and said that she's been working for the last 8 hours when little did she know I had been working for 10 but I am not advertising it. Was she trying to get me to feel bad for her?  I talked to her supervisor Adriana and the she asked if I wanted to speak to the next person up?  I said yes, please because the cashier Daisy kept eyeing me down with some arrogance in her look which again is very unprofessional.  I told her my purchase is helping pay her salary and even then she didn't apologize for her rudeness toward me.  As I was waiting for Alex, the next person in charge, Daisy, the rude and arrogant cashier walks up to another employee and in Spanish and very childish manner says, ""Seriously, she's going to talk to Alex,"" for which I replied in Spanish, that ""Yes, seriously."" Perhaps she thought she was going to be more rude about the incident and speak in Spanish in front of me without realizing I understood her.  After that, she walked away and out of the store. I spoke to Alex and let him know that we are all tired here some of us getting off of work trying to get our groceries and I didn't come to be treated like that.  Both Adriana and Alex apologized for Daisy's behavior and it's a shame that Daisy herself didn't have enough self control to begin with, confused and angered more costumers, and didn't have enough sense to apologize herself.; Very well stocked, clean and organized. The cashiers are very welcoming, friendly and helpful.

I go inside, and grabbed my items, get to the register and it’s a long line. As I stand in one of the lines, I noticed some of the workers at another register (it looked like they were getting it ready to open up). So I asked the representative Kevin, if that register was going to open. He asked the representative David (who was at the register) if he was opening up and David looked up at me and looked at Kevin and said no. So Kevin told me no. No problem. So I stay in my line (which was moving pretty swiftly) and as I approach the representative at the register in my line, I look over and notice David approach a couple (that looks much different then myself) and ask them if they would like to check out at his register. At first, I was a little confused but then I thought, hey, this couple is a little on the elderly side (may have a few items to buy; I couldn’t see their basket). No worries. But then I look up and notice this couple had a lot of groceries. Definitely more than the two ground beef’s, three jars of spaghetti sauce, two pack of noodles and a bottle of juice I was purchasing. Definitely made me feel some type of way because literally seconds had passed since the “No” I received when I asked to the gesture the other shoppers (who again did not look like me) received when they didn’t even inquire whether or not the register was open. Dont want to jump to conclusions or make accusations, but I could not help but feel overlooked and for me, I couldn’t help but feel it had ties to my race. I asked and got a no. They didn’t ask and was OFFERED to check out at the register. I had a few times to buy. They had a LOT MORE than I did to buy. I am Black. They were Latino and living in a predominantly Latino community, sometimes one can feel overlooked or ignored but in that moment in the store, it didn’t feel like a feeling. It felt more like a reality and I didn’t enjoy my experience at all. I spoke with Kevin and thanked him for his help and spoke to Samuel who said he would look into the matter more closely and despite their professionalism and assistance and acknowledgement that yes, something was definitely different from the response I received to the gesture the other couple received, I can not help but feel that nothing would be done. However, I’m hopeful and just wanted to bring some awareness to my experience at this location.; The staff has 0 respect to customers. They complain about customers and yet they need them to maintain their business. Some people don’t deserve work. They should all be replace by AI and technology. Literally, many need to level up and look for a harder job. Hopefully, the employees and those using hard drugs including cigarettes suffer job loss or hours are cut because the management is completely a mess and no one is taking the business serious.; Was told I wasn't allowed in with a bag, I've lived in the neighborhood for 10 years. No signs saying no bags allowed, and then he let people in with bags. Asked me to leave the bag at the entrance but was not responding if someone stole it.; Not enough cashier available line are long waiting time to much. I think next time I go to food 4 less better; I was accused of stealing by Joana and cashier's yet when confronted outside in front of the store I had nothing from their store I had stolen nothing. I even told them I'm not even going to get upset because I know I didn't do anything but I told him you are going to give me the number to the corporate office and you're going to tell me who told you I was stealing because I know that that's my right I also know from having a guard card that you're not supposed to confront anyone about stealing unless you are certain and certain is the word that they have stole something otherwise you have now put yourself in a predicament where you can be sued. If you are African-American shopping at this market it will be presumed that you are stealing I even told them as I left just because I'm African-American doesn't mean I'm stealing from your store. This is a photo of paper I received from the manager with the information I requested."

They have nice and reasonably priced souvenirs here. I bought a hat and a mug to take home.; This is the best Walgreens I've ever been to. So good, in fact, that I shopped there 8 times in my 3 days in Condado. Full grocery store and massive alcohol selection. You've never seen anything like it. Also the nicest staff you'll ever meet, cracking jokes and doing all they can to make sure you have a pleasant experience. The perfect pharmacy.; Went to pick up itch cream for bug bites.  The only thing is the cream did not have a seal. Open 24 hours.; Different from your average Walgreens in the mainland.  Hard liquor at the entrance,  and a whole grocery store in the back; We bought an umbrella to use at the beach and used it for maybe 5 minutes. It kept blowing over and was very poor quality. We kept the umbrella in our hotel for 2 days because we had other plans. When we tried to return it, the store refused to accept it saying “it’s used”. Obviously it was going to be used. The product didn’t work. Any other store I’ve been to has accepted returns like this. Very disappointed. Don’t buy anything from here unless you’re 100% sure the product is good quality and you will not return it. The store should have a “no returns” sign on the door."

Not cheap, but has lots of vegan options that make it worth the drive.  Fake meats and cheeses abound.  There really is something for everybody.  Does well on organics and even has its own line of foodie goodies.  Perhaps, as for me, this isn't your neighbourhood pop in shop, but I highly recommend it when super groceries are your top priority.; Customer Service is lacking with Sherrie and her bagger. No acknowledgment the entire transaction, but I guess for observation sake it would be far too rude to not merely say “Thank you” at the END of the transaction which seemed so cringe for her to perform. Didn’t even ask if I had my own bags or if I found everything ok. No “hello”, no nothing.  I guess her personal conversation she was having with her bagger was much more important than doing her job and acknowledging her customers that make her paycheck possible.

We have lots of students with Stanford University and elderly people on fixed incomes; a store like this is very helpful to their budgets. The store takes snap EBT cards and I found out that you can buy starter vegetable plants for your garden and Snap will pay for it. I took this picture last weekend.

This location is a very nice store. It's clean and it has a really decent selection of many favorites that you can get at any grocery store, but at Grocery Outlet for a much better price.

Best, the store is small, easy to navigate for somebody with mobility issues to go through and the employees are friendly and helpful.; Love this place! New surprises of products and low prices at every visit. Their ice cream freezer is incredible with lots of options. They also have a fitness section with protein and green drinks.; This place sucks. They messed up all their inventory and even employees don’t know the location of certain items. Besides, ask yourself a question, why are you shopping in this grocery store when everything as expensive as in other stores. Just go somewhere else for better deals and quality.; Its an ok store, but i was a little disappointed. Prices are the same if not more than trader joes, which is my baseline for an excellent grocery. They do have more stuff, medicine, toiletries, pots and pans, but the layout is just a little sad, as is the produce section. They do have a nice big wine section and lots of brand name stuff as well as their own organic brand. So if you’re coming from whole foods the quality will be lower, as will the prices, but i think trader joes ties in price for most things and beats on quality.; Great prices, selection varies somewhat.

Found this place on accident driving by… the produce section alone is the best we’ve seen outside of Berkeley Bowl! Whole Foods should rename to One-Tenths Foods!

Ken thoroughly schooled us and gave us an excellent demo to find the perfect melon. The fresh guacamole was also one of the best I’ve ever had. Love this place!; I find the produce good here. But it's odd they can't serve any usda prime, only choice. I've had many negative encounters with a checkout man. They have a new system for self checkout but don't follow order if you're in line.

You call them and still not help at all.; I’ve been to many PF nationwide and in PR and I have to say this one does not meet the standard I’m used to seeing. Validated parking is great, entrance is great, but the rest just seems like a local run down gym with rust and grime on the machines. I saw literally not one guest clean the machines after or before use, no gym etiquette, they will literally take your machine or accessory right in front of you.

I hang out with my daughter and we found her rude and offensive.  Then we went to the next hall and the same clerk we hurried with. About 5 times the announce and order to be fast. We find the items and pay.  Absurd, rude.  Employees protect themselves with gloves, masks, and sanitizer.  Cleaning at the cash register, on the shopping baskets,on the shopping cars Get shots when it's their turn for added protection.; More like a convenience store.

The morning attendant took a long time to set the pump and when she did, she only set it for $10 instead of the $20 that I had paid.
I can't tell if she was just slow or wasn't awake yet as her hair was still wet or if she was actually trying to scam me.; Just a Few Tips for This Store:

1. Check Your Receipts!!!! They are the only store in Littlerock who takes those cool 50¢ coupons you get in cigarette packs so I went and gave them my coupon and the price went from 6.33 (higher than the normal price) to 5.83 (their normal price for marlboro 100s) after the coupon. I just paid and went to tell my fiance to let him handle it. He told my fiance that he forgot to add the coupon and gave him 50¢. The guy tried to cheat us out of a measly 50 cents and had the audacity to lie to my fiance like I didn't notice what he tried to do. Very shady dude.

2. Check dates on all products!!!! Especially the sodas that are EXTREMELY UNSAFE TO CONSUME AFTER EXPIRATION.  I received a small bottle of coke that was 4 months over the expiration date. The same guy tried telling me it didn't expire until 2015. I looked around and didn't see any other sodas that had a 2015 expiration date. He refused to exchange for a newer soda or a refund because I took one sip before checking the date on the bottle. Its my understanding from working at a gas station for just a few years that the gas station clerks are supposed to be checking this very crucial detail regularly. They do not check the dates on ANY product EVER. Check all snacks and drinks please!!!

3. Go the extra mile for cheaper, better quality gas. They charge ten or more cents over other stores in Littlerock.

I've tried giving this store too many chances. Every time I go in there I have had to spend extra time doing their job for them. I'm not sure why these people are in business at all.; I'm so thankful this store saved Our Christmas I for to get Marconi pasta for my Mac and cheese, and all the stores are closed. wish I could give the owner a big Hug Thankyou....; Always get a receipt! The older ladies working there don’t know how to be a cashier! They over charge and most of the time they rather be filtering with the guys!"

My order is usually accurate and always ready on time. I always help load my groceries and tip. It's really a convenient service.
I have unfortunately started having an issue with one of the young female employees (K) who always seem to have an attitude toward me for no reason and is usually short when checking my order out. I've avoided shopping here a few times because of this one issue. Otherwise its always been a excellent experience; I went to the gas station to get gas and I put a 20 and a 5 dollar bill down for gas accidentally said wrong pump number then told the lady and she even repeated the 25 only gave me 5 dollars worth of gas I went back and told her i gave her 25 she stole 20 from me they even looked at cameras Kroger owes me 20 dollars it was their employee and their mistaje they should have made it right it would not break their bank whatso everibwill never go there again and I will tell everyone about it and how their employees are dishonest and steals from costumers this is at brettwood kroger they stole from my kids eating and to get to places 20 is alot when your struggling; Ok for the most part but look its clear kroger gets tax credit for hiring certain people but know this just because you have issues and 6ft and life hasn't been kind doesn't give you an excuse to be ignorant rude and almost causing injury but this is 2024 and companies love to pay for the stupidity of thier workers.; They are restocking, and aisles are a mess.  Carts can't go in both directions.  The products on shelves are not accessible.; I've only had a problem with one employee at this store and I believe she is gone. I want to point out the pharmacy here is excellent compared to Airport Plaza that picks and chooses who they will fill a legitimate prescription for. Brentwood Village is definitely my choice!"

Great place.; Since there aren’t any reviews on the accompanying laundromat I thought I’d put one.
The washers are all extremely dirty and some (if not all) are filled with some type of mold where the soap goes. The dryers give off a smell of burnt wires or something that’s just horrendous. A laundromat should smell good but this one doesn’t. Most of the machines are broken or really beat up, and there’s never an attendant in the actual laundromat itself. The bathroom never had any toilet paper either.; I always give him the benefit of the doubt .

Staff is friendly, the owner is around a lot, she remembers me, and is very friendly. The reason why it's not a five star review is because it tends to be a little messy, the pricing of the products is not always clear or just altogether missing, and things can be a little pricey (I can understand that because some of these specialty items can be expensive and and hard to find, even online). Despite that, I still recommend it 100%.; Retail and wholesale keeps them moving product daily, makes their sushi fresher from anywhere else. Homemade kimchi is a must, friendly staff will help you in every step of your shopping.; I love the attention that they give, The store it have a great variety of items, The food was tasty (best sushi I've taste) and the Items I shop were in the store were great prices, original, good quality.

The little sushi restaurant attached to the market is adorable, and the food is very affordable and delicious. The spicy tuna roll is one of my favorites! There are tables to sit and enjoy your meals. Take out is also available. The owner is just the sweetest person you could ever meet! She is very helpful and knowledgeable. Great food that is affordable and friendly service. The location and hours of operations is convenient and user friendly. They have great hours Mon- Sat 9:30a-8p and they are closed on Sundays. They are located close to the major highways and other shopping and parking is free and no hassle.; Good store, nice employees and tasty food service.

They threw it together in a piss poor effort with pinwheel wraps falling apart etc, the guy in charge ended up telling us they would not charge us for it and once he left the rude deaf women at customer service said they talked to someone else and only were taking one of the 7 trays off.

I should've just walked out the food looks like trash; There is a lady that supervises the front end, she marches around in a dictator fashion, barking orders at staff and customers alike. It fills me with an uncomfortable enjoyment, exquisitely embarrassing. Her level of anger at this poor staff is menacing. I'm just waiting for to scream ""No soup the for you, get out"". Don't go when she is working.; This Kroger pharmacy is amazing. They are always welcoming and know what I need. If you have questions, someone is always available, and I can not praise the staff here enough.

The store itself is a little older, but it is still always easy to find what I am looking for. It's always a great selection of fresh baked goods, fresh meat, and seafood, and organized well.

My biggest co.plaint of this location is the parking lot, and it's set up. It could be better and have a better flow.; Last three times I've shopped here I've been talked to by front end employees like I'm an idiot. Once is a fluke, twice is a problem, three times is 100% on Kroger's end. Try another location.; If I could leave negative stars, I would. Consistently the absolute worst Kroger in the area, by far. In there multiple days a week, every week, and the produce is always almost completely bare. The bakery is a joke, with almost always nothing stocked. Went today and there was not a single loaf of bakery bread available. You would think with the volume this store gets, they would be able to maintain inventory to at least have a single loaf of bread available. Meat selection is consistently within 2-3 days of expiration. This store is consistently out of stock of primary food items and only ever seems to be stocked with random selections that nobody is buying anyways. On top of that, the customer service is absolutely wild. The “veteran” employees are rude as hell and never seem to want to be useful in any type of way, and the kid employees are like deer lost in headlights when it comes to simple assistance. Compared to the new Bargersville location, I have no idea how this place is still in business other than the sheer convenience of location. Will only ever be stopping here for absolute grocery emergencies from now on."

Finally, we asked for a manager or to call someone.  The 2 employees chatting at the opposite side of the checkout yelled across the store to us we would just have to wait.  The older woman in the red vest was a little rude about it.
The 2 people in front of me just left.
I retreived a replacement for my damaged item. Then, I left the damaged item at the desk for them to figure out later.
If you ignore the customer long enough, they will eventually leave.; ABS💖LUTELY DELICI💖US! I am ALWAYS looking for good tasting gluten free stuff.

I think the add flyer in the paper is enough. I miss out on so many savings because of those stupid digital coupons. This is why I quit shopping at Kroger's after 50 years. Even with the coupon they give me I can still get it cheaper for the same brand at Walmart. And now that Kroger's is trying to buy Albertsons I don't see any prices going down anytime soon.

If you're in search of anything for your island function whether it be for a wedding, graduation, grand 75th or funeral this is a one stop shop. If he doesn't have what you need, he definitely knows someone who does. He has competitive prices. He's knowledgeable and kind. He has a stock of a lot of interesting items. Come down and check his store out. You'll find something that will peak your interest that's for sure. Come and support a good business in the Bay!; This is a small store with Caribbean, Hawaiian and island items. The owner is helpful and kind.

Although they have a variety of items is hard to see everything due to boxes covering most of the store. If you are looking for something in particular ask the staff.

They have a small selection of frozen items and produce, however most is in cans.; A great assortment of leis and products of many Islands throughout the world. I felt like I was in an island market place.; Very positive first experience here today. The very tiny store is a little overwhelming upon walking in because there is just so much in a tiny space, but great customer service. Fake flower, Kikui nut, and $ leis + Hawaiian shirts & swim trunks + frozen food from various islands among other canned food staples. Not my favorite brand of poi, Taro Brand, but they have it and are willing to help source other delicious items from the Hawaiian islands that aren't currently in stock. Nice find!; Very disappointed today asked the owner for ten pieces of pigs tail gave me eighteen pieces instead.I trusted him so waited till I got home to check it.There was also a lump of salt like two baseballs .!!! In the bag.Don’t trust anyone examine your stuff before you leave his shop.!!!"

Eat the World LA review:
Samoa is the birthplace of the second largest amount of people of Pacific Islander origin in the United States after only Hawai'i, with Los Angeles being the largest community of them on the mainland (Honolulu has more). If that sentence did not have enough fun facts in it for you, it is also worth noting that more Samoans now live in the US than in Samoa. Despite this, they leave a fairly small footprint in our area and it takes some tracking down as some restaurants and steam tables have closed over the years.

One place to find food prepared daily is at the back of a very nondescript strip mall on Western Avenue in Anaheim, once again proving the point that driving too fast is not only dangerous but a good way to miss the good stuff.

The shop sells colorful printed shirts, bags of chips and candy from Australia and New Zealand that must be available in Samoa, some fresh produce, and flags and other memorabilia. The main focus for us of course was the steam table and prepared foods, of which they have three sizes of meals depending on how hungry you are. The already gigantic lunch ($11.99) is technically the smallest but feeds three (non-islander noobs) and consists of taro and banana under a sausage (sosisi) on one half with lamb over a base of sapasui, or Samoan-style chow mein on the other.; Super nice people work here! Food in the hot plate looks good but we just bought some kalo to plant at home.; Come hungry one combo can easy feed 2-3 people; The food was so salty, overcooked, and hard, and taro looked like they were taro from two weeks ago. The most nastiest Polynesian food I’ve ever tasted. Wasted my money and my time here. I wish the one on Garden Grove Blvd has cooked food on week days."

La Hacienda has some good quality items but their checkout system is ridiculous, the quality inconsistent, and the prices are super premium compared to other options.

The hot food pickup at lunch time is like someone who has never seen a buffet restaurant or cafeteria designed it, and wants to target people taking food home instead of eating it onsite. Items range from $5.99 to $18.99 per pound so they force you to use many tiny containers instead of one. It’s difficult to know how much you’re getting so you always end up with way more than you can eat and you pay extra for all the little containers (and poor landfill!). The whole thing is chaos, and the routing to get to pay makes it worse. Complete shitshow sometimes but at least everyone maintains good social distancing. Please hire a proper cafeteria designer and charge a single price so we can fill a single lunch box to go!!! Lots and lots of cafeterias do this. You’re not special.

Also, the meat items are usually stale and dry and the brussel sprouts aren’t properly cut (have you tried chewing through the stem???).; The best; Gourmet place in the heart of the financial district.

Then, that's when he informs me ""you didn't tell me that there are 13"" and I tell him ""it's just that you ""he didn't ask me"" and he questions me ""you were supposed to tell me it was 13"" and he comments to an employee ""look it's 13, but he didn't tell me it's 13"" to which I come back and reply ""it's just that you didn't he asked me"" and the employee (to gain the boss's favor?) refers to my person to inform ""is that you are supposed to report it."" Given this discomfort with other clients watching, I decide to report that communication is not flowing and that I do not care to make copies there. Immediately afterwards, I try to tell the Manager some information and in an elevated tone of voice he decides to greet what appears to be an acquaintance, completely ignoring me. I have been processing copies in different places for a long time. This is why I can give suggestions in this regard:

1. When sending a document, the client can be next to the computer and the employee from the screen asks if that is the document.

2. Second, the employee asks if it is black and white or color.

3. Third, the employee asks if it is regular paper or some different type.

4. Fourth, the employee asks how many copies of each document.

5. Fifth, print one of each to check if you like it and avoid wasting more paper.

###This is how they have done it in other places with excellent service ###

It is a place where I usually shop at both the supermarket and the pharmacy. But I'm so upset that I don't know if I'll go back.

P.S. It is very close to where I live, but I think that instead of leaving my money here I will have to give it to an American multi-company for better treatment than ours."

I was speechless and they brought tears to my eyes ...... I know that my friends are going to absolutely love them !!! thank you fabulous Kroger Granbury bakery and the sweet person that made these gorgeous cupcakes!!!!!!; I'll start by saying that I love Kroger. Unfortunately I had a problem with a pick up  order last evening. I switched to pick up because of recent medical issues that prevent me from coming into the store. The order last night was to include two 12  packs of diet Dr Pepper that I purchased, plus get an additional two 12 packs free.Arriving home, the two free 12 packs were missing. When I called to arrange to pick up the two missing 12 packs I was told that i would have to come in to the service desk and get them. No exceptions. So I have to find a new grocery store because I cannot afford to pay for groceries that they fail to include with this order and possibly future orders. What a shame to have such a hard nose policy.; Just a quick question.  Why do the checkers refuse to sack the customer's groceries?  Is it expected that the customer sacks their own items?  Yes, of course in the self-check outline, but give me a break... when the checker just stands there and stares at the items until the customer sacks everything. This happens almost every single time I shop at this location. I am pretty well finished with the Kroger in Granbury, I can easily go across the street, get cheaper prices and someone to bag my purchases at HEB!; What is it with the pharmacy? Does it hurt to smile , be pleasant in person or on  the phone? The words thank you go a long way , give it a try!! Horrible customer service. Just got off the phone refilling prescriptions, when I was done giving the information, she said ok, I’ll send it to your Dr. , long pause, and then she just hung up! RUDE. This is NOT the first time with this pharmacy. The entire staff could use a refresh course on customer service. I can see from the reviews this is a repeat occurrence. Do better Kroger.; I have always known Kroger to be an upscale grocery chain, where the wealthy and classy shop. I would expect the restrooms to be clean. However, not at this location. The ladies restroom looks as if it is never cleaned. Toilet paper is strewn all over the floor, food particles are in the sinks, and the odor within the entire restroom is pungent, to say the least. Also, there are NO lights in the stalls. Quite eerie."

The customer service is outstanding, as any employee is eager to help. Ryan, the manager, was very accommodating. The produce is consistently fresh and artfully displayed. The bakery selections rival a French patisserie. The cheeses are fantastic. There's a nice deli with a wide variety of offerings. Shopping at Kowalski's is always a great experience!; I just began shopping at Kowalski's a little over a year ago because I moved closer to Grand. I love the store and its offerings. Overall, it's been a great experience.

Once, I had a bad experience with a cashier, but I talked to a manager about it. I tried to assure him that I wasn't contacting him to make a big deal about it or get the cashier in trouble. I felt that it was a training and racial sensitivity issue. He agreed, and that was that. I felt seen and respected after not feeling seen or respected. and I felt much better afterward.; Very quaint, clean , well stocked pleasant atmosphere.. their Deli rivals those in New York, which made this New York interloper very happy. But the rule that Boars heads New York cheddar, cannot be sold here is to die for..... .. that every Wisconsin and Minnesota cheese lovers would agree with .; Kowalski's market is a wonderful place to shop as far as I'm concerned it's a walkable store unlike Cub and Hy-Vee! They have an absolutel wonderful selection of meats and seafoods fresh produce, delicatessen, they have a comfortable seating area inside so you can enjoy something that you bought at the deli they also have outside seating and you can view beautiful White Bear lake while you eat, I live in Arden Hills and I like to drive there when the weather's nice and shop, it's a destination shopping experience for me I'm a simple man with simple taste but Kowalski's has better taste than I wonderful people wonderful store!; Okay, I like this store, but Thursday night at 7 p.m. someone went into my bag and stole $20. right near the salad bar.

Anywho, great grocery store, so clean and well organized. I recommend buying the kowalski’s brand Taco Seasoning and Original Chili Starter, they are sooo good! I stock up so I don’t have to be without it. You can add it to your soups, plain beans, etc. So delicious!; I ordered cupcakes for a U of MN job fair today and they were a huge hit! They were decorated to perfection with cows, pigs and chickens! The bakery manager was a huge help and so was the manager that helped carry them out. Thank you!; Great grocery store! It's always clean and tidy whenever we come in. The aisles are always clear and clean. Items in shelves are always well organized. Wished there were more authentic ethnic food sauces. It is very to navigate through too. Parking is very easy and I like how it's quite close to the store so you won't have to walk far at all. The hot foods are good for what they are. The prices of the food selections are a bit more but you can find cheaper alternatives. Overall, an excellent place to refill your water, grab snack, grab some meats, grab cakes and muffins and more. Employees are always nice as well AND there is a Starbucks in here too!; This  Kowalski's Market location is ALWAYS clean, organized and tidy. I have never gone in here and spotted a dirty area. It's crazy how clean it is. The employees are always nice and helpful. The food aisles are very easy to read and very well organized and always stocked. I've never had an issue finding something as the signs are very easy to read and if you do need something, employees are around to help. Prices are significantly higher than Cubs and other grocery stores. But you will be able find other brands that will fit your budget.

The meat department is my favorite as they have a fantastic selection for all budgets. The 40-day dry aged is my favorite and after purchasing a ton of the beef, chicken, pork, lamb, and various fish, I have never been disappointed! The produce is top notch and my wife swears by their large avocados. I love that Dave’s Killer Bread is not frozen and the cheese counter is impressive. Grateful to live close by to such a gem.; This was my first time in a Kowalski's Market, and I was here for one thing: artisan cheese. I've followed them on Instagram for over a year now and I knew they were supposed to have a good selection; I was delighted to confirm that yes, their cheese selection is fantastic, and yes, their cheesemongers are incredibly nice and helpful. Cheese is a serious hobby for me and I keep an extensive log, and I found more new cheeses here than I have found at any store in quite some time.

The one frustration was at the self check-out. One of my cheeses wasn't in the system and another didn't have a weight that the computer scale liked, so the young man overseeing the registers had to keep coming over to help. He was very nice, but I felt badly about the continued hassle.

I'd happily visit this and other Kowalski's locations for cheese! I should probably look around the rest of the store, too, because I'd probably find more things I liked.; This grocery store selection is a dream. The bakery section is huge and amazing. The healthy selection is top tier. They can make burgers, sushi and more on site. The customer service was alright.; It's one of the few Kowalski's that doesn't have a ramen and pho bar, which is very disappointing. The Kowalski's in excelsior which is about the same amount of distance has a ramen bar, but isn't on the Southwest prime route. Just outside of it, actually.

All the dining room tables were dirty! They seem like they had a good amount of employees, so someone definitely should be wiping off the dining room tables periodically. They had a good selection of sushi, but they didn't have much without tuna, which is very disappointing.; Nice high end grocery store. You will find some things here that you don't find in a regular grocery store. They have fresh seafood. Nice selection of produce. Bakery looks great. I only shop here for things I can't get at my regular grocery store. Prices are a little high."

It's nice for essentials and extras alike. I like the Starbucks inside the store. It's basically like Lunds and Byerly's, in my honest opinion.; Extremely overpriced now. I knew to just get small containers of several deli items, a roll for butter and the cheapest water bottle for $8. For dessert I was interested in a bakery item but settled on a $1.75 donut. The other bakery items are ridiculously high. Have to wonder how many pie and cake slices get tossed out after sitting in the case. Looks like they removed all those expensive gift items. They could do better in choice of guards. After my meal, I looked at the various remaining gift items, passed him, and headed to the restroom. He followed me and was waiting for me when I exited. After getting two small ice cream cups from the freezer, he continued to watch me, even as I went to the register. And for years I shopped in this store. It’s obvious Kowalskis is not performing well.; I believe this is one of the older locations from this brand, but they do an amazing job with keeping it fresh and looking great inside. The location is huge despite what it looks like outside, the building plays with the eye with its placement but inside it's huge. I saw a local musician entertaining the store, that is def a nod to how in-tune the establishment is to the community it's in. The shelves are stocked and you can find unique local items sold here. I think that's what puts Kowalski's in their own lane, they seem to work with local creatives over their peers. Parking lot can be stressful, coming off a busy street into a parking lot that isn't huge can be a lot for someone to handle. Overall experience was great, I will return and see what else I can find and talk about.; Love this place..the workers are so friendly and helpful..the manager, the main guy, is super awesome. I've seen him jump on registers, open up registers so I didn't have ti wait and he even carried my bags out for me once despite other 'inferior ' workers he could have called on. He's just a very well suited man for the job and probably has alot to do with why this kowalskisin particular is so awesome.; Always quality ingredients and friendly, helpful people. Best higher end grocery store in the area.  They now have a build your own pastar (closes at 8:30) which is excellent!  The New space is incredible."

They have better freshness (dated packages are significant).  Two people want 18  “Vital Farms” eggs to be great until they are used.

Target or Walmart.; Great store - especially like the deli and fresh packaged foods.
Miss the homemade sour dough bread - hope it’s back soon for my avocado toast. Like the regular chicken salad over the “ classic” too hard to made a sandwich with cubed chicken.; Brenda in deli was a great employee! She even offered me a free sample of the deli meat I ordered for a customer. I’m glad to see Kowalski’s hire generous employees such as Brenda.; Service is always great. Staff was friendly and helpful and smiled and said hello. I also love the little stick bun they offer in their bakery. :); My go-to store for groceries. Kowalskis has a beautiful environment, incredible customer service and so many amazing products. Their deli has the most amazing soups, sushi and salads. It costs more than other places like Cub Foods but totally worth it, in my opinion."

This place even has a restaurant and I think a hair salon… and their customer service can’t be beat.; They have, in my opinion,  the best Muenster cheese you can get in our area. The store is clean, the staff are friendly and it's just a great establishment. It's a little pricier than walmart or Cub, but it's well worth the money spent.; This is our favorite local market.  The staff is always super nice and helpful.  I recommend the protein bites as a treat.  They have a Starbucks in the store.  The deli, cheese shop, and olive bar are well maintained and full of delicious goodies.  There's also a Pezzo Pizza restaurant.; Top tier grocery store and shopping experience.

I'll return to see what else I can experience here.; Always clean, great options, friendly helpful staff. Love the food options too and they have Starbucks inside.

This store is a haven for anyone looking to improve their overall health with delicious and nutritious options.

One of the standout features is their incredible range of energy teas and smoothies. Each drink is made with high-quality ingredients that are not only tasty, but also full of health benefits. I tried their Ocean Breeze Energy Mega Tea and one of their baked cakes, and both were absolutely refreshing and energizing.

The staff at The Bloom Place is knowledgeable and friendly. They were more than happy to explain the benefits of different ingredients and help me choose the best options based on my health goals.

The atmosphere of the store also deserves mention. It's clean, bright and welcoming, making it a perfect place to relax and enjoy a healthy snack. Whether you're a health enthusiast or just looking for a tasty way to improve your diet, The Bloom Place is definitely worth a visit.

Service at Plaza Loíza is usually very good but there have been moments when the customers have complained about the  shortage of merchandise packaged for the use of the seniors who make up the majority of the shoppers who live in these neighborhoods. That issue was addressed by the local Consumer Affairs Department and one serving cans of fruits  and vegetables reappeared and are available for us. Some of these senior citizens live alone or take care of their spouse or grandchildren.
The store has fresh and frozen vegetables as well as fresh and frozen meats as well as Fri,em goods that just have to be heated up like lasagna, pasta dishes and pi,was as well as others.
Household goods like laundry supplies, soap, fabric softener and other cleaning supplies like sponges, dish cloths, mops, mop sticks, brooms and broomsticks and buckets are also on sale.
The selection of seafood is usually great and some owners of places that prepare food to sell at their small businesses buy large quantities of seafood and chicken, pork and beef. Plaza Loiza is known for its selection of  of available seafood.
Unless the heat wave has affected the rate at which food cans rust there may be a shortage of food on the island soon.
I know the store in Reparto has generators that they used after María but the recent heat wave and recent blackouts and brownouts may have affected the shelf life of some of the products sold.
I'm very thankful that they have had a good supply of ice to resell during the last month.
The store was able to replace the old refrigerated display cases and frozen foods display cases with new ones over the last couple of years.
The Reparto Plaza Loíza is one if the stores that had added a small area where cooked food can be purchased during the advertised hours. At the moment, this service might not be available due to the brownouts and blackouts
For pictures of what is available in the store this week's shopper should be available on their website since they also offer to deliver what one chooses to buy online.; It is a nice and cozy place that has most of the regular items you'll need for cooking, the staff is super friendly and helpful. There's plenty of parking in front of the store, but remember you'll enter through one entrance then you'll have to drive to the end of the parking lot to exit; Nice small mall.

I love this place.

6/10/2024
If u are vegan or vegetarian or international people, u need to come here to shop. I love this place. Today I got my love:dragon fruit, Chineseeggplant, Thai banana, and lychee. ;); One of the best gricery stores in the entire US. The produce is very fresh and the prices are very very reasonable. Highly recommended.; Definitely cheapest in the valley for fruits, vegetables and certain groceries. They have food from Middle East, East Asia and South America. Because it’s a popular store checkout lines are long and parking is tight. But if you want to save money and wouldn’t mind waiting a bit longer this is definitely the place; You have to see their fresh produce department. Incredible deals, but so many choices! The deli meats are fresh and beautiful, and be sure to get their prepackaged ""nazook"". Super King reminds me of Gelson's, but with great prices and many choices if you like foods from around the globe. A definite ""must try"".; Smells bad. Unfortunately. I believe one of the first signs of rot and decay is the smell. The meat department smelled like rotting meat and sewage build up. Rust or wet metals. Like when you take an old wet rag and try to use it to clean. Kinda gross.

Granted they do have a variety of foods from all across the globe I just hope that where it counts they purchased locally. Like produce. From when I first walked in was in awe of the different varieties of produce that you don't usually see in chain markets, but that's what makes it interesting. Not great just interesting.

Reading other reviews it's common to hear this place has questionable decision making. But use common senses when purchasing food. Trust your eyes, noes and gut.

I would've like to make this place my goto market, and will give it a few more tries, but currently I'll travel a little farther for quality."

They have also resorted to locking merchandise behind cabinets in many areas creating an inconvenience not just for store staff but also for consumers who have to wait long periods of time in order to get something.

One positive, lots of parking.; There's an African American lady maybe in her 30's also another lady in her 50s has the outer self check out machines always closed. I asked the younger one of the two why she always has them closed, and she says that they are broken but doesn't know what's wrong with them. It's obvious that she's lying. It's very inconvenient for the customers having to wait when there are perfectly fine u scan machines not being utilized.  She also always has a mean demeanor about her. Never smiles, never greets or thanks.  Nightmare of an employee  representing your company. Very bad experience.; Absolutely the worst grocer in the area, by far. If I could give them 0 stars, I would. Never any handcarts available, forcing you to use carts and rack up the bill. Fewer and fewer lanes open every week, forcing the customer to use self checkout, even though the savings from hiring people doesn't seem to make it down to the consumer. Produce is severely lacking in selection and more often than not well past it's expiration point (walked in for some oranges last week and most of them were rotten). Shelves regularly empty. Just absolutely awful. I only come here when I absolutely have to but I'm ust start planning better and going elsewhere going forward.; I only shop here because it's close and walkable. If I'm driving or stocking up on more then a bag or two worth of stuff I'll often go elsewhere.

The store itself is a bit on the smaller side for a Vons. Often missing the item I came specifically for. Sometimes as simple and common as a Dr Pepper or a gallon of milk. Prices aren't great and specials are often a dollar higher per pound then you can find in the advert you can grab from the front of the store. They've stopped carrying products I used to get. Store is often understaffed at busy times creating long lines.

The self checkout... I have never been to another store ever that has the volume on these stupid machines set so high. The self checkout machines are basically screaming at you. Additionally half the payment hubs at the self checkout are trash. Anybody with older magnetic strip only cards, Vons club cards, EBT cards, etc will probably encounter errors.

Now for the shopping center area in general... oh boy. The responsibility of a lot of this is going to fall to the landlord or the area or even the city but you may have to deal with these issues here non the less.

Parking lot is WAY to large. So while you'll always find parking it's also just a giant dirty asphalt soul sucking heat well with lots of wasted space. No trees, no shade. Ground in general looks like the last time it was pressure washed was a decade ago.

The two trash cans out front are always overflowing and gross. The one on the North side entrance was set on fire at some point and there's still melted plastic and multiple dried sodas on the ground from months ago. Probably not a big deal to most but I'll often ride my bike and or bring my dog when I walk. And since there's no longer a bike rack these disgusting trash cans are the only place to lock a bike or leash my dog to while I go inside.

Which leads to the last issue. There are some real screwed up metal homeless drug addicts hanging around this area. I mean surprise surprise it's California and this is getting worse all over. But here's the issues I've had with crazies at this shopping center: Man by the paint store pulled a knife and threatened to kill me in the middle of the afternoon because he said MY DOG LOOKED at him wrong or some literal paranoid insanity like that. The lawn south of the Vons a completely different man was threatening to fight me, then challenged the dog to a fight, and then challenged several shadow people to duels in which he assured these non existent people he would be victorious against. And numerous times I've seen people smoking meth near the gap in the wall along Dearborn and the paint store in broad daylight. I guess this is just something you are allowed to do now in this state.

Security will run off the crazies when they can but they can't be everywhere all the time. If you come here on foot or bike I highly suggest carrying pepper spray or something else that you can defend yourself with.; Antem debit card works here!! Try so many stores to buy groceries. Glad I didn't have to use the app. I saved money shopping in person. Was very nice and clean in the store. Found everything I wanted."

They also forgave me for breaking some eggs all over the floor one day and replaced all the broken ones.

I have never been disappointed with their avocado selection (or any of the produce) for taco Tuesday (or any day)! Not to mention this is a family owned and operated business, so the level of service and care is always there. I have been coming here for 9 years and can only say great things about this market! ❤️; I stopped shopping at this grocery store since I read that they complained about the closure of Barrow Street. They pretend the closure of the street is affecting their business. What a non sense. Closing this street was an absolute necessity. Now Newark av pedestrian mall is striving. This is selfish behavior. By requesting the reopening of the street (the store is not even on that street) it means they don't care for their customers. They don't care of public interests and quality of life they only focus on old fashioned car only urban development.  If their business is failing it is not because of the street closure, it is because whole foods opened and mostly because of nearby store Oliva has more choices and way cheaper price.  I recommend everyone to shop at Oliva instead of depressing P&K store.; Hands down the best flower selection in Jersey City along with a really great and curated grocery offering.

Stopped by to have a quick Coffee with a friend, and they have some decent options for Cold and Hot Beverages. Coffee and Lemonade that we ordered was pretty good. One major drawback is that the Checkout line is same for regular shoppers checking out items from the Market, as well as for those who are just ordering from the Deli. We had to wait in line for along with the other shoppers just to place our orders. I hope they change this.; If you do shop here, make sure you watch the prices when they scan your items. They often post lower prices on the shelves that do not match the scanned prices. I raised the issue to the cashiers and they refused to honor the advertised price. Something about ""we have no control over what the stockers do with the price tags"". Sounds illegal but ok.; We live in 70 Green St and used to go to this market every day at the beginning. But the truth is they got very poor quality control of fresh goods. We bought watermelon that had super bad smell and a coconut that was too old and didn’t have any coconut water inside. We tried to communicate with the manager and I was told their policy didn’t allow customer to either have an exchange or refund. If you get something of bad quality from their store, it’s just ironically bad luck and they cannot do anything about it. Just go to WholeFoods if you live nearby.; Best place ever for small meals and grocery! Produce quality is always so gooood; ""The deli here is really good. There are a lot of options to choose from and the people who make it are cool and friendly;always having a smile on their faces. As for the hot food, it is also tasty and again a lot of options to choose from. It's like getting a home cook meal without having to do the work. Also the sushi here is great. The sushi chef is very creative with the type of sushi he makes. Some are even more healthier making sushi with brown rice instead of white rice.

The store itself is a great store to buy from. There are a lot of products for people who are gluten free, dairy free, etc. most are organic products. I love how they have a lot of international products that are hard to fine in other stores."""

I recently had a frustrating experience with a purchase that left me feeling misled and dissatisfied. I bought a fan for $410 and opted for the $279 next-day early delivery service, expecting it to arrive as promised. Unfortunately, the fan didn't arrive until three days later, causing me to miss a scheduled appointment with a technician that I had arranged for the following day.

When I reached out to customer service to request a shipping refund due to this delay, I was met with an unhelpful response. They claimed that since I placed the order on Friday, it was expected to arrive by Monday. However, nothing in the checkout process indicated that there would be a delay, which felt incredibly misleading.

Despite my attempts to explain the situation and convince them of the unfairness, my request for a refund was outright rejected. This entire experience has left me with a sense of dishonesty regarding their delivery promises. I expected better communication and service, especially given the premium price I paid for expedited shipping.

In summary, this experience has been disappointing, and I cannot recommend this service based on my encounter. If you value timely delivery and transparency, you may want to think twice before making a purchase here.; Rude customer service. Had a defective part sent to me and they had to do a warranty claim. No follow up when you try to email to get information. When you call they are rude and no help. Tell me to just order another part while I wait to see what they will do. Meanwhile losing money with equipment down. Horrible company and rip offs. Won’t ever use them for any of our businesses again.; Did someone really complain they used a part and couldn't return it?  Ridiculous.

These guys have been more than helpful every time I have contacted them.  I give them the model tag of some hobart equipment and an obscure picture of a part I need and they get it done.  I am not sure what more you can ask for.; Not a good company to order parts from. Ordered a part it came in I no longer needed that part so I returned it, they sent me photos of it being used which yes I did try it and didn’t end up keeping it. They sent me an email saying I have to send them a return label in order for them to send it back to me I told them I would pay for the return label. They said no we cannot do that. Just before two weeks they gave me 3 days or else my part would be destroyed. Honestly all the part needed was some cleaning inside and it would be like it was new again. Never will I order from them again!!; Received the incorrect part. Called to get a resolution. Was told that I need to contact the company they outsourced the product to. You are the place I made the order with, you fix the issue. Nothing more than a middle man soaking a % off the system. Original equipment if it looks like the picture… 🤣🤣🤣"

They have an abundance of generally outdated goods, so we had to go back and return the items we had bought, and when we did, the woman who was helping us was unapologetic.

Much Respect, Jennifer🙂; Great grocery store. The meats are fresh and nice priced. Staff is very nice and friendly. Prices are great and reasonable. Highly recommended.; They have great prices and friendly employees and some pretty good deals. I will be back 😁; Decent place to shop. Bought a family pack of 1 inch pork chops . Looks bigger than picture. Also hamburger 4.34 lbs 73/27  $11.24. also breakfast sausage 3/$10.00 definitely deal. They have po boys couple bucks for lunch. Go buy see what deal you find.; It's close, and they usually have what I need, BUT: the store never looks clean, it's old & rundown, and I'm not sure the freezer and refer units are up to par.

Extremely polite, helpful, and professional staff. 100/10.; Wow! What a great store. Wide variety of produce, beef, pork, sausage, chicken, deli, cheeses and more. Very kind, friendly, and eager to help staff. Great products, great prices and they seem to have everything a foodie might want. I'm sure I'll be back.; I love the store everything is very good quality. The only problem I have is with the recent change of the sushi bar. The new bar looks like quantity over quality. It has bad avocado in the rolls. The one I did try tastes like a mass produced sub par roll. The rice is mushy and tasteless which is should have a mild flavor and have some bite to it not straight unflavored mush. I def won't be getting anymore sushi from here they ruined it with this new company they put in. Other than that the store is awesome.; This is a great place to shop. I love stopping here for something I need. There is a great selection of foods, my favorite is the deli which serves boars head brand meats."

Their staff are friendly, their selection is immaculate. The amount of fresh and hard to find ingredients is delightfully shocking. I shop there as often as i can.

Only complaint is limited number of green vegetables and root vegetables available."

My nephew recommended after eating here and he was spot on. Take it from a true steak snob and carnivore that was the best steak I’ve ever eaten. Beautiful cut, seasoned to perfection and delicious to the last bite. Fried portobello mushrooms to start us off were also a home run! If you’re in the area it’s definitely worth a visit. Quaint and homey place with amazing staff and food! Definitely coming back to test some other menu items!; Very friendly and great service we had a Hamburger 🍔 and a Cheese burger 🍔 w/ season fries very good.also finding out that they have Pineapple & Brown sugar sausage..and Sausage Frank's.. They are highly recommended..
Soon I shall find out..
10/16/2023 stopped in for another cheese burger 🍔
And picking up some mid and jalapeno and cheese homemade sausage 🌭.
Steak fingers were on the buffet today..

.; Very good pork chop plate lunch.  Haven't tried the store made sausage I bought yet.; The ribs here may be the best I have ever tasted. Holy moly.; This place has been around for years. This grocery needs a 10 star rating.  I love the customer service.  The young lady (cashier) was wonderful.  We were greeted with a smile.  Every question that we'd asked had been answered quickly and with accuracy.  The sausage is soooooooooo good.    We LOVE it.  Can't get enough. If you really knew me....you would know that I do not eat just any thing.   EVERYONE should try it.  It is seasoned to perfection.  Not too salty.  Not too hot.  Tastes Just right."

Everyone was in a marvelous magnificent mood. The store had an awesome amazing atmosphere. The managers were magnificent. The employees were spectacular. The customer service was wonderfully wonderful. Everyone deserves a trophy because they are a terrific team. Happy, blessed, joyful New Year’s to this store.; This store is so awesome they have great foods sold their and the people that work there are extremely nice and knowledgeable about what they have; Prices are always thrifty, clerks friendly, well organized and very clean. Definitely recommend!; I love that this store is in front of my complex it is so easy to call them when I'm hungry to order some food and yes the food is good.  I go up there and get my cigarettes and drinks and if I missing anything that I forgot to buy the grocery store it's they have it. I just have to walk to the front of the complex to get what I'm missing they are a little pricey but it is worth every penny.; Overall I will admit it's a bit on the pricey side, but a small nuisance considering the overall prices of ANYTHING and EVERYTHING nowadays no matter where you shop. I at least get the comfort and feeling of the way it used to be shopping at the local grocer in a small town. The staff are always friendly, and just as helpful when needed. Another comfort, which can never be overrated, is the fact that it never seems overly crowded so the visits are pleasant, and the staff never feel overwhelmed. The only thing that does worry me about that is I really don't want to see them go under from lack of sales the way other such small/independent businesses have. It's a shame supporting local doesn't seem to be of much concern for most anymore. Everything has either gone the way of big chain store shopping or online delivered right to you laziness. I still enjoy good customer service and smiling faces during my transactions... I guess I'm more ""old school than I thought"" 🤷🏼"

1. Store Format: No-frills, cost-effective.
2. Product Selection: Limited, focuses on essentials.
3. Pricing: Competitive, emphasis on quality and low prices.
4. Shopping Experience: Pretty Streamlined and efficient.
5. Customer Service: Lean staffing model, self-bagging

My wife and I feel that some of the items sold at this location are comparatively cheaper and better than in other places. Overall, this store provides good customer experience.; This store is becoming extremely dirty over time. The produce section is filled with fruit flies/gnats and 75% of it all is moldy. The eggs and milk section are always full of cracked eggs or spilled milk because the caps aren’t ever sealed properly. I’ve been coming here for years, I used to love it so much that I drive past two other Aldi stores (that are gross too) just to shop here, but now I will be needing to go to another one or finding another store all together to purchase my groceries.; I love this place.  Under same business umbrella as Trader Joe's but different business model.  You bring your own bags, do your own bagging, return your own cart to corrale, and now mostly do self checkout.  Smaller store with more focused product selection.  All to keep prices low.; This Aldi location is within a very busy strip mall area.  I find it best to visit outside of rush hour, or any work day and confine my visits to Saturday morning and Sunday.  The parking lot is usually very busy but there are adequate parking spaces.  The traffic on the entry road is a difficulty.  It is relatively easy to enter if you are travelling east on Ford Road but going west can be a hassle.

I like the selections they have, especially their health oriented materials.  The prices are right for the food I would term ‘health’ food.  Like whole grains.  The inside of the store is very plain.  It is easy to navigate to the several sections.  Like a traditional supermarket it is not a gargantuan warehouse.  They are very busy so the staff is actively moving materials from the storage area to the sales area at a regular pace.

The last time I was there I was concerned because electric forklifts were being used to move produce and items out to the floor rather than transferring them to carts.  The location also lacked sufficient boxes to place the food and other goods we purchased in (which is the custom at the place).  We ended up buying reusable bags, so, that worked out.; Girl workin on floor was racist..i asked her where honey was n stuff, u can tell she didn't wana help at all, she just shook her head nat a word then i was behind her, she stepped on my foot, said excuse me she turns luks at my face n regrets saying excuse me u can tell n thats it she didn't ask me if was ok iam sry nothing, iwas hurt though...n i see her laughin saying i am sry to other ppl of her own race for no reason but since iwas asian iwas treated totally differently i was regular shopper at aldi but nat anymore hate racism"

First experience in one and I just didn't see or feel the hype.; Gives off similar vibes to a Busch’s, but with SO much more variety. I’m both gluten and dairy free and I’ve never seen so much variety for both in my life. They even have gluten free gum. I’m super impressed. Place was really clean. Worker was super nice. Best grocery store sushi I’ve ever had, and the best price. Large variety of natural soaps and CBD products as well.

I told him I didn’t I used my card. I go inside to talk to the man at the register and he said that “the man said pump 10 when he meant 12 so that’s not my problem you can deal with that.” When I told him I didn’t take his gas the man at the counter says “I know” So he STOLE from the him. People in the store were so shocked that they offered me money to give to the guy outside. I WILL NEVER come back.; Do not stop here. The service is bad and the gas is low quality.; Gas maybe cheap but burns fast , workers always seem under the influence of something or just plain out rude. I'd be weary of the food after seeing the restroom .; Just left this store a few minutes ago and the customer service is terrible. I purchased gas and the guy behind the counter entered it wrong which he canceled the sale. He then rung the sale up again which I swiped my card and he cashed out which resulted in my card being charged. I informed him of the error and he admitted of the mistake but did nothing about it. Another worker came out of nowhere who was nowhere near when the transaction was made. Argued with me that my card was not charged while at the same time I’m showing him physically where my card had just been charged. I ended up leaving this store without a refund or my gas. I’ve been to this location a few times and every time I go there it’s always long lines, people who don’t even work there mingling behind the counter talking to the cashiers. I do not recommend this location to anyone that’s traveling esp if you’re in a hurry. Cashiers are rude at times with terrible attitudes like they don’t want to be there. Why choose a job that requires customer service if you don’t like people. Tonight was my worst experience ever and I seriously doubt I’ll ever visit this store again. I would rather take my chances elsewhere.; They are falsely advertising their products. It clearly says 2 for 99 cents on their products and refuse to honor that and instead charge 1.68 a piece. The only gas station on the coast to do this. And they have fixed it for me before but the same guy has a major attitude this time even though last time he didn’t understand why it was ringing up for  that higher price. They scam people and have zero remorse especially the manager. She ripped the signs down this time that said 2 for 99 cents."

Market House is a full service grocery store with several other businesses (a hardware store. Bank, pizza, coffee and pharmacy) located inside.
Clean and well stocked one star deduction for high prices (yes I know it is a small town); I’ve lived in this town for about six years and I would say 99% out of 100 times that I’ve went into the market House I had to deal with a disrespectful rude uncourteous cashier even though most of them are young ladies, and maybe it’s their parents fault for not teaching them respect and morals. Something needs to be done because if you can’t be nice and courteous to people as a cashier, you should get another job instead of spreading misery because your life sucks.; For being a small grocery store they have a lot of good choices though they're prices and items that are not on sale are much higher than Myers or other grocery stores in Adrian. why is that. This is a small town that can't afford higher prices than the supermarkets around them including me; Not as good as other trips. I went in for the donut holes, but there weren't any. Other bakery items were dated or very close.
Like the way the store is set up though, I enjoy the trip from Temperance.
Return: yes; Pros: I’d like to start off by saying the employees are very nice, polite and helpful.

Cons: Most of the items they have expire within a month or two if not days/weeks ( unlike Meijer, Kroger and Walmart). They have had issues with their freezer for almost a year and whenever I shop there, there are icicles hanging from the products. Pretty sure that’s a health department violation.

It’s overpriced for the generic brands they sell and the cost in some cases is 50% higher then that of the previous stores I mentioned. I’ve spoken with this “Brett” person who is on the receipt to call if you have issues or concerns but he just  blows you off and does nothing. The ancestors who handed the store down to him would be disappointed because he doesn’t give the quality of customer service they did when they built the business. Very sad indeed"

With its large and well-organized stores, Home Depot offers a wide range of products for all your home improvement needs. From tools and hardware to appliances and furniture, you can find everything you need under one roof.

However, while the store itself is impressive, the assistance to customers at Home Depot often leaves a lot to be desired. It's not uncommon to encounter difficulties in finding knowledgeable staff members who can provide the necessary guidance and support. This can be frustrating, especially when you need help with specific products or projects.

On the bright side, Home Depot has made strides in improving its online ordering and curbside pickup services. Many customers have had positive experiences with these options, allowing them to conveniently shop from the comfort of their homes and pick up their purchases without having to navigate the busy store aisles. This is particularly helpful in areas where parking and high traffic around the store can be challenging.

Speaking of the surrounding area, Home Depot locations are often strategically situated near restaurants and other stores, making it a convenient destination for budget-minded individuals. You can combine your home improvement trip with a meal or visit other stores to fulfill your various shopping needs.

One thing you can always count on at Home Depot is finding good deals. The store regularly offers discounts, promotions, and clearance sales, allowing you to save money on your purchases. Additionally, many Home Depot locations have fast-food options nearby, providing a quick and convenient dining solution during your shopping trip.

It's worth noting that peak hours at Home Depot can get busy, with increased foot traffic and longer wait times at checkout. If possible, planning your visit during off-peak hours may help you navigate the store more efficiently and avoid crowds.

In summary, Home Depot is a popular choice for home improvement needs due to its large and organized stores. While customer assistance can be lacking, the convenience of online ordering and curbside pickup options has been a positive experience for many. The surrounding area offers additional shopping and dining options, catering to budget-conscious shoppers. With regular deals and various fast-food choices nearby, Home Depot provides a comprehensive shopping experience. Just be aware of peak hours, as they tend to be busier.; Mostly love going to the Marshalls at this plaza.  It's always stocked with so much to choose from.  Good deals.

It complies not only with the rules for cleaning and distancing for the public, but also with the protections for the workers. I will definitely come back!; We were very excited when we found our pie crust. However, we made a fatal mistake when we bought the sushi. It was absolutely horrendously  disgusting. The sushi tasted old, the rice was undercooked, and they used smoked salmon. Not only that, they only gave us five small pieces of ginger.

Upon eating our first piece of what we thought would be a nice snack, we very quickly realized it was anything but that.  We bravely gave it a second try and my daughter ended up spitting it out, because  she just couldn't stomach another piece.  I however, decided to tough it out and immediately regretted it for the next 15 minutes as my mouth tingled and I desperately searched for a water bottle in my car to wash away the aftermath left behind from this putrid specimen of sushi. Whatever you do just skip the sushi at Pueblo in Guaynabo. It was not worth the $6.79!"

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by friendly and helpful staff who were eager to assist me with any questions or concerns I had. Their commitment to providing outstanding customer service was evident throughout my visit.

One aspect that particularly impressed me was the cleanliness of the store. The aisles were well-organized, and the shelves were fully stocked, making it easy to find everything I needed. It's evident that Kroger takes great pride in maintaining a clean and inviting store environment, which makes the shopping experience all the more pleasant.

What truly sets Kroger apart, though, is its dedication to sourcing locally grown and produced food. It's clear that Kroger values supporting local farmers and suppliers, as evidenced by the wide variety of locally sourced products available. This not only benefits the community by promoting local businesses but also ensures that the food is fresh and of high quality.

Overall, my experience at Kroger was fantastic. The exceptional customer service, clean store environment, and commitment to locally sourced food make it a standout grocery store in my book. I look forward to continuing to shop at Kroger and highly recommend it to others seeking a top-notch shopping experience.; Placed an online order to be picked up between 4-5. Get notification at 3pm order is ready so I go to pick up. It won’t let me tell them I am there around 3:40pm. So, I decided to wait until 4pm. Employee comes to my window and says oh I can check you in inside then I’ll bring out your order. He goes and comes back says actually your order isn’t finished it won’t be finished until between 4:30-5pm as we are an hour behind. He says we will have someone call when it’s ready. I say ok. I drive all the way home. Wait until after 5pm. I call 3 times and get no one to answer in the grocery pick up. So, I drive in because I have things to get done and need things in this order. I pull in complete check in only for another employee to come out and tell me it will be another 1-2 hours. I tried to call to speak to a manager. The phone got transferred and just rang and rang. This is the worst customer service. Like communication of delays and the inaccuracy of how far behind they are. Stop taking so many orders if you can’t complete them. I wouldn’t have been as upset if someone just answered/called before I made multiple drives and wasted time and gas.; I love shopping at Westfield Kroger, I find myself shopping here more often than other grocery chains because of the personalized service. I always go to self check, and I can count on there being a familiar face. My favorite cashier is Parool. I see how personable she is with everyone. I see her taking time to talk to the moms and make the kids feel noticed. She’s so helpful, and I see her as the beacon of friendliness and light. I don’t often see others taking so much pride in making the customers feel welcome in today’s world. If she’s not there, I always go and get in line on the other side so I can say hi to Ina, she recognizes a lot of customers and interacts with them with her amazing warm smile. Kroger thank you for employing, warm genuine souls.; I was so upset today.  My groceries were bagged so ridiculously.  I had brought in 3 reusable bags.    One of the bags was packed so heavy I could barely lift it into my car.  In that bag it had a bag of cubed ham, bag of long grain rice, bag of brown sugar,  lb of bacon,  lunch meat, butter, 2 pkg of cheese, 2 bags of instant mashed potatoes, cake mix, 6 cans of vegetable’s and 2 large jars of spagetti sauce.  The other bag had a loaf of bread , large container of cottage cheese, and a bottle of creamer.  The other bag wasn’t used.   I would like to know if they ever trainer the baggers how to bag.; I just really want to shout out to the Kroger pick-up/pickers/ loaders on 161st St Kroger in Westfield for always making it a really great experience. I have used this service for a really long time. They are very hardworking people and super kind/genuine about out of stock options and they really do try their best. I am disabled and use this service to assist me and my family multiple times a month. It helps me provide to my family when at times I am not able. These workers are very much needed and should be appreciated in our community."

Tuna was outstanding. The 2 ladies in the store are amazing. I love the service provided by both. Thanks; 20/10 Alan's Market is an absolute gem!

Their seafood selection is unparalleled, boasting the freshest and finest products I've ever come across here on the island.

I was thrilled to find items I've been searching for months, all under one roof.

The experience was nothing short of amazing.

I can confidently say I won't be purchasing seafood from anywhere else ever again.

Highly recommend!; Nice small fish shop.

They almost always have fresh tuna and salmon, often time have other type of fishes, whole or filés. Sometimes they have clams and oysters.

They also have so many other things for sale than fish. They have a small Asian side, with sushi rice, seaweeds and seasonings, plum sauce, sriracha etc.

They are one of the rare shop where I could find most of the time a French style cream ( crème fraîche) which is significantly better as a base for the homemade sauces.

They have some frozen selection of spring rolls, endamame, ravioli, shrimps, mussels etc.

Especially during Christmas or other occasions, they sale caviar, and caviar gift packs.

You can order online, or go to the shop. They have a parking lot. There is often time a wait that can be long as the shop is small with not much staff.

I would say sometimes it could be more fresh especially for the price; but overall it’s probably one of the best option here in PR if you don’t buy directly to a fisherman.
I would recommend!; Fully stocked with imported goods and the best fresh fish and seafood, also at good prices!"

I haven't tried their pizza, deserts, or shopped for groceries yet, but I had the D'Angelo Signature and it hit every box. It was made fresh and prepared quickly. They offer so many groceries and have a great ambiance. If you need any Italian food for lunch, this is the place to be.; Phenomenal environment!! The staff came around and asked my team and I how the food was, and were very pleased to hear how much we enjoyed it. All the pastas, sandwiches, drinks, pastries, etc. were all delicious. Highly recommend this spot for anyone in the Princeton area!!; Staff is extremely rude and quite frankly bizarre. Tried to order a large pizza pie and was told "" I can't do that"" by counter person. When I asked why her even more rude counterpart begins to excoriate me because they are working on an order of 20 pies for someone and how dare I expect them to drop what they are doing to make me a pie (as if I am supposed to know this somehow). It gets better! As I begin to walk out she says you can wait if you want but it will be thirty minutes, but then advises they actually can't because they ran out of pizza dough. I will never ever shop at this place again as long as I live. Awful customer service.; Service was good, large selection of salads and Italian food. Prices are reasonable. The only reason I'm not give them 5 starts is because of my sandwich... I ask for sausage parmigiana Hero and the sausage taste good, but the bread was testing awful, old bread... also it was very messy, my wife ask for tortellini pesto salad and that one taste great! Seems the bread thy are using is for days before... I will give them another try and will see if they take in consideration this review!; I always liked their pizza, sandwiches, pasta, and deli dishes. Wish they had working wifi. Prices are high. Has student discount.

Their vodka pasta is excellent. I think they have a lot more flavor than Olives.

Their pizza is superior to Proof but inferior to Pizza Den if you want crispy NY style.

Their sandwiches are far superior to Proof’s soggy mess, and higher quality than Hoagie, but sometimes you need a Hoagie calorie bomb.

Today I had a custom sandwich with grilled chicken, mozzarella, balsamic, and roasted red peppers on a roll for $13. It was excellent, and I was delighted that the gentleman toasted the sandwich for me to melt the cheese. Normally, their sandwiches are cold and can be either hoagies, on a roll, or wrap. No paninis here.

Look at the size of my Gnocchi for $13!

These guys all speak Italian and are clearly from Italy. Not so at Olive’s."

Otherwise, decent shopping experience.the store is generally clean, well staffed, and employees are helpful and courteous.; This is an above-average Kroger location. The “Marketplace” designation seems to signal more choice and more upscale options.

There are still plenty of items on sale, and all of the regular stuff offerings that you would expect.

Has fresh sushi, with deals every Wednesday. Also has a Starbucks, fresh flowers and a great wine selection.

Parking is easy and plentiful. There is a fuel center on site.

I only wish this store was closer to my goiter.; This place has a very good selection of grocery items, which is the second place I would go to after jungle jims. Beware of the sashimi sushi available. It was new so I got some for $10. I got home to eat it and was hugely disappointed. I got a mouth full of strong fish taste and the slices were so thick that the fibers on the filled gave it an unpleasant tough feel with each bite. Waste of $10.; I was picking up a fridge from Best Buy at 9845 Colerain Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45251, to help my son move into his dorm ( UC) . Afterward, I went to Kroger to do some grocery shopping and spent $190. I paid the cashier,  I accidentally pushed my cart with a bad wheel through a door that wasn’t marked as an exit. A white man and woman told me, ‘“ it is not an exit.” I was already outside, so I asked if they wanted me to go back. The man responded, “Just don’t do it again.” I told them I didn’t live here, but I understood.
As I was unpacking my groceries, a police officer, along with the same two people, showed up and said there was “suspicious activity”. I was asked to provide my receipt. This experience reminded me of how, despite the assumptions some people make, not every Black person is a thief, just like not every cop is a killer. It was a frustrating reminder of how differently things could have played out if I were white. Just incredibly sad!; Been going over 5 years nearly every week. Easy parking and entrance. Some foods are high and others are cheap. It's a treasure hunt. The signs that tell what's in the aisles need to be closer to eye level rather than wait up high or better yet a 2nd sign that is at the end of the aisles right above the refrigerators. Has a pharmacy and 5th/3rd bank. Very clean."

He always helps me when I come in the store with a positive friendly respectful demeanor. I am so glad they hired this guy.; TL;DR - Do not go to this Safeway, or go and expect the checkout process to be dreadful. Also, be careful of being overcharged.

I never saw myself writing a review for a local grocery store, because normally all of my visits are quick ins and outs. However, my visit to this Safeway was by far the most unusual and memorable (in a bad way) grocery experience I have ever had in my 20 years in the U.S. After shopping (about 10 items), I went to the self checkout area (about a 2 minute wait) and started checking out. After I scanned all of the items, I entered my phone number to the keypad and waited for the discounts to be removed from the total before the final total shows up on the screen. However, none of my clipped deals came through and somehow the total was $20 higher (doubled) than expected. I called over the on-duty self checkout staff for assistance. After reviewing my coupons and my membership on my phone, instead of manually adjusting the total, he said the entire transaction had to be voided, and I had to start scanning everything all over again. I was told that this time I MUST scan my QR code membership instead of my phone number and I must scan it before I scan all of my items. Well, guess what? The second time didn't work either. The staff member apologized and said I now have go to an actual cashier to check out.

So 15 minutes were wasted, I was once again in line for a live cashier to check me out... for the third time. Did I hear third time is the charm? I thought so too, but no! Even the cashier had problems and had to go get the manager to override the prices. 10 more minutes later, I FINALLY left the store with my groceries paying the correct price.

Moral of the story: look at the screen carefully as you are being checked out; make sure all of your clipped deals are applied to the transaction, or else you'll be charged double without you even noticing.; If you do not have the proper packaging for a customer to take home a tall baby cake from the bakery, then you should stop making them or order some appropriate packaging. By the time I got home from my five minute drive my cake was completely destroyed, sliding around in the stupid box that the lid won’t even close on top of it. How ridiculous. What a waste of my time and money.; A well cared for store. Good selection. Decent savings if you have a member card. Today was odd though. The smell of Starbucks coffee and fresh hot wings attacked my nose at the same time. My brain stopped braining for a second. Warn a guy first, dude.; Good store but removed couple stars because of wings from deli. Extremely dry and tasted weird, more like paper than wings (maybe frozen for long time before fried and dried?). Not worth any money."

I can't believe all the money we save using the app. And Starbucks is nothing but a trap from the first moment you walk through the doors the aroma from the coffee just pulls you right over to get a cup of coffee while you're shopping.  😁😁😁; Would be five but security isn’t tight and all the carts are far from the handicap spots on the west side of the store so the elderly that use them to walk and or lean on have to make it pretty far till they can get a kart. Yes my mother needed to report this because she is part of the elderly. But the store is nice inside and clean so 3 stars only to the handicap and cart situation.

After 3 weeks of waiting I’m now being told the person I was replacing didn’t quit and they don’t have hours due to it being summer.

Thank you Safeway keeping your store so clean lit  up with  bright lights  in your store. .; The staff is very helpful and kind.

Despite the fact that I have always had positive experiences at your market and have praised the friendly there, this particular incident left much to be desired.; Great service. Good prices.

Under construction for 2 years will likely finish in 6 more with that pace 😭; I've been shopping here for few years now for their fresh produce. Staff are very friendly. Produce are super fresh. Although, avoid shopping late in the afternoon or most of the good ones are gone by then. Most of the veggies, Im not familiar with, but having fun trying some of them. Still hoping they'll have fresh jicama again (smaller, juicier, and crunchier).  Some of their veggies and hebs come with roots intact so I cut the basil about 6 to 8 inches from the roots and replanted the bottom half. See photo of replanted basil, 2 big pots in the back. I think they are looking good after few months of replanting. Hopefully, they survive the winter and rainy season in Sac. Can't find the other photos taken from the store but will try to add next time I visit the market."

Also this place is overpriced for no reason; Only rating food from food court. Pizzas are pretty good. Tried the Pico de Gallo pizza and Rustica pizza. Rustica was well seasoned and my favorite. Pico pizza had a strong cumin flavor, something I don’t expect from a pizza. My wife had the chicken with yuca and salad. The rotisserie chicken was dry and yuca a bit bland.

Very convenient drive thru!; Tons of gluten free options! From bread all the way to noodles, dates and snacks.; I come weekly to this Freshmart. Every once in awhile I’ve opened a package and either found mold or bugs.  It’s happened a few times (mold in the oatmeal, a bug in the salad, mold on the gluten free bread) but I’ve always let it slide and didn’t take the time to return the item and continued to go. Today I bought a few yogurts, as soon as I got home I opened one. it tasted  sour and it was hard, not like yogurt  (the expiration date was in a week)  it was obviously bad so I opened a new one.  The second one had green mold layered over the top. Then I opened the third and noticed it wasn’t completely sealed. The 4th was sour and hard as well. Finally the 5th one was good so I ate that one and kept the 6th as well.  I drove back to Freshmart and tried to return the yogurts. They gave me money back for two but not for the other two because I tasted them.
It is not really about the money, I’m a continued costumer and spend a lot of money at this place. The cashier (could’ve been the manager)  was very condescending.  I have her name but won’t post it because maybe she was just having a bad day or maybe that is just her demeanor. But the customer service was definitely not there on her part. I’ll continue to go but only for certain items that I can’t find anywhere else. Will never do a full grocery shopping at this location again."

They have great employees and a much better meat department.; I came by here over the weekend in hopes to talk to my aunt that I haven't seen in years. I told a cashier who I was looking for. She was very nice. She knew who I was talking about. She proceeded to ask what looked like a manager if she (my aunt) was working today. She gave me an extremely dirty look and snapped back by saying she didn't know who that was or anybody by that name. And if I wanted to go see if she was working in the back, I could go look for her my own self. I was honestly taken aback by how rude this lady was. It was a white lady with long dark hair. I honestly am shocked how she got in a management position. I would hate to work under her because I have a feeling she talks to everyone that way. She stood in the same exact spot the whole time I was there doing nothing, but she didn't have time to help me. Also, I know for a fact my aunt has been working there for at least seven years. She's been working there since before it was Super One. So, this manager doesn't even know her own employees? Or maybe she doesn't care to know them. I was going to get a few things while there, but this lady was absolutely repulsive I left. I hope Super One addresses this issue and this lady has an attitude adjustment.; Friendly & helpful staff.

But if you are VEGETARIAN, VEGAN, or PESCATARIAN and on a tight budget, SHOP HERE FIRST!!!

Seniors get a $1 discount on every $10 spent (the maximum is $5 per total purchase) every Tuesday.

The store is always neat and clean but the organization of the items is somewhat baffling. For example, typically in stores ""like items"" are grouped on one aisle (not counting special displays and end caps). But if you stroll the aisles of the Grocery Clearance Center you will see groups of items repeated somewhat randomly throughout the store.

That said the pricing is variable in comparison to most stores. Some items are deeply discounted, some are slightly discounted, some show no discount, and some are priced to sell at a higher price than other stores. However, all the items I examined were in good shape and could be placed in your pantry for a long-term storage (unlike many you find at Walmart and pay full price for).

I was able to purchase large bags of fresh Mustard greens (pre-washed and sliced)for $1 each; Annie's vegetarian pizzas for $3.99; and a large variety of Manuka honey and spices. There were lots of fresh veggies in the cooler at an excellent price! And there is always a wide variety of cheese.

But I would be remiss if I didn't bring up ""use  and ""best by"" dates. You have to be mindful to check them before you put the items in your basket. The worst date I found was an item in the freezer section dated June 2022. That date was just a little bit too long ago for me to consider purchasing.

Finally, be very careful on the parking lot because it's full of moon craters. It needs resurfacing in a very bad way. This limits not only where and how you drive but also poses limits on where you park.; I'm hesitant to write a review because I don't want this awesome secret to get out! I love this place, you can always find something that suits you here. They almost always have some kind or cheese, yogurt or other fancy dairy that is a steal of a deal! Sometimes it's a flat of raspberries that I buy and freeze other times it's chips 12/$1. They have lots of stuff that's healthy as well. The staff is always nice and helpful. If you come bring a cooler, and make sure you have plenty of time for the treasure hunt!; Grocery Clearance Center on on 01/02/2023

I’m over it..; Beautiful Father's day cake. I had it costum made. I made sure to ask for something simple and easy I knew they could do. Nothing over the top. They did it so beautifully. Exactly what I wanted. Thank you.; Do not make the mistake of ordering home delivery from this store. An order a week ago was missing half the items that were paid for. I did get a few items that were for someone else's order so they were shorted as well. A call to the store's phone number somehow directed me to the wrong store in Duncanville. Once we figured that out, which took about 45 minutes I was transferred to the correct store where the phone went unanswered for a long period of time. I had to call the meat department who paged the manager, ""Austin."" Austin was very apologetic and the missing items were promptly delivered. Austin gave me a credit for the missing items as a gesture of good will. That whole episode took an hour and a half from time of delivery until re-delivery was agreed to. Today, a week later, I decided to give them another try and this time only one item was missing. Once again the store phone went unanswered for a long period so I called Customer Support at 877-505-4040 where I was told that re-delivery, due to it being a single item, was unavailable and that a refund would be offered. That was unacceptable so I asked to have the matter escalated and was told that it wouldn't make any difference. I demanded to speak with a manager and the call center agent agreed to transfer me. The phone again went unanswered so the agent contacted the home delivery department where they agreed to bring out the one item. This took about 40 minutes to resolve. This is a recurring problem and not the only issue. (1) ""Do not substitute"" items get substituted for product I won't eat because its GMO and soy or just not what I ordered. (2) Virtually all of the produce from this store I've had to throw away. Broccoli was rotten and smelled bad out of the bag  as it was delivered. Mushrooms were bad. It's like the shoppers have never cooked a meal or learned how to pick produce. The bananas are tasteless. I don't have this problem with Whole Foods. If you want to be shortchanged, receive bad produce and have,  in the last week, over two hours to waste on the phone trying to resolve their problems this is the store for you. If I could give 0 stars I would.

Update 10/1/24: Received the patronizing AI-generated reply below which shows total insincerity, and based on similar replies going back months, and my previous heart-to-heart with the management demonstrates they have no intention of correcting this dismal store's problems. Went to the Desoto Texas store today and it was like being in a different grocery chain. Desoto store was well-stocked, clean, employees were friendly and the produce was fresh. Will be pursuing getting deliveries from this store as they seem to actually care about their customers.; Tom Thumb on Hampton Avenue on Friday 13, 2023 at 7:26pm

First giving respect to the person in the Delhi area. Who originally helped me with the Tom Thumb app, trying to get the deal on the chicken.

I am mostly impressed with the person who was at the front self checkout area going back and forth between multiple areas. ""Ms. Kayla"" 🙏😇🇺🇸 kudos to this individual. They went far beyond customer service and making sure the fairness of the deal was there. This person help me navigate the app and made sure what I entered was correct. These things can be tricky for older customers and it's good to have competent individuals there to help navigate us through these trying times. Please Tom Thumb corporate office this should be a future manager 👍👍🇺🇸

Thank You for your service 🇺🇸😁; The Starbucks staff plays and horses around behind the register.  It should never take 25 minutes for one coffee. I'm extremely put off that management is allowing this kind of behavior. Not including I asked for matcha espresso. I was told no they didn't have it.

Might take the uninitiated a little bit of openmindedness--you may not find everything on your list or the exact brands to which you are accustomed--but I've been going for 12 years & have discovered numerous brands I now love & have saved much $$$ thanks to shopping there.; Editing my review. I was just told that I have to snake through a line that runs the length of half the store to get in line to checkout on Saturdays, the only day I shop. They even have a security guard to police the process. I waited for about 15 minutes thinking the line was only for the other aisles so I got out to check out and was talked to. I estimated a 45+ minute wait. By the time I got to the register, I would have made up the money I was saving with my time. Let me know when this process changes and I will consider being your customer again. For now, I won't be back. Think of a better system. I will begin discouraging friends and family from visiting town talk.; I no longer live in Texas, but they've always had the bargains if you have a catering business or restaurant can definitely get some good deals there if you have a deep freezer that's even better because you can buy practically the whole animal there I've shot there for the last 20 years they have three stores Weatherford Texas Arlington Texas and North Beach in fort Worth I miss shopping there on a regular basis and I love this store; I like strolling through there every once in a while sometimes I get in there they just had a fresh truck

This place does seem to attract the more unique people in society.

Parking is horrendous and the people are not very friendly when trying to find a spot or leave.  Strange because they all seem very polite inside the store.; Carson, was extremely helpful, I drove all the way from S. Arlington for one main item and he got me the item from the back storage. He really saved the day for me.
This store has some genuinely good people working here. The lady at the checkout was also very pleasant. The excellent customer service is one of the reasons I like to shop at this store.; Always enjoy shopping at this store. The parking is not ideal but the helpful staff and store cleanliness make up for it. They sell out of viral items fairly quickly, but most places do. The staff is always willing to help locate items and try to see when more are arriving if able. Good variety and quality items.; I was looking for truly healthy protein bars with no added sugar. Trader Joe's carried a couple I could choose from. One of the clerks was very kind and helpful in guiding me to just what I needed. This store is a little smaller than most I have been in but neatly maintained. The parking is very difficult as there is not an abundance of parking and there is a great deal of traffic.; My first visit!  What an interesting place!

When I found Hyaluronic acid that cost $40 instead of the $300 that I had been purchasing, I was blown away. Every individual they hire is amazing.

I left Dallas a little over an hour ago and decided to drive as far north as possible before stopping for gas.
I ended up stopping in Marrietta. The first gas station right off the highway was out of gas. I looked up the next available station and went down the road a little and made a right.
Pulling up I was thinking ""Wow, what a hell hole!"" I saw 2 double sided pumps. No covering. One pump was for diesel and the other for regular unleaded. The pumps didn't even have card readers!!!
I needed a red bull anyway so going inside wasn't a huge inconvenience. As I walked in the man greeted me cheerfully and asked how I was doing. I responded as I grabbed my red bull and went to the counter to pay.
He made such nice easy going conversation, it was relieving and a definite change of pace. Then as I walked back to the pump I thought to myself...Wow. If I didn't need a red bull from anywhere I was getting gas I wouldn't go in. I wouldn't come in contact with a single person, especially such a delightful person.
You really do need to stop and smell the roses sometimes. Technology rules our lives, especially mine. But setting all of the technology aside there are really amazing people left in the world. They just tend to be overlooked for our convenience.; The store in Marietta Oklahoma has the poorest customer service. I have been shopping in that store for over 10 years. The manager now and the clerks are not only keeping the store nasty and not cleaning it their faces when you walk in, looks like they can't stand customers, there is never even a hi any more or welcome, you just get this sour look like why are you in here. I have spent a lot of money in this store over the years, but not anymore not as long as these people are running it, it is aweful.; LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE...Awesome Sweet Tea always ready....EZ Mart girls are out of this world as far as customer service is concerned...always smiling and talking to every customer...Tiffany is the best tho...NEVER know what she might say or do...LOVE HER!!

Tell em I sent ya lol; It's been going downhill for a long time and yesterday my card was charged over 200 in fraudulent charges just to find out they had a scammer at the register. So everyone who has used them needs to cancel their card if you used it at THE REGISTER. Inside job or not you guys need real help all around. How does that even happen"

Neighborhood grocery store that can totally cater to the neighborhood that I live in. Interesting this morning my coworker comes in with some chicken wings that look fabulous. Their hot bar is basically a restaurant you have a seating area inside. Plenty of produce 🥒🥑🌶️🫚, their meat 🥩🍗🍖 section is humongous. They have alcohol and beer on the far side and you could even buy shoes inside this place. It is definitely set up for the community to achieve more at this grocery store than most others. One of my favorite things to get out of here is the fresh cut fruit 🍉🍍🥭 up front. They also have fresh bakery 🥐🥖🫓 breads and treats 😋 Always seems to have hot tamales.; OMG! The sign clearly says express 15 items or less and this lady continues to ring this lady’s groceries up like she can’t tell she has well over 200 items!!! 🙄🙄🙄; Do you like waiting an hour to check out with a gallon of milk? Then this is the place for you!  On God, they'll have lines to the back of the store and like 3 cashiers.

Prices? Just bad. The cheapest thing there are vegetables and meat. But $5 for a dozen maximum cruelty eggs? $2.50 for a pound of off brand spaghetti? So on and so on.

At least they have stock and mostly keep the drug addicts out; Pupusas on the weekend were a great addition, giving it 3 starts there should be a limit on how many pupusas you can order, instead of waiting on large order of 20 and 30, some just want 2 or 3 but end up leaving because of large orders; The lady frontend manager was very rude. I'm disabled and was having trouble starting the handicap cart they have for customer in-store use so I had to find someone for assistance and the cashier's would not even help but just point fingers in directions like wow great help. Finally I found I'm assuming the manager lady and she rudely said ""Well it's not gonna work without key""
How was I supposed to know
Then I asked for a key and her reply was ""Do you have Id"".

This is something everyone must witness to believe. If this is your local grocery store you don’t know how fortunate you are. Been, and lived, in many locals now and nothing comes close to this experience. Clearly the best grocery store bar none. Brain and belly overload, clean throughout even while busy, friendly and knowledgeable staff in every department, and leaves you in a sort of euphoria rarely achieved. Central Market definitely set the proverbial bar extremely high. Keep up the great work!; I came here for lunch at the Cafe and made my own salad. The salad ingredients were so fresh and there were so many options to choose from. There's also a sandwich line and tons of ready-to-eat choices for pastas, meats, salads, BBQ, rice, and more. There's a nice sushi section and different types of coffee. It was actually a bit overwhelming for my first visit to see how much food there was. Plenty of seating inside, outside, and upstairs by their cooking school.; Central Market is just the best supermarket, this location in the heart of Texas! Is a foodie paradise that never disappoints. With its vast selection of fresh produce, artisanal products, and gourmet treats, Central Market elevates grocery shopping to a whole new level. Whether you're searching for exotic ingredients for a culinary adventure or simply stocking up on everyday essentials, this supermarket has you covered. The vibrant atmosphere and knowledgeable staff add to the shopping experience, making each visit a pleasure. From the bustling bakery to the expansive cheese section, Central Market is a must-visit destination for anyone passionate about food.; We went to this market first thing in the morning and bought every piece of king crab legs for my daughters birthday. Two days later we cooked the crab legs and they were completely bad. Very strong ammonia smell. The cost was $288. I called the seafood department and because I tossed the receipt (yes... very bad mistake on my part) they would not refund my money which is totally understandable. I did speak with Mark on the seafood dept and appreciated that he would give me crab to replace, but living an hour away this was not feasible.
I drove to this store for a premium product. I received great service, but a terrible product. Beware when buying seafood from this store.; I love the incredible selection and variety provided by Central Market.  You can't find a  fresher selection of meat and seafood. I really enjoy visiting this location."

Fast service, booming drive through. Great bacon & egg tacos (smoked bacon😋).; Usually a great place but today in the morning I went by and bought breakfast tacos potatoe and egg with beans and cheese and in one of my tacos there was something black it was big not sure what it was I almost choked! I was so disappointed ☹️; Awesome breakfast tacos. The staff is on the ball here! Lunch is well served! Highly recommend to anyone passing through here. Tables to sit and eat.; I had been told about Rios meat market.
Finally decided to stop.
Now I wish I had stopped here sooner.
Their food is awesome.
The food is old school home cooking.
It really has mom's cooking; Update: they no longer sell meat. The tacos are ok but the overall prices are expensive. The large bag of Takis are 3.99+tax! Insane, when I can get it at Fast Track for less and at Walmart for 2.33. They recently increased the price of flour tortillas so they're now $0.50 each. Really. I love Mexican sodas but they lean towards the $4 mark, with Joya being the most expensive. Rios is successful manily due to lack of competition. If Stripes were closer, they would stand no chance. They have a lot of clientele especially in the mornings because who wants to drive to the La Villa Stripes? Even though Rios is literally like 30 seconds from my house I'd rather drive all the way to HEB or Walmart to buy chips, sodas or tortillas for a lot cheaper. I only come here when I'm desperate lol"

I do not lie the whole range of snacks is always my weakness. Checkout and service has always been great. Not to mention having your own customer park lot in the city always makes going a breeze.; Well let’s not judging the cleanness or the attitudes of the cashiers. It’s Chinese market, we came here for the groceries that we don’t get from Whole Foods or Costco. They carry enough options for seafood, which is a huge plus. Vegetables are fresh. Meats are ok. Need more Asian snacks though.; This place was busy when I went there (on a Saturday). It was relatively less expensive than its neighboring store (New York Marts). I recommend going to this shop first before the other one nearby. You'll get a wider variety of vegetables at a fraction of the cost. Will be coming here more often."

I was so impressed in front of my guests. I called the store to let them know. Her response (OH I WILL TALK TO HIM AND SEE. Didn’t even apologize or tried to make it up to me.
Note: I ordered the tray on Sunday to be ready Monday at 3:00 pm therefore I want to change one of the items so I called around 10:00 am Monday asking them if I can cancel one item on the tray and add another one. She said I can’t do that because they already started it so I was like WHAT my order not until 3:00 pm why would they start now she was like oh no just the round koba must be boiled now. So I was like yeah please don’t let start my order now that’s way too early and won’t even look fresh. Therefore now I believe that the whole tray was made earlier that’s why the koba halab smelled and tasted sour . Other items were okay but at this point I don’t trust it at all. I just don’t understand why people treat others just like the way they want to be treated be honest and work extra harder to make your customers happy. Don’t start customers order 6 hours before promising time just because you want to save money making your employees work part time only. Anyway never ever again that place is no no to me .; Staff and owner are very friendly and helpful. They don't act pretentious or have their noses in the air. This is the only place I purchase my homemade yogurt (liban) from. The thick layer of cream skin is so delicious and such a treat. But the best part about the yogurt here is that when they make it they slightly burn the pot of milk so it adds this incredible smokey flavor that just makes it absolutely perfect. You can't find this anywhere else. If you've never tried Iraqi yogurt before get it from here, you won't be disappointed.; Thank you, Babylon Markets. The bread in Babylon Markets is very excellent and I give it 100%
SAM from Alliston Ontario; The staff here is great.  Big helpful smiles.  The breads, fresh and amazing.  Sometimes the fruit has fruit flies, so ALWAYS wash your fruit no matter where you get it from.  Watch an episode of ‘MONSTERS INSIDE ME’.  You’ll be washing your store bought fruit every time.

But the customers in here leave a lot to be desired.  Some are just pigs.  I’ve had men take cuts in front of me. It’s like you’re not even there.  The meat counter; well for one thing the butcher can’t speak English.  The second thing, everything there is covered with blood.  The handles on the freezer doors, smeared with blood.  The butchers apron loaded with blood.   I just wonder if the health inspector has been by recently?

Lastly, never, NEVER buy the mixed olives, pickles, beets, baby corn etc., from the open salad bar thing in front of where the Iraqi bread is baked.  On more then one occasion I have witnessed bare hands & fingers help themselves to the pickles, olives, and beets.  I saw a man with a cigar in one hand (between fingers) shift the cigar over to the other hand and then his smoking bare hand goes in for a beet which he immediately gulps down (I saw him help himself over & over again while waiting to fill his bread bag)!  Just yesterday I witnessed an older lady go in the olives for her free sample.  I said rather loudly”that’s gross!”  Then I asked her “Would you buy those olives if my bare hand took those olives?” She then waves her hand at me and says “I no speak English.”   Well she understood something cause.she
then put a few olives into a plastic container and walked around the ,store munching away.

So here’s my review in a nutshell:  their baked bread is excellent,  Their employees are always smiling and seem happy, they’re AWESOME!  Their produce is win some, lose some with the freshness and fruit flies,  Their relish/salad bar, STAY AWAY!  Their butcher counter STAY AWAY.  And their customers/clients, well you can’t make a silk purse with a sows hide.

Have a good day!; Just be careful they will try to steal from you or giving you a bad product or expired. The staff is not professional at all and the way they dealing with customer is very bad they lied to me and the manager and the owner do not want to admit it. End of the day just do not deal with them and keep your business with somewhere else that appreciate and respect you as a customer. They are the worst ever."

I visited the pink house nutricentre by mistake, thinking that I would find food like in other nutricentres on the island, Mr. asks me what I'm looking for, I answer food and he tells me that there is no food there, and I continue to tell him to go into the center of nutrition thinking that there was, He tells me that this is not a nutrition center and that it is WIC (until that moment not knowing what WIC is) he tells me that he has been working there for more than 20 years and that it is only for children but no for adults, but then he also tells me that it is for pregnant women (are pregnant women adults or not?) The gentleman got upset, I proceed to give him information about what a nutricenter would be and he tells me no and that I disrespected him because he has been there for years. there... here I wonder, the WIC is supposed to offer nutritional education to ADULTS, breastfeeding support that is for ADULTS, NUTRITIOUS FOODS for ADULTS... is it fair that this gentleman is so uninformed and that a government institution is not suitable for future mothers on the island? Annoyed he kicked me out of his premises, but it makes me think of other people who come in to ask for information and this man does not know, it is urgent that he be given adequate training or that he be changed areas, it is not possible for him to receive funds from the government federal and that store has nothing!

Big parking lot. Easy to find parking usually.

If you’re cooking Asian dishes. This place will probably have it. Chinese, Vietnamese, Indian, Korean, Japanese food.

There were only two check out lanes open. You might have to wait depending on their staffing.

Compared to hmart this place has more variety options. But surprisingly the pots and butane were cheaper at hmart.

I like to get sauces condiments, dry goods here but vegetables and meats from hmart or other stores.

Nice Asian grocery store near  Malden; Uhmmm, I go there for certain ingredients you just can't find at your local stores. They have a good variety of unique greens and food. Fair warning the store requires you to pinch your nose a bit. It just has its own aroma in there. But if you're on a mission to get your ingredients, you will do what you gotta do and not notice it too much. I'm convinced the odor is either from the meat dept or the fish dept. Anyways, a nice selection of foods, decent prices, not bad, the seafood is a hit or miss. But overall, it's an OK place; Check out closely your receipts when shopping here. They might charge you the full original price for those items on which they put discount tags! I purchased sachima showing “2 for $6.99” and they charged me undiscounted price, $9.98. And their excuse went just “someone forgot to take down the discount tag”.; Great supermarket, but the quality of produce is not always immaculate. You'll get a rotted onion every now and then.

A most delicious chilli crisp selection.; Friggin adore this store. Just a vast selection to get lost in. The Candy aisle didn't disappoint either. Nor the drink aisle ❤️. Can't wait to go back. Takes Cash/Card/EBT. Definitely worth exploring and trying new things. Spoiler the winter melon tastes like a water filled cucumber :p"

they do have a large variety of Chinese groceries, some of their groceries, such as vegetables, gingers, fish, etc. are not fresh. The workers there are not friendly, either."

Everytime we try to go in its always pack and we end up leaving. Today we finally got to try this restaurant and the food was amazing. The food was so flavorful every dish had it's own unique taste. So glad we stopped by today and had the chance to try it out. My favorite was the butter chicken. They are super friendly here. We will be back to try something new.; I being a pure vegetarian and was tempted to eat paneer biryani. So, I ordered Paneer biryani today from this place. When I opened the box it was topped with very good looking paneer. Then I took one spoon from the box what I saw was traumatizing. It had big chunks of chicken peices inside. I was in a shock for few minutes and then I had to trash the entire thing. This is the last thing being an India you expect from an Indian restaurant. Highly disappointed and never going to order anything from this place. Stay away from this restaurant guys!!!!; Let’s start with, I love Indian food. I spend many parts of summers in the UK, and I’m always looking for a good curry over there. So when I heard of this place, that is more authentic and smaller, I rushed over. I ordered the chicken korma before my recent visit to the UK (June 2024) and tho I liked it, I wasn’t excited about how sweet it was (almost like extra sugar was added). But I had it again after my trip, just now, and it was perfect. So whatever you’re doing now (July 2024) unless if it’s just happenstance one or both times, keep doing it. I’ve also had their $10 fill your plate deal, and it does not disappoint, actually the opposite! The food is flavorful, and delicious. I was raised eating various southeast Asian foods with friends and neighbors. This tastes like home to me. Thank you!  Also get yourself a PAPAD or naan from the freezer section to have some for later too with any leftovers…. They also have some class UK snacks, so that’s a plus. I love that it’s grocery and a cafe!; Great little find. This cafeteria style eatery serves a chefs special combo meal for $13. It comprises of a variety of small dishes presented on a tray with dividers. The person helping us was awesome explaining and showing us the different dishes.  The spice level was about 6 out of 10. They also have an A La Carte menu if you are not in a rush.
Today I didn't have time to check out the attached grocery store, next time!; The food is absolutely fantastic.  Very delicious! Love that  Fuquay is growing and it’s great to get a larger variety of food types.  I love spicy food. This food definitely has a little kick for those who enjoy that. If you don’t they have options for you as well.  Also the grocery has a great variety of hard to find vegetables and spices.  They carry Halal Butchered meat as well.  The owners are wonderful and kind people.  Meeting them would also be a lovely part of your experience as well."

I purchased a $53 rounded-bottom wok on 03/03/2024. On 03/17/2024 after a 45 minute drive, I came to the store for grocery shopping and to exchange for a flatted-bottom wok.
I was taken by surprise when the customer service person refused to do an exchange. She circled to the 7-day return/ exchange policy at the bottom of the receipt. She also called a “manager”.

However, a few minutes later, a lady showed up, grabbed the receipt and pointed to the print of the 7-day return/ exchange policy on the receipt and said, “see here, and I can’t do anything”, and left.

Attached are the photos of the wok and the original receipt.

1) Inattentiveness can result in overcharges for a few items.

2) Instances of items being double-charged have also been noted.

3) Customers using EBT cards should be particularly vigilant, as they may be charged for more than their actual purchase.

I strongly advise anyone considering shopping here to remain vigilant during checkout, meticulously review their receipts before leaving, as the market tends to exploit inattentiveness, leading to additional charges. This predicament has affected almost all of our acquaintances, neighbors, and even ourselves.; Cashier name Thuy is rude , she didn't even say hello or thank you to customers .

The tiny Japanese grocery store near where we lived in Greenwich CT was one fourth the size and had much better selections. This store was also pricy and while it seemed they have authentic Japanese goods, they're missing key staples like shoku pan milk bread.; Great local Japanese market with a good selection of fresh produce, frozen items and prepared foods as well as random stationary and utensils.

I stopped by for the 'summer festival' event on 8/13/23 and picked up the freshly made okonomiyaki and takoyaki ($6 each) - tastes just like what you'd get at a stall in Osaka, though I did have to spend 40 minutes in line for that.; Lovely store that me and my husband will be frequenting!

We both had a wonderful time and learned a great deal from our instructor, Chef Tucker. We felt the class was a great value and a fantastic way to spend and evening. I appreciated the small size (limited to 5 participants) and thoughtful instruction. Everything we made was absolutely delicious, but we particularly liked the torched salmon belly. We hope Ebisuya will continue to offer classes in the future (hopefully at different skill levels). Many thanks to Chef Tucker and the entire Ebisuya staff.; I have been literally looking everywhere for a legit Japanese market like the ones I used to frequent to for years in Japan as a little one. I'm not talking H Mart or other Asian grocers with ""all-things Asian"". Not that I have anything against them, and I definitely frequent them for most of my Asian needs! But I was looking for a place with anything and all Japanese, and I happened to find it right next to our hotel in Medford of all places. They have full stock on just about anything you would find in a supermarket in Japan, from frozen goods and fresh seafoods to kitchenwares and school supplies. They even have a small restaurant with freshly made bento and made-to-order sushi, AND a fully functioning automatic Toto toilet/bidet in their restroom!

For a while now I've been craving arabiki (Japanese sausage) and ever since I left Japan I've only had it once more at Japadog in NYC before they closed. I was nearly brought to tears of joy when I saw that they carried the sausages here, and instantly bought several packs to take home. Among other unique offerings they also had soy sauce dispensers with all different kinds of soy sauce to self service from, and entire sections of Japanese pastries and snacks.

We also ordered some fresh made bento and sushi, and were extremely pleased. The oyakodon was to die for, and it was made with haenuki rice, which brought back some fond memories as a child. The tamago nigiri was amazing as well, not to mention the hamachi, tuna, and octopus nigiri we ordered. The only downside, if being picky, is that they don't have any alcoholic beverages. They do have non-alcoholic beer, but nothing that would make you tipsy. No worries there for us, however. We can find them widely available elsewhere.

Parking is on the street, so don't forget to pay the meter, it's only 25 cents for 15mins, or if you're like us, walk from the hotel.

We could easy spend a whole day here if we wanted to! I know for a fact that we will be making routine stops here if we are in the Boston area again, it's definitely worth the trip!"

Ughhhhh I wish this place opened earlier before I left the city 2 years ago😭😭😭😭😭; We visited this place to get kakigori for dessert. We got the yuzu and the strawberry kakigori. Both were way too sweet for me. I was looking for parts of ice that didn't have any syrup/topping for respite from the syrupy sweetness.

I wouldn't get the kakigori again. When Tsurumen in Davis has kakigori, they make it with a much better balance of flavors. And Oasit's Sweet in Brookline also has great shaved ice. It looks like they have a lot of other good food though, so I'd be down to try that in the future!; Wow! A MUST SEE place! Experience for yourself. What a nice place to have great Japanese food and drinks. Can get busy at certain times of the day, but the vibe is a good mix of lounge and restaurant. Definitely a win."

This is the best place in North Fulton if you need authentic Mexican ingredients.

I went to this one and man was I so pleased inside!  Not only did I find my Mojo sauce but great fresh vegetables, assorted spices, hot sauces and fruits, it was just like being in Mexico.

I find their produce particularly appealing; however, after a very unpleasant exchange with a downright rude, unprofessional, and outright hostile employee at the Service Desk this past Monday, September 30, 2024 at 7:56 am, I will never shop at the Somerville location off McGrath Highway again.

I had used a self-service machine to ring up exactly three items: a bag of grapes, a pork loin, and a package of ground turkey. According to the Star Market app, the turkey was supposed to be $3.97, but it rang up as $6.99. I then went to the Service Desk to rectify the matter, and that’s when my “buying experience” went awry.

There was a person at the counter, who presented as a female of color with a ring through her nose, to whom I said, “Hi, this turkey didn’t ring up at the right price;” she looked at me and said, “We don’t open until 8:00.” I then looked at my phone, which read  7:56, and holding up the package of turkey replied, “So, how do I get this addressed?” Her retort was, “You have to wait four minutes.” I was incredulous, but okay.

I stood at the counter and waited the four minutes, while she repeatedly shuffled papers located on a desk behind her. At 8:00, she looked up at me and said, “How can I help you?” I explained about the turkey, and as it turned out, and as she very nastily pointed out, in her tone of voice, the package I picked up wasn’t “the one on sale; that’s the 99% fat free one, and the app says we’re out of it.” I was stunned at this exchange. Shocked at the unnecessary vehemence she displayed, I told her I wanted to return it and did so. That encounter has bothered me for a few days now.

The purpose of this review is to inform Star Market management that this particular employee, on that morning, was an extremely poor representation of its company.

I believe in following “rules.” If the company policy is that a matter such as mine can’t be remedied until the cash machine turns on at 8:00 at the Service Desk, then that employee could have and should have communicated such clearly and without contempt. That was not the case. There was absolutely no need for the manner in which she addressed me and my concern.

I realize that some do not understand that there’s an art to customer service, and that employee was a perfect example of untrained and uncaring. We all should take pride in whatever work we do, and that woman lacked it that morning. That’s unfortunate for her, but she cannot and will not take it out on me. I will never shop at this location again.; Just bought two of these home and noticed both are opened and one was half the volume of the other. Obviously someone opened and drank and put them back. That’s so gross!
The store is big but seriously understaffed. I will never buy any food from this store again.; Molded veggie Bubba burgers on sale at this Star market.

Recently they only keep the self check out open. Very un helpful and understaffed.

This used to be one of the best grocery stores in the area, yet they have had high turn over,  obvious stocking and inventory control issues and very poor customer service, even phone calls to this store are greeted with un professional staff responses.

This location needs a visit from the Sommervile Health department.

Thier Dairy coolers also smell and need attention for sanitation the past few visits I have made.

I will no longer be a patron of this location.

Edit: I got the message from Star market Managment here on Google that the issues is being looked into internally, just to note, I have also contacted Bubba Burger about this issue and are in email contact with them also and will be contacting city officials to make a report to have the board of health also investigate this issue.

Edit- 5/9/24 The Sommerville Heath department responded to my email requesting investigation of the mold issue. The company for Bubba Burger also responded in kind.; The vibes are off here in inexplicable ways! The prepared foods case appears to have a chronic leak in the bottom so there are crumpled paper towels there to stanch the flow. The flooring itself is stained and cracked and needs to be replaced throughout the store, but those things don't account for the uncanny feeling throughout the store; Maybe you should hire employees for the cash register rather than expecting customers to do that. Prices aren’t very good, the service is not very good,, and the produce is often bad. I see the empty parking lot all the time when I drive past it to go to Market Basket, which is much further, but infinitely better. There’s a reason why the parking lot is empty."

But with that said, we still love to shop there and sometimes we even stock up on the product, knowing it may not be there on our next shopping trip.

It's important to look at your customer's face when you are taking to them so they feel recognized and appreciated,, not jumping on your cellphone  before you have give your customer the receipt.  That's is an experience  from real life on Saturday, August 31, 2024 with cashier Orysya.

Thanks.; No fresh produce, mostly looks old or gone bad. Cramped store but nice meat department just a little bit pricey for me. Some items in freezer have freezer burn and looks bad.

I'll be back, but I'll definitely be using self checkout!; Clean, nicely arranged. They had sparkling water, which was the only thing I came to pick up. Staff were friendly, and the parking lot had plenty of available parking spaces.

In a strip mall, so there were other shops and restaurants to check out.; Local products

I like the local theme, lots of Michigan brands. It is more of a specialty market with higher prices. It is not the type of market where you would do your every day type shopping but to stop in for one or two items is nice.
Very bright and friendly staff.; Very well maintained shop.  Vegetables are fresh, slightly expensive but good quality

Very friendly staff; I will never buy anything fresh from this store again. Went here on Monday 4/22. Bought a loaf of bread, the next morning the bread had mold.

We bought a chicken Parmesan sandwich and a roast beef reuben sandwich, very well made, the chicken and beef meat were extremely tender.

Definitely recommended!; Great sandwiches and service was very nice. Sandwiches were delicious and easily could be two meals for a reasonable price. They had a special deal for the holiday when I went and I was unaware. They realized they were about to overcharge me as I was checking out and gave me the reduced price which was kind and they could've easily let me miss it.; On our visit to Massachusetts, we visited this place and had the worst experience of our lives. We ordered two chicken wraps with black olives and vegetables, I don't remember what drink we ordered. The young man who served us was Latino like us, white skinned and short hair and some tattoos. He pretended to be nice to us very well. We placed the order and sat outside and waited for a few minutes.

They brought us the order and the wraps had been taken out of the fridge, they were almost frozen, they didn't even heat them up. When I told the young lady who brought us the wraps that they were cold from the fridge, she told us that they served them like that. Of course we didn't believe her, but we ate them anyway.

We felt ripped off and it was a complete mockery. No one should go through that. They treated us like idiots."

Staffs behind the counter are friendly and love to give suggestion how to prepare certain seafood when asked ! They took care of cutting the fish, clean and skin. Recommend this shop any chance I could to my friends 😁; I’ve been going to New Deal for years to get the best fish and seafood in the Boston metro area. I live in Roslindale but make the roughly hour round trip to Cambridge as often as I can. The variety and quality of different fish plus a consistent supply of whole fish is unmatched. Staff is helpful, knowledgeable and good people. Love these guys!; Absolutely stellar quality fish - I've shopped often on my way from work and only wish we lived closer to New Deal Fish Market!

New Deal is near a bus stop that runs through Harvard, and a short walk from Kendall. There are a few spots to lock up bikes on the same block, but traffic and the condition of the road surface doesn't make it that pleasant of a ride!"

This place is adorable and all the staff have been outstandingly kind to me. They are very helpful in explaining their offerings and they also let me know they have different made to order foods (like this burger) for different days of the week. In addition to things you'd expect at a butcher's, they also carry ice cream, other snacks, and even mini laundry detergent. Would absolutely recommend, anything I've had from here has been delicious.; I was recommended by a neighbor to come here for raw marrow bones for my dog, and was blown away the first time I went in. Beautiful grocery items as well as knowledgeable and super friendly staff. They even asked my dog’s size to make sure the bones were cut to a safe size.

Excellent customer service!

The store itself is bigger than the other Super G and had a great selection of not just Asian food, but other international food and non-consummable items as well. They had aisles for African, European, Indian and other miscellaneous categories. It was fun to just walk around and explore.

The attached food court, Alley 51, had great food hubs. Manila Grill had great Filipino food at reasonable prices, but there were also Thai, Japanese Ramen, Vietnamese, Chinese Pancake and other types of cuisine.; This Super G is way bigger than the independence road location in Charlotte. Has every ethicnic food that you can think of that shows you they are very inclusive. Multiple employees working at every department. There's even a French Bakery that's serves cakes and coffee. Even though the store was packed self check out was a breeze.; If you're seeking an international grocery experience in Pineville, NC, Super G Mart is a must-visit! This immense store boasts a spectacular array of fresh seafood that is simply unrivaled. The highlight for me is the live crab table—a unique feature where you can choose your own live crabs, ensuring the freshest seafood meal possible. Alongside this, the vegetable selection is tremendous, offering diverse options that are perfect for pairing with any seafood dish. Whether you're a seafood aficionado or just exploring new culinary delights, Super G Mart will not disappoint with its fresh offerings and vibrant atmosphere!; This was my first time going to this place as we have a super G closer in Matthews. The supermarket actually was a bit smaller but the food court was very large. There were so many different things to try. Korean, Chinese ,Phillipino, Japanese, Vietnamese and also dessert places. Fully stocked bars too! The only thing I would advise is to get there early or go on an off time because it has long lines on the weekends. Prices were about the same as going to a restaurant. Pay in cash. They appreciate it. Don't look as you pass the first or second restaurant. There's some roasted ducks hanging there with their heads still on.; While I love having access to the range of ingredients Super G Mart offers, you have to be careful that you aren't getting taken advantage of.  For example, I purchased 1.66 lbs (26.6 oz) of squid.  Turns out that half of it's weight was ice, netting 14.0 oz of squid.  I'll be careful to avoid their in-store packaged frozen seafood in the future."

This store is very diversified and that is why you will see people from almost every culture and race shopping.  The biggest reason people shop there is that everything is reasonably priced and they have big verities of fresh produce, you will also find spices and ingredients from Central Asia, Africa, Korea, China, India, Pakistan, Caribbean countries and many other countries.
They have huge numbers of workers always working and stocking up the shelves and that’s why you won’t see an empty shelve there unlike other big stores.
If you’re looking for that missing ingredient that you can’t find anywhere, give them a try you won’t be disappointed.; **WARNING** Be mindful of pricing and employees who have no regard for honesty. I picked out two fish and realized that the person weighed them at the wrong price.  The  worker pointed to a  sign and refused to honor the $$ amount they listed the lower price.  I asked that they remove one of the fish.  I brought it to the attention of the store manager and he had them to honor it. I wanted to add the original amount of fish back and the department manager refused to honor the original amount. I just left it. This seems like a small issue until you think of the reason there are laws in place about this very issue. Principle is everything!!! He lost business over $1. I can recommend anyone to shop at a place I can’t trust to do the right thing. Shop at your own risk."

Only option was online refund request. Did that and it called the items ""missing"" no option for damaged. The impression Kroger leaves is they would like to solve all issues with refunds.

Note the soggy accumulation of wet crumbs in the corner of the box as it was positioned upside down in the water contaminated bag.; Used to love kroger when we first moved nearby a few years ago but in the last year something has changed.  Pick up orders are rarely ever ready on time, or they're missing items.  Prices seem to be much higher here compared to other retailers in the area. They have expanded self check out, my assumption is they can't keep help and this was the solution, and maybe explains the issues with pick up orders now? It's disappointing that the changes have been negative vs positive, hopefully whatever changes have happened have at least been positive for their employees.  🤷‍♀️; Good place to buy groceries even at 9:30 at night.; I'm disgusted that what was my favorite grocery store has changed. They now are more like an employer, since we now basically have to check ourselves out. Why, why, why?! It's not saving us any money! Why are they expecting their customers to do this, and why are we doing it?! It's frustrating, time consuming and we're not getting ANYTHING out of it, except higher prices and more work.; Line is 10 plus people long and only one section of the new self check outs is being used. 6 unused self check outs with the line being out of control. The new self check outs with conveyer belts appear to slow down the process, but the fact that this store has spent capital on additional self check outs only to neglect the needed self check outs when the lines are out of control speaks to some issues. Only one employee manning self check outs is not enough. Sorry to give a negative review, but it appears this store needs more dedicated workers manning the needed self checkouts. Please fix."

Here's a bad review for an Asian oriental market:

""Unfortunately, my experience at wausau oriented market was disappointing. The cleanliness of the store left much to be desired; there were several instances of expired products on the shelves. The staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful when approached for assistance. The selection of fresh produce was limited and not well-maintained. Overall, I left feeling unsatisfied and unlikely to return.; I love it! The prices are surprisingly cheap and everyone there is so nice. The only issue I have with it is some of the items don't have a price tag so you have to go to the front to ask the price and the store looks a little shady with crooked steps and peeling paint. Also the doors are hard to open. The fruits and vegetables are fresh and the general vibe is very nice; I can't even give 1 star horrible customer service , I was asking them for a  couple products if they sold at the I s business online said they did Balutis what I wanted...lady was rude rude rude ....; Normally I always post really positive reviews but I just want to make people aware.  When you buy rice there really look at the bags.  I bought a 10lb bag of rice for a craft. (Warm heating bags) About 1/10 that way through I found a dead flying bug.  Didn't think much of it.  As I got further and further down I found more and more and then they were alive.  Then I found larvea. That you may not notice and would then cook and eat.  The bag even has cobwebs in it.  I'm a little worried what I'll find further down.  I'm halfway down the bag now.  The tiny perfect circle holes in the bag are what indicate bugs but I wasn't looking for that when I bought it. I bought this bag yesterday. 10/3/2020.; Nice place. A lot more run down than most stores but it has a nice homely atmosphere. Got a decent selection, including catfish, which I find very hard to find. Reasonable prices aswell."

There definitely one of the better stores out there for selection of Asian foods as since they carry a variety if you're looking for something special they would be a great place to start at. I know I'll definitely hit them up again in the future!!; There are a lot of products from Asia.
I found fresh mangosteen, Bok coy, water spinach and some vegetables here.
There are a lot of Asian drinks, seasoning and snacks from different countries with cheaper price.; Great selection and very friendly staff!!! My go to Asian grocery store!!!; Very clean store, very organized, good selection of pantry items and produce items. Friendly staff. Would recommend.; We were really excited to discover this store, just off from south 17th Ave. They stock a lot of ingredients that cannot be easily found. The vegetables alone like their fresh lemon grass, was such a great find. The Pho restaurant next door is definitely worth the visit too."

Not soggy at all, but crispy and there’s a decent amount of seafood in it.
The kimchi stew is pretty sour, you can’t drink it alone, you need to pair it with rice. The tteokboki isn’t spicy at all, very mild.; Ordered Gul Rung Tang - flavorless
Dduk Bok Gi - good amount of spice
O Sam Bul Go Gi - yummy maybe you can share with two. Did not see any squid. But it comes with a very small portion of rice. They give you kimchi and 3 other sides. Small but they are fresh. Service is quick. Appetizer- 10 piece Yaki Mandoo - it was ok not much flavor maybe if i had some sauce.; This place has a vast variety of Asian food and snacks with a restaurant inside as well. If you are looking for an Asian snack odds are they have what you're looking for. Also the service is A1. I've been twice and each time I've been greated with a smile and checkout was always friendly. Check it out!; This was by far some of the best Korean food I have eaten in Charlotte. If you weren't looking for this place, it would be easy to miss! Additionally, you will want to enter from the side of the building where you park, not the front! As you walk in, there's a cute little seating area that is tucked into the grocery store. To kick the meal off, we ordered the steamed mandoo. It was super soft and pillowy while the filling inside was delicious. They are kind of big so make sure not to fill up on these at the start.

As for my main course, I ordered the Bibimbap. This bowl of food was made with love, and I enjoyed every bite. The base consisted of rice, and it was accompanied by a bunch of different veggies, meat, and a perfectly cooked egg! There is also a bibimbap sauce that came with the dish that added the right amount of spice and tang. The fish cakes were also our favorite side dish! Our waitress was great, and I would definitely make this place a priority on your list if you are on the search for Korean food in the area.; Best Korean food in Charlotte.

Kimchi pancake 10/10. Cold noodles I didn’t like but my friend did. Spicy squid over rice soooo good. But then short ribs omg 100000/10"

The bulk spices and teas are great quality and a huge variety. Gotta be strong when I pass up the cakes in the refrigerator section though!; Great place to find all sorts of bulk goods, rare organic items and foods and local foods, if you're in the area there definitely worth a stop as you would be surprised at some of the items they carry. There even a good place to check out for growing your own sprouts and they have cheese and yogurt making supplies.; I love this store. They have a ton of gluten free options and if you can't find what you need, they'll happily order it in for you. And the best coffee you'll find in the area (Ruby!).; Pretty clean.  Nice salad/soup bar.  Good coffee. Bakery items were rather bland.  Enjoyed the turkey goat cheese wrap and the broccoli salad.  A few tables on the main floor; more seating on the upper level.  The staff are knowledgeable and friendly.  The women at checkout were cold. I would definitely recommend for a healthy lunch and elite groceries.; One of my favorite spots to grab a quick bite in Wausau. It’s hip and cozy. The live acoustic music that often plays over lunch is soulful and just puts me in a good mood. One of the few places I don’t mind eating alone with my laptop. Besides that the food is fresh, healthy options and delicious!"

The quality of the steaks both pork and beef will not disappoint.; Fantastic quality meat at a great price. Very affordable for low-income people. Also fantastic service. I recommend Then to all my friends.
The best place to go for meat package or lunches.; Great little market. The meat is the attraction here. Good guys working here, nice lady at the checkout. Quality meat products.; Had reasonably priced chix salad sandwich on white untoasted bread. Big chunks of tender and juicy white meat in it. Very tasty and filling. Right on!; Meet in the deli is fantastic but the other parts of the store need restocking with fresh items I want to date items need to be removed from the shelves 😕."
