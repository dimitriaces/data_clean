Great service.; I had called about a week ago to inquire about a certain brand and flavors I always use. I was asked a few questions by the man that answered the phone and then he said he would order and have in a few days. He said that new customers get a discount that would make my selections $12 a bottle for 60ml. I went in today and they guy there said none of that was true. He was not rude he was very polite but at 17 a bottle I won’t be going there again since the man I had spoke to had clearly told me a certain price and no one seemed to know what I was talking about.; Amazing service very nice lady that I had spoke to 10/10; Short back story......... I have used e-cigs from 2007, I have always bought my supplies online.  The particular products I use are much harder to find online.

I went into this place to see the latest products in person, I was acknowledged Immediately by Dylan.  He was so patient with me, explaining all the latest products and taking the time to help me find the right es device for me.  I can’t say enough about Dylan and this shop.
I highly recommend this place if you are looking for your Vape needs.  They also have a huge array of Vape juice and CBD.
You will not be disappointed.  The products, knowledge and Great Customer Service are the reasons I will continue to shop here.; By far the worst customer service hands down.  Whomever “helped” me all he said was 1 to 2 word answers, and spoke so quietly I could barely understand his yes and no’s.  Was glad to find a shop closer to my address to save time.  Next time I need any vape juices I’ll definitely drive the extra mile west to another shop.  Bout the only good thing was the price, other than that it’s about it"

Not sure what’s going on now. Ordered 10 bottles of juice. One was ok to use. The others are dark amber, taste peppery and seem off.
I added a photo of what I usually get and what I was sent.

I emailed twice and no response. Shame, seems a lot of the negative reviews are feeling the drop in service.

Edit. Order #414521; I ordered from them many times in the past! This time I ordered and it has sat there with label created for 5 days now! Reached out and they said the post office has lost package and now they are out of stuff I ordered! I got a full refund! I do understand what everyone says about being able to contact them, it is hard to get them to respond to email timely! They really should have a number you can call; Initially, I had thought that this place was a walk-up store, so I showed up and tried to go inside, but the place is an office, apparently, and it was locked. I contacted customer service about this, and they got back to me, eventually, telling me that they do mail order only, which ends up being okay; I was just hoping to get a deal on a Geek Bar, but I ended up going to another shop in town, where I was able to get a good price on a Geek Bar.; have been ordering from vjd for a couple of years with no problems and great customer service, but things have obviously changed with this company. placed an order from them 8 days ago and received the tracking# the same day. when I track my order, all I get is ""acceptance pending"". tried numerous times to contact customer service for some help with this issue and to try and find out what the problem is, but no response. used to be a legit company. customer service is a joke! and I am out $100!; I'm dealing with similar issues to VJD's recent reviews. I've ordered from them in the past and the experience was great, but not this time.
I placed an order 9 days ago and received tracking information, and the status hasn't updated since. I reached out to the company and got a response the next day saying it may have been misplaced at the ""courier's facility"" and that it would be reshipped. About an hour later, I got a message saying part of my order was refunded, but still no tracking updates.
Cut to today (3 days later) and there still hasn't been any movement on the shipment, and my last email remains unresponded to. The shipping reference number they included in their initial response was the same as the first tracking number I had received, which is weird because they said they were reshipping it, so I have no idea what's going on. I've tried calling their local number and still haven't gotten any help."

Love that I  can pop in and get their products the same day! The employees in phx are awesome. Been using the Mi-pod 2.0+ for 6mo. Best device yet that helped me finally quit smoking! That and the Mad Hatter, I love salts; classic tobacco!; I did business with these people for quite sometime. They don’t stand by their word. They sell expired vapes, and they don’t refund you for what don’t sell like they promise. I’d never do business w them again!; Orders take up to 18 BUSINESS days to arrive. Nowhere on the site was that info relayed. Expectations were definitely changed since I was unaware. I truly believe somewhere on the website it should give the timeline. Having a generic ""ship within 48 hours,"" gives an illusion of receiving products within a week or so.; I bought a MiPod pro at a little shop in Fresno. Cartridges are lasting 3-5 weeks before needing replacement and I'm using 1/6th of the juice I was prior & completely quit tobacco. Horrified that it took so long to find your brand. Love it.  Just wish you shipped to Indiana.; Been ordering for awhile from mipod, but not anymore. My last order I had enough points for a $15 discount so I used it and 24hrs later my order was cancelled so I called to find out why because there was nothing in the email stating why it was cancelled and they said it was a fraudulent purchase and now my points are gone. I tried reordering and the points were gone, they were consistent enough to flag that one as fraudulent as well. Pretty strange that my orders all went through fine when I didn’t use points. All orders were on the same card delivering to the same address. There’s better retailers out there that actually will let you use the points you accrue, I’d suggest looking for them and are quite cheaper."

They do a great job.  I have had no issue with product missing like I do with many other wholesalers.  They ship out either the same day or next day so packages arrive on time.  I personally deal with BJ and he is quite thorough and takes care of anything we need when we are running low on hardware.  They also carry many items that other wholesalers do not which is great.  These guys are a 5 star all day.  Thanks.; We love LA Vapor! We are in the midwest so shipping usually takes a week. Customer service is awesome. We've only had 1 order from them where the wrong item was sent but they remedied the situation with a solution that we were both pleased with. I didn't have to send back the incorrect item which was awesome. They made the whole process hassle free. If you're looking for a supplier for vape kits and accessories, give them a chance! I noticed they are expanding their inventory to include glass so head shops can benefit from shopping here as well.; Love the products and customer service is always A+. They always got the good deals!; We Love LA Vapor. We Celebrate 5 years in business this month and they've been our Main supplier since our doors opened. Customer service is next to none, they consistently carry the latest and greatest and the at the same time they show support for older devices and coils. They'll Match competition prices but I can Guarantee you wont find better pricing. If your not ordering with LA Vapor you are not doing it right.; Buyer beware!
Normally I don’t write reviews but this is unacceptable. 90% of my order was never shipped, I did not receive any notifications what so ever of it being out of stock, nor did I receive any form of refund. They even charged me for my second order without having the products in stock, and never credited my previous order. It seems like this company just takes your money knowing they don’t have the items in stock.
Never had an issue with Juice Supply Company."

I placed an order last week to have it delivered to my address in Jamaica, NY. Over the weekend I saw it was delivered to Las Vegas??? I've tried calling their phone line multiple times and haven't been able to get anyone on the phone. I tried emailing their email address as they claim I'll get a faster response and have emailed them just about every day this week and have got zero responses to any of them.  I doubt I'll ever get ahold of anyone who can supply me with a refund so I guess I should just consider myself ripped off.  Don't order anything from these crooks; Im glad I gave them a chance! I was really hesitant, based off other reviews, to order from here. However, my experience was fantastic, and I must give credit where it is due. Order processed and shipped out the next day. Order was delivered 4 days after order was placed. So far, no known issues with the product. Very satisfied with my purchase, the cost, and fast delivery. I will be ordering again soon!; I ordered five items and only received 3.  I have tried to get assistance but customer support has been non existent. Shipping was slow.  They make it real easy to make a purchase, but nearly impossible to get any support.  Will not purchase from them again.; Zero contact cannot send a request on their website as it gives an error. Ordered Aug 27th it is currently the 4th and still no word on my order. Will never do business again

Update 9/6 i have sent multiple emails asking where my order is or if it can just be canceled and still no response. Online it shows order is processing yet website says most orders processed same day. Guess I wasn't a lucky one. Going to dispute this charge with  ard company; Their website says that orders put in by 12 PM will be sent out the same day, but trust them on that. I ordered 5 days ago and it still hasn't shipped. You can't get a hold of anyone to ask what is going on either. I've submitted a form on the website, sent emails, and called a dozen times but no one ever picks up. Absolute scam"

Rather limited selection of juice compared to other places I've been.  The prices were ridiculous, however.  Especially if you are looking for Farm Bill 2018 compliant THC products.  ($90 for a two gram disposable?!?, I'll order from Delta 8 resellers . com and wait a couple days for delivery, thanks.)

Bill was very courteous, offered us a military discount, and then failed to provide said discount.  I am not the type to push an issue, I'll just vote with my dollar better in the future....

I will not return to this location.  Not even once; The inside is clean. The staff are friendly. Selection is pretty small. Especially when it comes to vape coils. Though probably adequate for the area.

The absolute biggest problem is the cost. I've seen a few people mention their great prices and I'm not sure what smoke shops they've been to, but Fallen Forge is waaaay over priced. Smokes shops are expensive in general, and you're going to pay more at Fallen Forge than the majority of other shops. Upwards of 50% more on some items.

If you absolutely need some juice or a disposable, it'll work in a pinch, but if you can, wait until you make a trip elsewhere.

EDIT
As Fallen Forge has gotten more established, their prices have come down a bit, and their selection has improved, and continues to improve. They're doing a great job at improving their business. Though sadly their point system for free disposable vapes has gone away. At no fault of their own, but still a disappointment.; Honestly the nicest staff I've met at any vape shop I've ever been to, and they have a really nice selection of disposables that's constantly growing.; 3000 Puffs for almost $40 and 5000 puffs for basically $45. You can go to any other vape shop in Utah and buy a 3000 puff Hype bar for $15-$20. I advise you just buy a few any time you go through any nearby vape shop, other than Fallen Forge. I was very let down and disappointed. NOT WORTH IT!; Great people working there. Good place to find kratom :) And I'm grateful to have a shop in between the big cities. Appreciated the veterans discount."

I was googling a disposable vape that I had tried from a local vape store because the kind I wanted was out of stock..and Huff and Puffers (what a great name) popped up. The prices are slightly cheaper than stores near me, I live in Decatur Alabama. The flavors choices are incredible and there are so many different ones to choose from. I picked the 8 that I wanted, paid for them, and in less than a week I had them! From Cali to Bama is a long distance so I knew shipping would take a little bit and that was fine. I was updated by email when they shipped and UPS is faster than regular postal service.

I placed my order Monday and it arrived today (Wednesday) with no issues. Everything was received complete and the customer service I received from Tammy at H&P HQ was top notch and answered all my questions about the delivery.; The first thing I’ll say is I will definitely be a repeat customer, the prices are very good and products are just as good. I was able to get 2 whole VooPoo vapes, 2 juices, and 2 packs of coils for like $6 more than I paid JUST for my previous vape with no coils or juice. The contact from the company providing information on my package was spectacular, and consistent. I was a little bummed about how long it took to get my package but I think that was because of the time of day I ordered it, then to add an additional day UPS had a delay, so I don’t feel I can fault H&P exactly.

Later Homie... see ya again on our next trip out!; Love coming here, Billy always greets me when I come in!!!; First off, thanks to all the people there for what they do! Having just recently gotten back into vaping, this was my first stop and I’m glad it was. The staff was not only friendly, outgoing, and more than willing to answer any questions, but were more than knowledgeable and helped catch me up to everything that changed since I last was vaping (about 8-10 years ago). They helped me find a set up that absolutely works perfect for me and I’m loving. And the variety of juices, Ease of ordering, and quick turnaround is amazing as well. Definitely will recommend to anyone looking for a new spot or For a spot to go if starting up vaping ( I know of a couple)"

Krave is a good brand, but they did not have much of a selection. There are much better places to go for what you need than this unfriendly store.; Men that work there was incredibly unhelpful. It seemed as if I was bothering him with my presence. Poor experience overall. For a more pricey vape this store was a big thumbs down. Save your money and go somewhere else.; The guy with the glasses and afro that works there was rude and literally cussed becuase I asked him to help me with a different vape juice.

For this they get 2 stars. I noticed the selection available is mild-medium always a bummer but anyone can find something to get them by. In this case the staff member actually didn’t offer any assistance or recommendations and maybe I’m one who just doesn’t know that much about vapes or juices I mean are so many to choose from and that’s why he was rude and unprofessional. I would never recommend this location.; Bought a Vaporesso XROS 3 and a pack of cartridges 4 days ago, cartridges burn out within 6 hours when online it says that they should last close to 2 weeks which seller confirmed. Before I bought,  I asked if I can return it if it isn’t working . Seller (made an impression that she is a store owner) said yes and gave me a receipt. Today I came in trying to get a return and she told me that the device is working as designed and that I have to “wait for a couple minutes between the puffs for cotton to absorb liquid” it says nothing about it in directions that came with the unit or in any of the online reviews. I wasn’t abusing a unit I primed cartridges for at least an hour before using it and was taking 2-3 good puffs  every 10-15 minutes. Either she is selling counterfeit Chinese copies  or sold me a bad unit, regardless that was the last time I shopped there. And she didn’t even give me an itemized receipt.; N2's staff is top-notch! They hooked me up with awesome tips to enhance the flavor of my vape, especially the killer blueberry option. This spot is my local go-to for all things vaping. Big shoutout for staying open on Sundays! Super stoked about the speedy service, too. Keep rocking it! 🙌💨; ***STAY AWAY***Came here once. Shop is pretty empty and no prices were listed on anything or any shelf. First red flag Bought a vape. It was $27.00 before tax. The vape stopped working, came back within a week, told him about the issue, was told nothing he can do. Okay fine, well I’d like to by another one. He says okay $38.26. Excuse me, but the price I paid 3 days earlier was $27 before taxes. Now your saying it’s $34.99 before taxes. Was told I was lying, like bro. Just missed out on a good customer, I hate how shiesty shops like this don’t post prices on the shelves before they charge different people different prices. Lost what could have been a reliable customer but to be honest the shop is empty, have a total of 3 different vapes to choose from, horrible flavors with minimal choices. Might as well be running a kiosk cart at a mall; Nice people. The house juices aren't bad... Generally good selection of premiums. Rewards program is pretty nice. They usually have some cool stuff on sale for super cheap."

Thanks again for the great experience. Will definitely be shopping with you again.; Great service, pricing, and quick delivery.  Johnathan is our new rep and he has been awesome. Never more than a text or call away and always responds quick and takes action.  Their customer appreciation is out of this world. I was able to go in and pick from a bunch of items for absolutely free as part of their recent customer appreciation effort.   Can't say enough good things about them. Johnathan even gave me a chance to meet and shake hands with the management team. All really cool people with good attitudes (you know how some vape reps think they are too cool).   Not these guys!

I purchased a vape that turned out to be defective due to it leaking. The young employee did not know how to assist with the assembly or add the flavored e-liquid and video conferenced the owner. I made my purchase and off I was to the beach. While using it, it began to leak so after my visit to the beach I stopped back in and advised the young employee of the vape having a leak issue. I advised I wanted to upgrade because I didn't want to have the same issue. I had the employee test the upgrade and she once again didn't know how to operate/fill the vape so, she once again conferenced called the owner,  she explained the issue with the first vape, then out of nowhere I hear her saying she's coming to the store. The owner and another lady walked in, took the upgraded vape, started treating her employee (who was her sister) very rudely because she didn't according to her fill the vape correctly (mind you she, the owner, was telling her what to do via video chat).  She checked the vape, spoke to me like I was annoying her, makes a very ignorant statement of you can't tip the vape....my response....um lady, you have to slightly tip it to hit it.

Thank goodness before I purchased the upgraded vape I noticed the box was missing the second cartridge. The other vapes were also missing items and according to her they were new. Very rude and unprofessional how she spoke with me, but what was upsetting was her treatment of her employee,
who was her sister. She asked me what the original price for my first purchase was and stormed out the store. No, goodbye, apologies or thank you for your business.

I would suggest training your employees on the items you're selling if you can't be bothered to be at the store. Also, just because it's your sister it doesn't mean she should be humiliated in front of customers.

Buyer beware, check the merchandise very carefully as boxes are not factory sealed upon purchase and are missing items.  All of the Lux vapes were missing the second cartridge, yet they were ""new"", none were factory sealed, now even the first one I purchased. BTW, none of the vapes had the instructions in the boxes.; The first place I found on the West coast of the island that sells the smokes I'm used to getting stateside. Pay your tribute to the Indian at the door for good luck!; Top of the line at there kinda, very friendly staff and really good price.; Went for a new vape kit and the experience was amazing.; What ever you smoke, they have the EQUIPMENT!😉"

The guy behind the counter was super helpful and I appreciate it when folks behind the counter treat me as if they want my business. I may look around for a shop with a larger selection but it’s good to know that they do have salts on hand.; Selection is okay shop in a pinch, although prices are high for nearly everything and there are no deals for purchasing multiple juices (like many other shops).

Not sure if they are clearing room for a large shipment, trying to get rid of older inventory, or getting ready to close down. The inventory was probably older as the CBD cartridges were crystallized, which I was told by the employee was due to the quality of the ingredients (which as far as I know it is not, it is indicative of a cartridge sitting in one place for a while). Other than that statement, the employee didn't seem to be very knowledgeable of anything despite her friendly demeanor. I think she was just a family member filling in as the store was getting ready to close.

Prices seemed on the higher side individually, but so long as the sale is going some savvy purchases would make you come out ahead of other stores' prices. There were some nice binders with prices and inventory listed, something more stores should do for those who just want a quick idea of what's on the menu.

Show you my recent best work partner.  lol; The customer service provided by this shop is truly remarkable. In case you encounter any problems with their products, they not only respond promptly but also go the extra mile to rectify the situation. I genuinely admire their strong ethical values in conducting business. It is my hope that they are not being exploited by anyone, as it is a rarity to find a company that genuinely listens to its customers and willingly offers refunds for legitimate concerns. Moreover, their shipping is swift, and the rewards program is highly beneficial. I wholeheartedly recommend utilizing their website for purchasing products and wish them abundant success in their future endeavors!"

My most recent visit was amazing. I live in utah and don't have these options there. I realized I was going to be a little late and passed their closing time so I called ahead and asked if he could wait for me to get there. Eli was so amazing, so friendly, so helpful. He even helped me put my new vape together and show me how to do it correctly . I've never had anybody offer to do that for me. He's awesome. Let alone his boss Geoffrey is the best too. If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would.; I love this vape shop!!! Geoff is very friendly and knowledgeable, and helpful. If ypu tell him ypur flavor profiles he has recommendations.

I usually make my own liquid and just buy some ready made as a treat. So I brought a supply of my home made juice over with me, however we extended our visit for an extra week so I ran short. I went to Elite Vapes where I was impressed by the selection and the friendly, helpful staff. I ended up buying 3 bottles of ""near dated"" juice - not a problem to me, it'll be used very soon and it saved me 50%. I had been to a couple of other stores before visiting Elite Vapes and as a foreign visitor I have to say I was startled at the high price of juice over here, quite a bit more than I'm used to paying in the UK, also nobody seemed to do any discounts for multiple purchases which is something quite common back home. So yeah, ""close out"" stock not an issue for me, happy with my purchase, flavours are great and more than anything else just great friendly service in store. I'll be back next time I'm over here. Thank you.; A lot of their stock is old and not usable. I know they carry a ton of flavors but maybe they should drop most of their brands and focus on a few, rather than trying to have every brand and flavor in stock. A lot of it sits and becomes discolored and the quality suffers. I can tell because certain flavors from other shops will be either clear, or have a slight amber color to it, and that same product from elite vapes will be dark yellow or brown in color. The only explanation must be that their stock is old and if you ask to return it after the bottle has been opened they won't accept a return. Some of their staff definitely show disdain for some customers as well, which is always a bummer.; Updated: costumer service has been much better.

It’s nice because they’re close but the prices are high and they never seem to have the nic levels available. There’s always 4-5 people in there but the costumer service always seems contempuos. The please and thank yous are there but it’s like they want you out to finish their conversations. I recommend you know what you want and get out.; Been vaping for over a year now and this is my go to place. Not only because it's close (there's a few more actually closer) but because the people usually make me feel like a friend. I've gotten most of my mods and all my tanks and all my juices from this store. Whenever I have questions, they always answer with honesty and experience.

Online can be cheaper in most instances with devices, but I'd rather support my local shop and I go here instead and pay the extra.; Mitch, Markie, Austin helped me get my batteries re wrapped and taught me about battery safety. The employees are very knowledgeable and friendly. The answered all of my questions with ease.
They have a large selection of juices and many other vape products. they have an area where you can clean your vape and charge your batteries if needed. This will now be my main vape shop."

Shop employees did not want to replace it or anything, when the purchase was made literally an hour or two before trying to get a new one. Even made it auto fire by itself in front of them and they refused any service.; Strange customer service like Ryan and others said. Other shops offer friendlier service.

They always have some sort of deal going on which is a huge plus. I was new to vaping and Connor took his time to explain the basics and helped me find products tailored to my needs and my flavor preference. He also always has good flavor recommendations.

I’ve heard of people having fakes but I’ve never run into them before. It was also $10 more than I usually pay. $40 down the drain. Insert sad face emoji here.
***update*** I went back in and showed them the difference in the vape colors and he actually gave me a refund….very reluctantly. He was really nice about it so…thank you; Tried to place an order through their website. Went as far as making the purchase. Usually within a couple of days they’ll start processing your order, but them nope nada nothing! I called and sent emails asking about my order and got no response. Called again, nothing. So I had to cancel the order through PayPal because they sure as hell wouldn’t. Why? Why? Have a website? Why? If you’re not gonna process the orders do away with website! That’s just lame! Makes you wonder how many orders are just sitting there and nothing being done about.; Fake Flum!!!! 6k puff tan out in 2 days burnt out and made me feel sick. Compared to my other pebbles and they look different. Also was around $10 more than they normally are. Dangerous and upsetting.; They sell fake Flum Float vapes. I bought two lush ice flums at this store and both had an issue with continuing to burn after I take a hit. After comparing to my roomates vape purchased at a different smoke shop and calling around to  other reliable smoke shops, I came to the conclusion this wasn’t legit. The one I purchased here burnt out in two days and had a copyright insignia while my roomates and the other shops have a trademark. The real ones are also significantly heavier.; I really don’t like giving negative reviews,, especially of small businesses.  However I keep trying to give this place another shot, but literally EVERY time I go in there I get completely ripped off. Everything is behind the counter or in a glass case (as it should be in tobacco shop). I usually have to wait forever to be helped by an employee. They act like they’re knowledgeable, but TWICE now they’ve sold me the wrong product.  Their vape devices are heavily overpriced to begin with, but on one particular occasion, the price tag on the device I was purchasing was mis-labeled with that of a different, much higher priced manufacturer.  I brought it to their attention, and they said yes, it was a mistake… and they proceeded to raise the price even higher by $10.  It was factory sealed, so I couldn’t even look at the actual item inside the box before purchasing it. The employee assured me it was the color/design I described, but only briefly held up the box so I could try and read it myself.  After paying over their inflated price, I got to my car, opened the box, only to discover it wasn’t anything close to what I had asked for. Of course, as most stores do, they have a strict NO REFUND policy on opened items.  That was a waste of $80.
Last week I stopped in there just to get a new cartridge for one of my devices.  Which are all kept behind the counter.  It wasn’t busy in there at all, and I even showed the employee my actual device in which I needed the cartridge for.
Of course, I get home, open it up and discover it’s the WRONG one.
I’m so sick of repeatedly getting ripped off by incompetent employees at that place.
It’s not worth the convenience.  If you drive a couple miles further south down Oceanside blvd, there’s much better vape shops. Most all decent vape shops will actually take the time to show you the device, and even open up the box so you see it BEFORE purchasing it.
If you’re looking for a really great vape shop, I recommend Cloudhaven Vapors on Oceanside Blvd instead.  They have amazing customer service and much better pricing. They always seem to have exactly what I’m looking for in stock, their employees are friendly, knowledgable and always take the time to ensure you’re purchasing the right item.  I’ve always walked out of there happy and it’s definitely worth the extra drive."

But the dude that's been there both times I've gone in just seems SUPER ANNOYED that anybody comes in. Like, he was very curt in his answers and just didn't seem to want to be helpful. He seemed agitated when I needed explanation on sizes and stuff.

I don't know if I'll be back in here. I don't like going to places that make me feel unwelcome.; If you still user higher ohm coils, you know how difficult it can be to find the right juice. After hearing what I wanted, the clerk suggested I try Kilo juice. The 30ml bottles are $8 and do the trick.

I was just passing through and picked this business because it had two locations and that seems to be more reliable.  I should have known as they were way overpriced as well.

But the lady working when my boyfriend and I came to visit could not have been less interested in helping us.

Any time I had a question about a product, she barely listened and just showed me the item and the price. I felt rushed and like I wasn't allowed to look around at the things. Would give a five star rating if their staff seemed to care! Neverlow may charge more but their staff actually know about the products and are very happy to assist you.; Sold me a defective product and won’t answer the phone. I bought this 10 min ish ago.; Store is ok, but the cashiers never have change and will steal extra money from you if you don't have exact change. I purchased some incense and a couple other things and it came to $7.16 all I had was a $10 bill. The cashier said he didn't have coins so he kept the $.84 and gave me back $2.00. Thats stealing money from customers.; Super clean friendly and they won't let you leave the store without small test drive for some products. Definitely ensures you will not go home with a dud!

They deserve minus  1,000 stars.; I used to enjoy this smoke shop a lot! They used to be so sweet and had the BEST customer service towards me but recently all of this has gone downhill. To the point I’m gonna have to find a new smoke shop out in Maricopa. The female is rude to all heck, doesn’t talk unless you ask a question but if you do you’ll get NOTHING but attitude for no reason.

I will never return to this shop....; So last year I bought a nice glass bong from them and "" accidentally got double charged"" ok so sometimes that happens.
Today, I went there to get a new glass bong, the blonde girl was helping me, she wrapped it up in bubble wrap and put it in the bag. When I got home (98 miles away) the bong had no stem, somebody just put a large blow on it, so I called to ask them to send me one, both her and the manager told me that I was wrong they don't sell them without a stem, I said I know what a stem looks like and there isn't one on this bong, he again told me they don't sell them without a stem and I was wrong.  I got super frustrated with him and just hung up, that's probably what they really wanted me to do anyway.

Just beware of this place it's really shady.; The staff at this place suck at customer service! I will not go there no more! They don't even acknowledge you when you walk in! The last 2 times they have done this, I am done with this place and I will always recommend the vape shop next to bashas! They are so much better!!

The blonde chick has the worst customer service, she is the main reason why I will never spend my money there again!"

On my most recent visit we came in later at night close to closing and Isiah didn’t make us feel rushed and in fact made a number of very good suggestions and honest opinions on our new mods and disposables. It was well coming the extra distance to come to the 7h St location. Thank you Isiah for the excellent service and experience! 10/10"

Upon entering the establishment you can expect to be greeted with a smile. Also, if you frequent this shop often, you will find your usual purchase waiting for you at the register. The workers are personable and very knowledgeable of the merchandise they carry; what ever it is you are looking for they most likely have it but if they don’t they usually have something of equal quality for a great price. Speaking of which, they offer great deals and sometimes promotional offers, and if you are like me and go through vapes fast, they always have sales on select brands in a variety of flavors.

My most recent purchase is the vape in the photo I have provided, 6000 puffs for $8.99. Tastes pretty good and for the cost of what I normally buy which is almost 3 times as much, a part of me feels slightly guilty like I’m ripping them off. 🙀

But seriously, if you’re in the area check them out. You won’t be disappointed.

They also carry drinks and snacks if you’re just passing through.; **UPDATE** If I can put a 0 star rating I would. Had a great conversation with the guy who did my transaction too my mom and I were very chill with him and even laughed at some jokes that were made. I just bought 3 vapes from this store and got 2 of them for free today, NONE OF THEM have flavor in them. IF YOU SEE A SIGN IN THE FRONT OF THE REGISTER THAT SAYS “Find out how to get a free vape :)” DO NOT DO IT. And do NOT fall for the half priced vapes, they are half priced for a reason, waste of time and money. NONE of them have flavor. Disappointed because this was my go to store for 8 years. I do not think I will be coming back ):; Came for our first visit after referred by a friend. The staff are nice and patient when you don’t know what you want. Will be back for more vapes and smoking supplies.; Amazing service and very friendly staff. Great vape selection too. Zane is wonderful.; I really like Waves! They are about 18 minutes from me and I pass by a lot of other shops on the way here. It’s always clean. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly  100% recommend!"

Henry was great and got my friend her battery and we also were able to purchase some Juicy hemp wraps and gummies. She was happy that they had a good selection of Juul pods. The shop is located near 2 medical marijuana dispensaries so they seem to cater to both vaping and marijuana users. I'm not into vaping but the service was really great and they also had some cool clothing that the owner designed with the same logo. I purchased a really cool army fatigue jacket and saw a couple of cute shirts but unfortunately they didn't have my size available. We hung out for a while listening to music and just chatting with the workers about local food spots to try. Definitely recommend!; The staff are very knowledgeable of all the products they referred me to juicy jay hemp wraps smoked nice and slow even on the beach; Great selection compared to some of the other CBD stores I’ve tried in the area. Henry is always very helpful and makes great suggestions. This is definitely my go-to smoke shop in San Juan.; I was in Calle Loiza, San Juan with my wife for vacation and stopped by to some new hardware and Juices. My current Smok pen was leaking, therefore I decided to upgrade. What caught my eye, about this particular vape shop was the style and environment that it was vibrating within the area.  So I walked in and  the spoke with the owner Carlos, told him about my current vape issue and he recommended the Aegis legend, which is box mod designed to be water and shock resistant. So far I have no issues with its durability. I also tried one of the new juice brands I never tried, and Carlos put me on the Cush Man Mango Strawberry flavor, and it fits my flavor style. My overall, thought on the place is that  here you get great service combined with  super knowledgeable staff and great environment! The spot has almost a Amsterdam cafezique  vibe  and think that one of its selling points. There seating around the store where, you can chat and shoot the breeze with the owner, who is also highly knowledgeable about the area and other hot spots. His recommendations  was on point out side the vaping topics, So I highly recommended dropping by and taking a look at the merchandise.; Rico was the best help and assisted me through the entire process of finding the flavor and style of vape I liked"

However, i did not check products til hours later only to find all carts were half empty. When i did try the cartridges, they were very harsh and had very mild affects. I paid almost 200$ for 2 carts that were half empty (i purchased 3, only one was full)

I did not feel like making huge deal, but i felt that you should know to check your products before you get too far. Unfortunately i was traveling around and didnt have the time to complain or attempt to return. I visited two other dispensaries on the island and have paid less for more and better products.; Associates are welcoming 🙏 and the store has great deals.

Cleanliness I'd give 5 stars on same with the service part. Thank you again Vapor 42.; They make their own juices, if the milligram is too low, they can raise it themselves in shop, because of making their own juices they're able to sell for a much cheaper price than local competitors. Most importantly they are some of the most friendly and supportive people I've ever met in a commercial setting, especially with me struggling to quit cigarettes and having very little knowledge about vaping... The manager and the young lady who helped me have always been able to explain any question I have and get me the best product I need for my needs. I'll never go anywhere else.

I have stopped smoking cigarettes with the help of this store. Great prices of pouches and flum pebble.; I always been a regular of another shop however they raised their price but that wasn’t the reason I stop going. Everytime when I seek for certain brands and flavors, they are out of stock. I went to Apple to get a phone and started searching for vape place near me. This store came up. I was shocked. It felt so calm in this store with their design. Another thing I love is how the employee and owner are amazing. They are so friendly not like other store, just charge u and let you go. The owner even chatted with me offered me water and snack while talking. I got an Elf bar, she took her time to explain how to see if it is counterfeit and her store elf bar price is great. In a place like Santa Monica, her price is amazing. Service, price beats it all. This is now my new store.; great experience in malibu. much better prices than the Chevron up the road.; I recently had the pleasure of visiting v365 and I couldn't be more impressed. The moment I walked in, I was greeted by a warm and friendly staff (Yvonne) she was not only knowledgeable but genuinely passionate about their products.

What truly sets v365 apart is their commitment to customer service. Yvonne took the time to answer my questions and provide recommendations based on my preferences. Her willingness to educate and help customers find the perfect products is truly commendable.

I was also impressed by the clean and inviting atmosphere of the shop. It's clear that they take pride in maintaining a welcoming environment for all customers.; Yvonne was the best!!!! I went to this shop for the first time and she was friendly first meeting her hur :) she made our experience feel pleasant and friendly. I will definitely be back here!"

The staff is awesome  and kind. We highly recommend this place, if you're in Riverside or surrounding areas, stop by. They have what you're looking for lol.; Hands down the best damn smoke shop not even just so cal either, its the best period with no other competitors evwn close! Widest selection of glass, vapes, snacks, and gear. If you cant find something you like here then your obviously blind! The inventory is always rotating which is a good thing and means the business is thriving! Have built a relationship with AJ now and anytime im going to spend more than $20 i spend it here! Has everything dreams are made of and if they dont have it they will get it for you! Also ive never met a smoke shop owner that is as knowledgable about every single product they stock!!!
Thank you AJ and Platinum for taking my thousands of dollars and i dont regret spending even one of them!; this is my new go-to. There's at least one guy there that knows the stuff inside and out (I haven't interacted with anyone else yet so the other employees may know their stuff too) and it didn't feel like he was just trying to dump the most expensive things on me. He asked questions and made sensible recommendations on a tank and salt nic that I was very pleased with. If anyone asks me if there's a smoke/vape shop close by, I will be recommending them to this place.; Hands down the best smoke shop I've ever been to. Very professional knowledgeable crew that will definitely get you the help and product knowledge you seek.
They got great competing prices that helps get customers the beast deals in town. I definitely recommend visiting this place.; Literally 5/5, no 10/5, stars for Platinum. Anything you could imagine and even some stuff you couldn't. But it's AJ, an employee, that really ties the store together. Want to test a bong you're interested in and that terp slurp you want? He'll fill it up with the perfect amount of water to show its function. And lastly, their prices are amazing. For example, Rodeo was selling the new aleaf nectar collector for 120, while Platinum had the same ones for 60 (that's the same price as aleaf sells them for on their site). Do I need to say more?"

I was greeted by the owner Brandon who was extremely helpful and knowledgeable on the subject of vaping and e juices.  Brandon and Ryan assisted me with finding the right liquid for my taste and needs,  and they were both very patient with my picky taste buds.  Just based on their customer service I will continue to go to this store for all my vaping needs.  But that's not where it stops, the store is self transports you to an different Era and really makes you feel comfortable.  Their menu is very extensive, and they know about every juice they have.  Also the menu is leather bound which adds a very nice touch.  They built and designed every part of the decor and that really adds to the experience.

Excellent in stock selection of mods, juices and accessories. Knowledgeable staff is always friendly and willing to help---whether that includes education, finding devices that best fit your needs, or sampling juice varieties.

The online juice bulk sellers have taken over a huge portion of the market space, especially after california's vapor related bans and legislation.

Highly recommend supporting your local vape shop during these turbulent times, and make sure they can continue serving the community in the future. :); MY go to vapor shop. The juices they carry are the best tasting I have found. All the guys are always kind to me and very professional, not to mention very honest. Not the same experience at other "" spots"". to each their own I guess... but this shop has my support! They don't act cheap (which was mentioned in an earlier comment). They always change my cotton to try stuff on my mod, let me know of sales and have given me freebies too! They go out of their way to help me. love them!; I am blown away by the level of customer service here at Venice Vapor Lab! A friend and I came in on our lunch break looking to pick up some new juices. We were helped by a guy named Lucas, he was really professional and recommended juices to us based off of what we liked. He offered to change my cotton and got me set up with my new juice before I left. Hands down the best service I ever received at a vape spot. Highly recommended!"

The clerk behind the counter was super friendly and helpful.

I asked if they had a dynavap to a water pipe adapter and they did not have one in stock, but the clerk figured out a solution by using a dab cup (I think they called it)—the rubber dab cup fit the dynavap and sealed to my bowel really well. great experience

Oh and the prices were great; This is the only place in the Valley I trust as my one stop shop when I need to buy a new vape, pick up pods or buy juice as the staff is always top notch, knowledgeable and friendly and the selection of fine juice as well as sale options is unbeatable! I’ve been a loyal customer since I first switched to vaping back in 2018 and regardless if I’m in Tempe or if I have to wait to fly back Ohio or Vegas I always make sure to stock up at HQ before and after traveling as no place I’ve seen in Arizona, Ohio, Nevada, California or South Carolina has been able to hold a candle to the service, selection and knowledge I’ve come to rely on as an HQ customer!; Literally recommend this place to everyone the people who work here actually care and are so nice and helpful !! the girl with her nails always slaying is so nice and the guy with the glasses is very informative and sweet!!; I was born in Tempe which is rare as only 20% of us remain here. In saying that I am expressing that I've been a customer of this establishment off and on for nearly three decades. I also live on this block.
Three ladies were working tonight. They were employees that I have been served by before. Each time they represented the rudest people I have ever seen employed, not only here, but anywhere near Mill Avenue. I am only slightly aware of the owner but certainly aware enough to know that this is not the type of staff that he usually has working here. I have a substantial level of local notoriety due to my history in the entertainment business over the last 4 decades. I also ran businesses at this intersection for quite some time. I thought I had the worst staff to ever work near Mill Avenue. That record has now been overcome by the staff working at HQ tonight. In the last couple of years I have shifted my business over to Wild Side. There is an incentive in doing that because they keep their vape juice prices below the competitors. What would keep a budget customer coming to HQ, even with higher prices, would be the quality of the staff. I know this more than anyone else in Tempe, because my own talents were what kept customers coming to my businesses even with our higher prices and undependable staff. These three ladies working at HQ tonight, plus one other that was working on the evening of April 20th, are pretty bad. I understand that finding staff to actually do a job is hard enough these past few years. Expecting anyone to actually care about customers is probably asking too much. However, HQ Vape & Smoke has managed to do that over the years until recently.
My hope is that Wild Side will do better with their ordering so I don't have a need to go to HQ anymore. It would be a win-win. Save money and get treated with respect. I'm not sure if the employees at HQ were born here. Considering their age, that is a possibility. However, they would not be old enough to understand that those of us that were born here in the last 50 years and have been here for decades are sick of the poor quality people coming into the area. We are the customers they should make themselves aware of because we are the ones who will be most offended. One needs to keep in mind that it is the people who have been here who have made Tempe the desirable place that it is and that has attracted so many people to want to come live here. The families who have been here throughout the 20th century have worked hard to make Tempe what it has become. There are not many of us left. Those of us that are don't appreciate newcomers or careless modern local youth who participate in making this area undesirable with their attitudes and behaviors. Furthermore, we have an increasing population of foreign students who are not used to the way an average American may act. Like I expressed to Chase bank, we are a multicultural metropolis that requires people who work in service to have skills appropriate for this area and are appropriate people in general to be exposed to that student population.
For no other reason than the simple fact that we worked hard to make this part of Tempe what it is today. We would prefer our efforts not be spoiled by service staff who think they are working in any random shop. This is a historic area with a special culture. It would behoove anyone who works on this block to learn a bit about the area that they also partake of and benefit from living or working in.
If they don't believe in these facts I have stated about how special Tempe is, just have them go ask all the transients outside.
I don't recommend anyone replace their staff, but I will say that if HQ were to lose these employees ... they wouldn't be missed."

Unfortunately they do not have control over parking since they are located near other businesses and the stairs to climb are a tremendous work out.

Justin was more than professiojnal and helpful during this whole process; Very knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. They recommended a device similar to my dying device and I'm very happy with it.
They know all the technical details and easily adapted to my level of understanding. My ohm knowledge was 5 years old and they helped me catch up.

I make my own juice and they taught me about the current nicotines available for purchase.

Tobacco lobbyists make it harder and harder to control our nicotine levels. Write to your representatives.; These guys are top notch in their customer service!

Red Star Vapor is now my ultimate destination for all my vaping needs. The location is consistently spotless with an incredible atmosphere. Not to mention, their selection is truly amazing, and their customer service is impeccable. And don't you dare forget to sign up for their rewards program!; I really appreciate the effort that the staff takes to make you feel welcome and appreciated.  I would recommend this store more than the one on 51ave. They allow you to test the product before leaving the store to make sure that your product works properly,  highly recommend anyone to make the drive I don’t regret driving far for the customer service; I have dealt with a great deal of smoke shops and most of them are the same cookie cutter set up.  Red Star Vapor is different. Not only do they make great flavors, they will help you to find ones that you loved from somewhere else and have now discontinued.  They will find a flavor that is surprisingly close to your favorite, continuing to satisfy you.  With multiple different strengths, and additives to get your juice just the way you want is a great specialty.  I know because this is what happened to me.
So I call before coming in to make sure my flavor which is high in demand is available and 99% of the time it is.  Red Star Vapor  knows their customers, my shopping habits and usual times I refill, so I can count on them too keep my favorites in stock,   which I greatly appreciate.  They are pleasant, educated, and knowledgeable, making their customers continually happy.  It is nice not to have to call multiple places and /or call and drive all over to find what you want, especially at a great price. I won't go anywhere else as the REWARDS alone are worth every trip.

Definitely my new go-to shop!; Red Star is an interesting situation

You save a prolific amount of money ordering online as opposed to the store front. However your savings is eaten up by the shipping cost.

If you only need one or two items, there is no winning situation.

It's best to build a larger order and just order online if you can do that.

The ultimate downside to this strategy is that you have to wait longer and longer for that amazing Wyatt Earp or Morley Red juice.

The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. That makes up for the higher price to some degree.; Always great service and good convo! These folks will take care of you and be sure to find your fix. I always come here and am happy to spend my bucks on their products. Thank you guys!; Cheyenne was amazing!!

But within the last couple of months they have changed management and completely changed the inside. Yes they are adding glass and have lots of juices…. But they are also out of so many things.

There were some pods that looked like the ones I used but were labeled differently than what I’ve gotten in the past. I asked if they would work and she said “I don’t know” and shrugged her shoulders. I left with nothing because I was afraid the pod wouldn’t work in my vape. They say they are revamping it. If they are, then they need to close down, get all their stuff in stock that they are going to carry, actually train their new employees properly since they let go of the old employees that actually new the products they were selling, and then open back up. I use to love this shop, but since they changed management and let go of a bunch of employees… I have not had a great experience the last few times I’ve been in.; The staff is awesome!

Definitely recommend this place!; Clean, large selection, great prices compared to others(ex 2 geek bar pulse x disposable at smoke shop near me cost $66, they charge 2 for $40); THE BEST VAPE SHOP EVER!!
They ALWAYS have the best price for juices (the juice we get is $15.99 here and EVERYWHERE else is at least $23 or more!!) They even started ordering extra of the juice we always get so they have plenty in stock for us every time we go! (We never have to worry about running out or not being able to find it! They always order extra just for us 😊) And all the staff know the different kinds of mods very well so they give great recommendations  (I absolutely love my new geek vape mod with the Zeus tank 💗)
Their rewards program is amazing too, every other time I go I'm able to use my points for additional discounts (like 30% or $10 off) on the already best priced juices 😁
And the best part is they stand by their products, if you unhappy with the mod you got or get a bad atomizer in a pack you can take it back in and they will work with you to replace the items, so you never have to worry about your purchases here!
My hubby and I ONLY go here and will continue to go here forever! (We have been going to this place since we moved to the Queen Creek area about 6 months ago.)
Highly recommend!!
Would give a million stars if I could 🌟; I love this place. The selection is amazing, the Legos are inspiring and the staff is super helpful and friendly. I go out of my way to hit The Vape Lab."

Prices weren’t the highest but they weren’t the best, my biggest complaint is the guy working seemed annoyed that I was in there. For example even though the disposable vapes are back 15 feet behind the counter to where it’s impossible to read what flavors they have, dude made zero effort to tell me what flavors they had or give any type of opinion or suggestions. Overall the customer service was straight garbage. I don’t ask much, and I’m not a high maintenance customer, and you don’t have to act like working the counter at a vape store is your one true calling in life and any other job or career would be a waste of your skill, ambition, drive to achieve greatness and your one true desire; but damn my guy act like you you maybe would like some repeat customers. I know it’s not going to affect your bottom line or make a difference at all, so I’m not saying this like I think me never returning is going to run you out of business, but I definitely will not be returning and I won’t refer any one to this place.

Decent selection, only issue is they don't manage their stock well. The e-juice I always get is never in stock. That is the only reason I stopped shopping there. As soon as they correct that, I'll start going again.; Came here with my fiance to get her first vape. Heard that this store was good for newbies. However, we were rushed and were not guided through on how to do anything. He helped us hook up everything up, but I wish he had gone slow enough or directly showed us how to change the coil, add juice, or open it up for cleaning. Maybe a handout with the info would be helpful. We'll probably need to stop into another smoke/vape shop once the coil burns out to learn how to do that.; Plenty of juice, great selection actually! Good prices and awesome coupons if you subscribe with them. I just wish they had more hardware and rebuildable materials, then I would definitely throw 2 more stars up!; As someone new to vaping, I went in with my Cool Fire 4 and was looking for some advice and probably juice/accessories. Unfortunately the guy working there was either stoned, mentally challenged or completely apathetic.  As I was trying to pry any nugget of useful information from him, he lazily grunted barely understandable non-answers. Very quickly I realized the place was not for me or anyone else new to the vaping game. It's too bad because its a cool little shop. I'll continue my search for good customer service elsewhere.; It's worth driving the 20mile round trip from Ahwatukee for me! I've tried many many shops and had mostly bad experiences with a lot of the other shops here in Chandler, poor customer service (as someone who works in customer service myself I understand and appreciate it very much and it's my main deciding factor when it comes to deciding who gets my business), many local places have a terrible selection of juices and sell only sketchy basic liquids for insane prices, and many local shops don't even know much about vaping and setups. I've had NONE of these problems with VC Chandler!! They're always friendly & helpful, they have HUGE variety of juices of all kinds, they have every juice available to sample at the bar (on nice tanks too so you can get a feel for it before buying). A great selection of devices to choose from, starter kits to custom mods, RDAs, RTAs, tanks, atomizers, and accessories.I also appreciate them using 5 Star Rewards system to accumulate reward points to use for free gear. Part of why I love this shop is because they have a discount juice-bucket always stocked with a decent assortment of random juices, sizes, and strengths (30ml are $10 or 2 for $18, and 15ml are only $6 for 1bottle $10 for 2 & $13 for 3!!) so if money is a bit tight you'll still be able to vape happily without sacrificing quality!! Vape Central is the 6th shop I've visited in Chandler and it's definitely the only one for me now. Very nice upscale interior with leather couches, great product presentation, and a very nice bar to use while sampling flavors!! Hands down the BEST shop around!!"

Unfortunately, since it was their first time attending this place, they indicated that due to the poor treatment they would not return. Upon entering, the lady found herself with a hostile attitude. She indicated that they could not assist her, because she did not bring her printed documentation. However, I emphasize that in other dispensaries I have never had any type of inconvenience due to this. The license is currently up to date. The annoyance is the way this budtender treated her. Likewise, she treated another patient who was on par with her in the same way. It should be noted that the people who attend these places are PATIENTS, and deserve the same respect as everyone. when receiving help in in-hospital facilities. It is unfortunate that at this point we continue to encounter people who are not fit to work with a public that suffers from various conditions and is only seeking treatment.

I want to highlight that they told him to stop by the premises again later. The question is, what would it change? Why didn't they guide these patients as they deserved?

We are talking about a medicinal resource, not a 'clandestine' place

I hope you can guide your staff better. I'm sure that's not the first impression they wanted to give. Excellent day.; Bad experience on the phone call, it seems that the girl did not have patience and hung up the call.; I love the service I go from Hatillo because from day one they answered all my questions and gave me phenomenal guidance from the staff with a lot of love and attention and with a variety of products.

Nothing typical, everything studied to the millimeter to obtain the best flowers of the moment.

I was placing an order today and when I got to the shipping section it said that I had to pick it up. There wasn't an option to have it shipped accept for commercial shipping. Which obviously isn't going to work. After finding the address and their hours of operation I decided I'd try calling to see if I placed my order today would I be able to pick it up before they closed or would I have to wait til Monday because their closed on the weekend. I regrettably didn't get the guys name so I talked to but he said to go ahead and head on over and that he'd wait for me to get there. The drive only took about 20 minutes which wasnt bad at all. The building is just your average non descript warehouse. At first I went around back but soon realized my error and drove back around front. I parked right out front and went inside. I was met by a couple gentlemen whom greeted me politely. It was incredibly clean inside the office. I told the guy my name and just as I did a lady comes walking into the office from the warehouse holding a small box. It was my order. After getting a copy of my driver's license I asked a couple of which questions and was very satisfied with the answers I received. I'm now sitting in my car parked outside their business writing this. I, of course, opened my box to ensure everything was correct and of course it was. Everything was wrapped up and packaged very carefully and neatly!

If you've read this far my point from all of this is that this place is freakin awesome! He could have told me I'd have to wait to pick my order up on Monday but he didn't. My order was less than $25 so no big deal. But they made me feel like my patronage was important. Thats missing from alot of companies these days. So if your looking for salt nic or regular e juice this is the place to go. I also want to mention that they were the only supplier I could find that sold unflavored nic salt juice in standard consumer sizes. LNW has a customer for life!; EDIT: Since I left the review they reached out to me numerous times and explained the issue. When they updated their website /changed servers none of the recipes migrated over. They have since fixed it, all of my recipes (and I hope others) have returned. They were slow to respond initially but once they realized what was going on they definitely made it right and apologized profusely.

My initial review:
""DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE!!!! They delete any negative reviews on their webpage. I have been using this website for five years to create and store ejuice recipes. They just DELETED ALL of the recipes without warning. Their response when I created a ticket was ""Sorry for the inconvenience, it doesn't look like there is a way to retrieve your recipes. Have a good day!"" They obviously do NOT care about their customers. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for products and to store your recipes.""; I had order from here twice the first time they where super fast order on Friday morning and got my package on Monday. I was a kinda put off that shipping was around 14 bucks but I wasn't to worried since it was fast. The second time was not the case. I order the same time then the first package Friday morning. I didn't get a response tell Monday Night and now the package is going take a week to get here. I also decided to place an order with another company on Sunday and shipping was only 4 dollars. There package left sooner then this one and will be to me sooner. I am kinda bummed cause I was really starting to like this place but now I won't shop here anymore.; I have been working with this supplier for 7 months now and they continue to impress me. Always very helpful and knowledgeable on the phone. There is no process time! My order is sent out the same day I order! Order shows up clean and clear with a certificate of analysis on every order. Outstanding company if you manufacture your own E-juice!; A sorry company to deal with. Will not send you a full order but have no problem with sending you a partial while charging you an outrageous shipping charge. Does not offer their customers a choice on whether or not you want a partial shipment or not. Just bad business. I'll never use them or recommended then again. Search the net. There are plenty of other retailers around the same prices as LNW. Some a little higher, some a little lower. Now how can they claim to be ""Wholesalers"" when other ""Retailers"" are the same price? Crooks and liers in my opinion. Just beware if you choose to do business with these people."

They make sure the product you get is quality and not only that, if you're a consistent customer they'll check on how you’re doing.
This shop is great! .; Management has to get pricing inline with reality and competition. 10% higher than their immediate competitors for the item I was looking for, 20% higher than the manufacturers price.

If you are selling for a higher price than the manufacturer, you’re doing it wrong. With the hundreds of shops in the valley, there is no point going to one that is ripping off its customers.

I was able to go elsewhere and find what I need for the proper price. Magic lost out on hundreds of dollars from my purchase that their competitor who price matched got.; Liz and Amanda were so friendly and helpful!! Wonderful employees who knew their stuff. Immediately felt welcomed and beyond satisfied with our purchase. Very large selection and clean shop. Thanks again ladies, from the NC travelers!"

I take Kratom for back pain and nootropic benefits and this store always carries a wide selection of powders, capsules, and concentrates and they always keep their stock up to date, and if a product is being promoted you often get a deal on the price.

All their vaping products are always stocked well and varied.

If you need anything specific just ask, they're always willing to give out of their way to carry a product or flavor or whatever you need, especially for loyal customers they will always go above and beyond.

Angie is the Sweetest most professional, polite, and helpful woman ever, and she is always on top of whatever you need.

Frederick is an Amazing guy. Always had the best sense of honor, and will genuinely look after you and take the time to get exactly what you're stopping in for, noatter how far he has to dig, or research, he will even call the owner or off duty employees and if he can't get you an answer or solution right then, he will take down your info and honestly follow through and do it what it takes to earn your business.

Vape shops are a dime a dozen, but quality, honest, and helpful small businesses like this one, that are staffed by genuinely helpful, kind, and wonderful people are much rarer to find, so look no further than ValeLand.

Couldn't say enough good about this store and the people there.

Also, almost forgot. They have an awesome loyalty rewards system, of youre a salt nic user you'll earn free pods or coils, and if you use disposables you'll get a percentage off when you buy two or more. Just another way they give back to their customers.; I love this place! Specially being the only store in this part of the valley selling the only menthol juice I love! Awesome staff and never ending variety of products!; Very helpful staff and good selection. When my device broke and I was out of state the owner mailed one to me! She has done this for me twice!

And highly recommend this shop. A+ customer service!; Absolutely adore patty, unfortunately the owner upsells bad flavors he can’t sell if you ask what he recommends. Got burned three times with bad vape flavors, hoping to make it when patty’s working. Bummer owners driving away good business since it’s the only conveniently located smoke shop. A tip for the owner: recommendations are generally based off of what IS selling, not what isn’t.; Uncle John was the cashier working when I stepped into this vape store next to our hotel in Scottsdale. He was awesome. Very informative - and I had lots of questions. The place is decent size, very clean, and well-organized. He took the time to give me a long explanation of tobacco salt, which I really appreciated.

I bought a couple Vuse refills and was back on my way - good prices (much better than the Bay Area) and great service!; Patty was very knowledgeable and sweet. I had a great experience buying my coil and the variety of flavors is awesome. The store was clean and they even had candy for my kids. I will definitely be coming back for any vape products I may need. Thank you Patty.; If u need a very wide assortment of vape flavors they actually have a menu on their wall in digital display and the woman working behind the counter is the sweetest woman ever went in there with a set amount of money and came out with a super tank turbo and two new flavors for $50"

Coming from CALIFORNIA MUCH ❤️💨; This store exhibits questionable business practices that may lead to customer dissatisfaction and potential overcharging. During my initial visit, I was enticed by a seemingly generous offer from a salesperson (Geo) who appeared attentive and helpful, promising a 15% discount on merchandise. I selected an item priced at $49.99, but upon giving it as a gift, discovered a significant and unattractive imperfection on it, resembling damage or melting.

When I attempted to return the flawed item, I was informed that the store has a strict no-refund policy, only allowing exchanges for items of equal or greater value, with the latter requiring an additional payment despite earlier promises of discounts. Specifically, I was offered a 25% discount on a more expensive item as part of this exchange, yet upon completing the transaction, I found that no discount had been applied, resulting in me paying the full price for the replacement.

This experience highlights a lack of transparency and fairness in the store's pricing and return policies. The discrepancy between the promised discount and the actual billing, coupled with the no-refund policy applied even in cases of defective merchandise, suggests a business model that may prioritize profit over customer satisfaction and trust.

Furthermore, the discovery of a similar product at a significantly lower price elsewhere underscores the potential for overpricing at this establishment. This incident suggests that consumers should approach transactions with this business cautiously, armed with the understanding that the advertised offers and policies may not be as beneficial to the customer as they appear. It is advisable for shoppers to seek alternative venues where pricing is transparent, customer policies are fair, and the integrity of the merchandise is guaranteed, to ensure a more satisfactory and trustworthy shopping experience. I personally will not be shopping here ever again.; Great place. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. Great prices; By far the coolest smoke shop on this side of town! Used to have to always drive way into to Phx to get stuff I needed/wanted.
Finally there’s a place right down the street with it all!
Good prices and dude working there was cool and patient with my unknowledgable self 😂

Will for now on be my go-to.

Amazing how many different things they have in there!
Highly recommended!; GREAT cigar selection
Shop is just  adjacent to Circle K(Diet Dew+Code Red fabulous choice)

I ordered 4 bottles of peach pear on 01/08/23. Didn't get it I til 01/19/23 from some obscure delivery service. Although it showed up. it was the wrong stuff. When I called to ask what happened the guy's phone was in and out. Couldn't understand him. Be careful ordering from them.  I asked for a refund and am returning the items. Let's see how long it takes to get the refund, stay tuned.🤦🏻‍♀️; 1 star due to the fact that they didn't have my order ready when they sent an email saying it was. They also didn't have the items I ordered so I had to make a compromise and get whatever else they had. Customer service wasn't the best, I had mentioned when someone orders something they expect to get what they order. The man behind the counter simply told me the person picking the order wasn't all there in the head. That didn't really make anything better, in fact it made things seem more unprofessional. So I don't need to spend money here again and wanted to warn others to think twice if they are thinking about going to this shop. You might get the same treatment. Also when I got home I noticed one of the bottles was past the expiration date with a broken seal. I should have checked harder but just wanted to get my stuff and go. That's not right no matter how you put it.; I put in an online order last Thursday for some juice which normally retails in the $30 range which they had for $5. My package shipped within what I would consider a reasonable time for a smaller outfit (Tues/Wed). I received everything in good order Saturday, with a hand written apology for the delay in shipping and an extra tube of juice gratis.

I'll definitely order from them again in the future.; What a place to shop at, and they carry CHLZ Nicotine Pouches 🔥🔥 A must see; City of Vape has been excellent. When I couldn't get any company online to send e-juice to Michigan because of our ban, they helped me get American Made Solace Bold Tobacco which was allowed by law. Since the ban was released, they helped with an order of Solace Creamy Tobacco my favorite and sent me 3 extra Solace e-juices for free. Great customer service."

I was there for about 5-6 minutes before an employee came and asked me if I needed anything. Mind you there were no other customers in the shop at this time.

30ml is $7.99. 60ml is $13.99. 120ml is $18.99.
You can pick between glass or plastic when you order the 60 or 120ml bottles.
I wish there was a way to give them more than 5 stars. The customer service is beyond amazing. You can sample any flavor before you buy it. The last “name brand” juice I bought was $28.00 for 60mils. Here I bought 2 30mil bottles for a grand total of $15.00 due to Veterans Day sale and I couldn’t be happier. Nearly half the cost and double the taste. There’s a wide selection of flavors he can mix for you or you can ask him to mix a couple to make your own. All of the juices are aged for two weeks before he even puts them out on the shelf so you don’t have to worry about any weird flavors. He can add any amount of nicotine you want. If you’re not happy with how the flavor came out and have at least 3/4 of the bottle left then you can take it in and he’ll add whatever flavor it’s lacking. The mods and starter kits are closer to online prices than any other place I’ve been to. The list of good things goes on and on. If you’re tired of every boring vape shop that’s filled with the same people and overpriced products and want something different then this is the place for you.; Best shop in Chandler. Amazing customer service and prices and Can’t be be beat in quality.  Robert was amazing. 10/10 recommend.; I went in the shop about a week ago to purchase a new vape and the gentleman that was helping me was very short with me and was not knowledgeable on what he was selling. He was a heavier guy with a beard and glasses looked to be late 20s/ early 30s. After asking him about 3 questions he started being rude and short tempered. After getting my device he sat down and someone else had to come help me pick out my juice and coils, It was not a good experience and I will not be coming back.; Really friendly and knowledgeable staff.

Great store good prices and awesome customer service; Bought a Geek Bar Vape, and told the employee if I can test it in store as I’ve had a few out of the many that I’ve bought elsewhere, be defective and stay on when not using. All other shops kindly take it back and swap it out for a proper working one. The employee here said “yes, we make sure everything works properly.”

First vape pull and the device stayed on. I told them that it is not supposed to continue to stay on after you finished taking a pull.

They said the device was not defective and that it is supposed to work like that.

A vape should not continue firing when there is no air draw. The 3 employees that helped out and saw the issue do not know anything about vapes and how they work and refused to exchange it.

Now, I have a vape that is staying on, burning the coil and draining my battery long after taking a hit/pull. I can’t even turn it off because it stays on, or when I turn it on, it sometimes starts firing without taking a pull.

Will not come back or recommend anyone here.; Went there a couple of hours ago and the service was very very bad. We were attended by the most unwelcoming employee i’ve ever met. He made no effort in finding a product for us. Definitely not returning there.; Bought a 5000 puff vape. Lasted 1 week. Called the manufacturer and they told me to call the store to change it. Called store and they wouldn’t do a thing. $44 for NOTHING. Don’t buy from them; I went there to leave a resume and the retail associate trashed my resume. She was so obvious, i told her to call the manager,  she had a conversation on the phone that lasted for seconds. Then, I insisted to call him again but this time to test her.

The product (in terms of the disposable 2000 puff vapes) that I used was awful. The battery life dies before you run out of juice leaving me with like a 1/4 of the cartridge left. I feel like I got ripped off because it happened with all 4 that I had purchased. For the price I paid for them, I would kind of expect the battery to outlive the juice. I would say I got unlucky but it happened 4 times. Don't forget about how much they get clogged too. Hope this helps someone in the future.; I brought my broken vape into the store 48hrs after switching from cigarettes. The gentleman that assisted me was so patient and kind. He wanted to troubleshoot the vape and figure out the problem before he sent me on my way with something that may or may not work. I was able to test his solution in the store and it worked perfectly! Prices were extremely affordable with a large selection of products. Still cigarette-free and was thankful for Traci’s Vapor Emporium all the way home. Having a store close to Fort Stockton is a definite lung saver!"

HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE!

Where has customer service gone ?  Not that I actually expect good customer service from a place run by teenagers. But I was told I had 30 days to return the product I purchased if  I had any issues with the product.  So, I am here 25 days later to return this device because I am not happy with the way it worked.  Courtney was the one I made contact with when I actually purchased the device and she happen to be their when I came to return it. She was great! It was another individual whom I could not see, only hear, that threw his/her defensive and non-knowledgeable opinion out to quickly deny my return.  He/she asked if it worked. Puzzled, I looked at Courtney who was helping me and I answered back to the unknown voice, that it still powered on, but it just did not work correctly, and I was unhappy with the product.  He/she was quick to reply back that the product has to be defective and not power-on for the store to take it back.
Confused and irritated I explained that that’s is not what I was told when I purchased the product. Otherwise, I would’ve not even wasted my time coming up there to exchange it.  Both employees looked at each other, as if trying to read each other‘s thoughts on the matter and how to proceed.
He/she had the brilliant idea to ask their boss.  Which was going to be my next idea as well except that when.he/she made the call, he/she walked out of earshot through the back of the store and appeared back outside the front door.  Making sure I heard nothing of their conversation.  I can’t even be sure a Manager or boss was even called. He/she walked through the front door with the answer of NO. That the store could not help me. I already knew the answer the second he/she walked through the back on the phone, clearly making sure that only its version of the story was told.
Ultimately, in the end, the store lost me as a customer and the potential sale of another device.  Because, even though I was being denied the exchange, I was still considering purchasing something else.
If I was treated better and was sincerely listened to by an actual person with decision making power, Vape City could have kept a customer and avoided this NEGATIVE REVIEW.; They don’t honor their customer rewards or agreements I spent a lot of money here and go out of my way just to shop here their five star rewards isn’t worth the space on my phone if they won’t honor it. I tired redeeming my points on the same product I purchased to accumulate my points.; Cedric and Santana were both very helpful with the products I was interested in.  I had an issue with a device and they were quick to fix the issue and have me on my way. The store stands behind their products and I could not be happier with the service. Prices are fair and the selection process s great.  I will tell my friends, and return many times.

Wanted to add an update. I have been there a couple times since then, and Ashley and Tatiana have upheld the excellent reputation of this store.  Thank you for the suggestions!; The Geek Bar vapes are $32 just for one which is absolutely ridiculous. If you want to be successful then offer products less than any competition or at least match the average price for a Geek Bar.; Best place in arlington to get your smoke products which is comparatively cheaper than any other store. Plus its open 24/7, which makes it more awesome. Also, they got some good people working there who provides the best customer service. Overall, great place, everything was so organized and clean & tidy. Would love to shop again in the future."

There was a lady and a gentleman with longer hair working. Upon walking in the gentleman seemed a bit upset by how he looked at my friends and I. We all got the vibe something stressful had just happened. The lady was busy with another customer, so it was up to the gentleman to help us out. I came in for an 18mm AC and to view the cool glass in the shop. Told him about that and asked a few questions. His answers to my questions were quick and simple which at first I was understanding of due to my belief that something serious had happened. I asked to view the 18mm ACs to which he showed me the case. He said the top row was all 18mm. Saw one I liked and asked him to grab it and confirm it was 18mm. He grabbed it quickly and handed it to me asking if I wanted anything else. Turns out he grabbed a 14mm one which I didn’t catch and ended up purchasing. What really disappointed me was while he was checking me out, the lady who had finished with her customer began profusely apologizing to him about a missed order. I had thought it was an important glass delivery, but as they kept talking it turned out to just be a food delivery order. Dude was that stressed about his lunch that he barely helped my friends and I while giving me the wrong product. Gotta chill out man you work in a glass shop.; Extremely friendly staff, which is super helpful because I get nervous entering smoke stores, especially alone!

They don’t know their products except for Tana she’s probably the only one there that knows how to run a smoke shop. They have poor selection, inconstant supply, lack of experience and half of these employees don’t know what they are selling. No wonder this is a slow shop, they offer nothing but rudeness and waste of time.

Enjoy Every visit. They have Great Products that they stand by & even better customer service!! 👍👍; I had one vape shop that I went to for 6 years. I went to Vape Girl for my first time 3 weeks ago. I HIGHLY recommend this vape shop!! Sometimes I can be a hard person to please. The customer service is great, and they go out of their way to make sure you have the best vaping experience possible!; I've been on vuse for two years and thought there was no way I'd find a juice that I liked for a mod. Vape Girl has been the only vape shop that has in house juice and others that you can actually taste the flavor and so far they're all amazing. I will be going here exclusively from now on. P. S. Menthol Key Lime tastes like a margarita!; Best Vape Shop around. Having tried so many other places over the years, I'm glad I finally found this place.

Store is very well laid out,well stocked,and incredibly clean. The young lady whom helped me is extremely knowledgable and nice, and they run lots of specials.
Told my daughter in law she needs to start going there for her vapes.; Place was amazing when they opened. The guy running it was on point with keeping stock up. Especially special orders. He new my name, knew where all his supply was and was super helpful.  Last 3 times ive been in he uasnt been there and they were either out of the coils i use or the juices the my wife and I like if not both. On top of that I have to show the staff where to find what I need.  I made this my go to place because of the customer service and stock. Since the guy has been gone its hard to get what I need and just doesnt have that same vibe.; Sent a friend to get a pack of cigarettes and the cashier did him wrong. He asked for the cheapest pack of menthol, mind you he has never bought cigarettes before, so the cashier gave him a pack that cost 10 dollars instead of actually giving him a cheap pack. In my book that is taking advantage of someone. Will never use this store again.; I really liked this store...it has some pretty neat stuff in it..plus they have a pile of vapes on sale for cheap...like $5.00-$8.00 vapes....and there cigarettes are cheaper than anywhere else... except for the other stores the same person owns. Which is one behind the Chevron on exit 6 of picayune..and they also own the Chevron on nicolson!  I can get 2 pks of Marlboro cigarettes for $9.00 for both PKS. Other places u pay $8.00-$9.00 a pk.  They are very friendly they treat u as friends not just as customers! There stores are always very very clean! I just all around love all there stores that this owner owns!!!!!; If we could give them a no-star rating we would, as it's more appropriate.  My fiance just purchased two disposable vapes from this location and one of them wasn't working right. Bubbling bad and shooting liquid into her mouth and the employee would not exchange it for one that worked properly. Will not be getting our business anymore, as we do not believe we should have to pay for something broken."

The first time I applied for the tourist permit took about 7 hours to get it done, 2nd time took 2-3 days. Resident medical cannabis took 3+ weeks. Your best situation is to ask for the phone number of the doctors they used so you can call them directly to check the status of the application.

If you have medical cannabis license from the states you can buy edibles or concentrates. If you don’t want to wait for the tourist visa and want to taste something like flowers buy some Kief or the Portobello kush vape."

Went in on a Wednesday with very little knowledge about vapes (to try to get off cigarettes). The store is very clean and bright and does not smell like all the other vapes stores (if you know what I mean).Very organized and professional store and employees. Not intimidating at all. The man and women (wish I got their names) were so friendly and knowledgeable.  They explained everything to me and got me all set up with my vape. I actually went back on Thursday for some fine tuning and they were so great again. I cant wait to go back knowing I will see friendly faces. Great job!!; amazing experience! I didn’t know anything walking into the store and a very helpful employee (I forgot to get their name) educated me on what i was buying and what would be best for me. I never write reviews but i’m so happy with my purchase and the amazing customer service I received. Will definitely be back!; Best vape shop in Ocean county. Everytime I go here, there is always a really good sale I can never pass up. Stop buying those garbage disposables and give this a try. The juices they have are so good and smooth unlike disposables like lava which have an overwhelming horrible taste.; Love your false advertising claiming "" Stop smoking and start vaping"" feel sorry for the nice patrons who believe that LINE! Vaping  has nicotine in it! And chemicals is most likely worse than cigarettes because of the synthetic scents! And  I do have a personal gripe with vape sales and deadly false advertising as I Iost my sweet  mother who started vaping at 75  she was a life long cig smoker but started vaping 5 years ago and suffered a hemorrhagic stroke and a slow brain bleed that left her paralyzed! It was the worst tragedy for our family. And seeing what vaping and cigarettes did to her was heart wrenching. She was more addicted to her vape and  never put it away unlike her cigarette pack. Terrible that you put out this  false narrative that vaping isn't smoking because It definitely is! Sadly no body care$ though unless it's there parent lying in the coffin.; This store provides a wide section of vaping hardware and Geekvape Sonder Q is my favourite!"

I bought a Best Buds live resin cart yesterday, and let me tell you that's gonna be my cart of choice in the future.

My only caveat is to CHECK the packages that have no window or no feeling if there is a cart inside; right inside the store after purchase to avoid any awkward situations.

Will come back later after two months.; Called for service over the phone and was greeted by a man named ALFREDO. Took him a minute to juggle the phone around and finally figure out how to use it and finally says hello while coughing and chilocking on go knows what. He was very rude to say the least, kept calling me gentlemen with a sarcastic undertone over and over even after i asked him to stop calling me that. I was simply asking to speak with a supervisor which he also denied me that right. After asking for his last name so I could make a formal complaint he also denied me that right.

Bwell has some of the worst customer service i have ever experienced. Complete lack of respect and disregard for proper etiquette when it comes to dealing with people. I was simply calling to correct information that was not properly entered. After giving me the incorrect information he proceeded to transfer me to the dispensary, and then hung up on me. After I called back he said he could no longer transfer me and hung up without saying goodbye or giving me the chance to say anything else. If you have the luck of speaking with ALFREDO just do yourself the favor and hang up. Its a guarenteed dead end.; I truly do not understand what is wrong with the employees at this location. I would honestly put down A large bet and say that these employees have not received any time of formal customer service/ sensitivity training, what so ever. It feels like I’m talking to actual drug dealers that are SO UNBELIEVABLY UNHELPFUL AND RUDE.; Not a good experiance with  employees,except for recepcion.Inside workers were not nice answering questions everyone was in like a bad mood.We felt like what we were going to buy was free. Prices high.; My first dispensary.  Very welcoming and attentive staff. Prices are not the best, but there's attention to detail and service."
