If I absolutely have to stop there then I will, but one morning I stopped there for coffee and that lady got upset because I didn’t want a cup coffee. I poured it down the drain to get the other one and she raised her voice, “said why did you go and that ?” I was like uh because I want the other coffee. “ now you have to pay for two cups!” She went to the mangers office and I waited in line and I left. Came back to pay later. Service sucks!; What was good about this station was even though it looks small they have 16 pumps that are located in different parts of the lot that allows easy access for most rigs. Be aware that pumps 12 through 16 are cash only as the card readers on these pumps do not work.; I went there this morning to purchase a food item, and they would not honor the price tagged.  I refused to purchase it and inform the clerk forger it and left. He still charged me for items without not receipt or product received.  He said he tried to catch me, I'm over 40 yo and I saw no attempts of him stopping me... Called him he tells me I have to talk to the manager and further advises me idk when the manager will be in?!?! Very poor customer service; Sometimes service is good but most times service is bad because I barely gave a ripped $20 to the clerk and he said he couldn't take torn bills and it wasn't even ripped or torn in half barely a cm but I guess it's still torn to him but money is still money and it wasn't coming out of his pockets unless it's him that is the owner of the store; the tall male cashier is so good and welcoming. he deserves to be praised for welcoming people and being happy always. place is clean."

I pulled in here to fill up my semi, and did so. But the whole time I had to listen to wretched Millennial music. Nothing but pointless, tuneless, breathy, meandering, whiny garbage. I'd rather listen to a dentist drill! In my own mouth than listen to this garbage. The last One 9 played classic rock or something similar, from the Golden Age of Music. It doesn't cost one cent more, and is timeless! Rather than meandering and tuneless.; First and last time I’ll stop in here. Ordered 4 chicken strips. Gal told me it would be cheaper to order 5. So I said ok. That plus a sweet tea from the cooler and my total was $14.94  that’s beyond absurd.; 08:20pm went in to grab something hot to eat. Poor selection of available hot sandwiches. Soup bar was pretty much non-existing. All 3 soup pots were empty. Only thing readily available was pizza or cold foods. Settled for a turkey wrap. Also the hallway leading to the restrooms and showers was freshly mopped. Wet floor sign was out but it looked as though no attempt was made to clean up the excess water on the floors. Looked more like someone took a 5 gallon bucket of water and dumped it in the hallway.; Update:This is not the first time we have stopped here, BUT we leave because there is LOUD MUSIC WHICH INTERFERES WITH RELAXING!!!
Update:You understand that the driver needs to get some rest, but you don't want to turn down the music for the night!  There's a queue for the shower!

The floors were dirty when i walked in (about 3am). Shower #1 was like a sauna inside.   When I walked in, the heat hit me in the face. It was 80 degrees outside, and it felt cooler than this shower room.  It is sad you have to spend $18 on a dirty and hot shower room. I wouldn’t stop here if it were the last place on earth. Keep going down the road to the TA. It is actually much cleaner.; For having been renovated recently this location is still trash. The inside is still crowded and looks dusty and dirty. The showers have no ventilation or refrigerated air,  so you leave your shower all sweaty. The new wood grain tile recently installed is all black with a orange color mildew. The only positive part is the parking expansion unfortunately they didn't increase the number of showers.  You where better of building a new facility instead of trying to fix the current one.; Went over the road for a vacay. Missed the otr experience. Stopped here for a shower. Shower #2,was not exactly gleaming. Hey, the shower was hot.; The store itself is alright. Regular Love’s with decent restrooms and plenty of truck parking, sometimes you can find a few spots during the night (you can always go to the Petro if you are in a hurry for parking).

Verizon internet signal is not very good on the back spots.

The reason I give them 2 starts only is because during my visit today (10/02 at 1200) there were a CDL attorney insurance salespeople that were extremely annoying. The girl was asking for my ID, and when I told her i had it in the truck, she said she could follow me on the way out lol. I don’t know if Love’s itself is starting to do this, but this is such an uncomfortable experience and you can’t tell me the managers weren’t aware of this harassment.; Lots of parking, didn't bother going inside..."

And most of the employees are friendly. I have only come across 2 that weren't pleasant. And their subs are so much better than subway could ever think of being. And try their grilled BLT with ham! I look for QT's to stop at. I hate circle K!; TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE  Three weeks ago , on a Monday, I get $60 gas and attempted to clean my windshield.  Water in container was nasty, smelly and had no soap. Spoke to manager.  His response was ""the weekend crew is kinda lazy""  and would you like me to clean your windshield.  NO, but can you try to remedy this problem.  Spoke to Chis in corporate office. He apologized and agreed to send me a $10 coupon so that  I will revisit the store again and advised he would speak to the proper people to correct this problem.  This Monday I spent $55 for gas and had the same problem.  Dirty, smelling water to clean my windshield.  Spoke to Ivan, a store manager who asked if he could clean my windshield.  NO again but fix your problem. Called corporate again.  They have not returned my phone call. Bottom line. If your EXPECTATION IS, to fill your gas tank and then have nasty water to clean your windshield, you will be happy.  Otherwise you will have the same disappointment I have had. Oh, did a mention I had a TERRIBLE experience at this QT on Florence Blvd.

Edit:  STILL waiting  for the call from corporate headquarters.; Went in for a few items on my long trip to tucson.  We always stop there to get gas and munchies.  We were grabbing a cpuple things and I decided to grab a couple lottery tickets, they have a machine but i couldn't get it working so went to the counter, Gabriel (his tag said he was an assistant manager) was so rude.  I asked if he knew if the lottery machine wasn't working abd he gave me a crappy look and shrugged his shoulders.  I said "" well I couldn't get it so can I get 2 powerballs"" he shot me a hateful look and turned around to get them but kinda placed his head so he could give me crappy looks some more and punched the buttons then slammed the cards down.  I guess punching 3 buttons is a chore for him.  I muttered  ""friendly"" and he walked over to help the next people.  Sorry Gabriel that you had to punch 2 buttons but you need to work on your customer service skills.  Rude; Great QT store, location is very nice with an abundance of parking and the usual friendly employees; Great store and great gas station. The store is large and very clean. They have tons of snacks, hot food items and beverages.
This is a great place to stop and get snacks and drinks before a road trip."

Also, employee actually used safety food gloves properly which was so awesome! She properly removed and replaced them with a new pair after every order was completed. Just like it is supposed to be done! Store is old, but it was very clean and service was great.; 1st time stopping here! Times are stuff! You blessed me with having /allowing a local church congregation(Compass Church,  Casa Grande, Az )to give out free 6inch subway subs, chips, and drink , 1 Bible, free, free, free,  I even ask them to pray with me openly and something I do not normally do.

I have been getting beat down by low rates the last 3 months battling for every cent. Please continue PRAYING for all the truckers that went to Washington DC May 1st- May 7th. Drawing attention to the need for steady rates and steady freight, STOP CHEAP RATES!  Like I shared this Small act of kindness gave me hope to fight another day. Currently under a Uber Freight load, 2303 loaded miles at $1.09 per mile, going broke pulling this cheap rate. Normal economics is at least 2 times the cost.  The cost is what you see here $1.09 per mile. Thanks for letting me serve and share this information and you are allowed to share it as well. WITHOUT TRUCKS AMERICA STOPS ROLLING!  I know we each play our part and I am thankful in fighting the good fight another day! GOD BLESS YOU ALL!; As a local, I can tell you they have the lowest gas prices in the area. If you ever want to deal with a Manager, Cruz Molina is top notch. He and his crew provide the most friendly customer service and the place feels clean. What more can you ask for?; Cruz was such an amazing help!!! i have never had better customer service. His trainee named Tony is already exceeding expectations. He obviously has an amazing trainer. Good job guys and thank you!; Be careful ya'll you'll only put 32 bucks worth of gas, and they'll put a 126 dollar hold on your card.  I hope it goes back onto my account soon."

It is minutes away from my RV site. This is a local family owned establishment. The workers at this establishment are always ready to help.

Gas Station – Gas pumps work even if stores closed. There are not any EV chargers available.

Laundromat – It is located at the rear of the market. All machines operate only with quarters. You may ask the cashier to swap cash for quarters. Inside there is a ATM. The washing machines are three front loaders and work well. The sizes are as follows 60 lb.- $7.50, 40 lb. -$6, 22.5 lbs-$3.45. The two top loader machines are both 10 lb. -$1.50. The drying machines operate well. Though each quarter you put in the drying machine adds eight minutes. If you would like to partake in any smoking, feel free to use the 3 chairs outside.

Propane Area- The propane area is decorated with little yellow minions. They also have an attendant that runs Monday through Friday 9AM till 5 PM. To the front of the propane tank are many vacuum machines. So if you would like vacuum your dirty RV/ Rig/ automobiles.

Water machine- I fill up my 5 gallon water jug here because the water is sweet and not salty like the Walmart in Goodyear, AZ. Also, the water machine is outside the building. Anyone is able to refill water at any time.

Grocery store- First, I was happy to see they had a restroom for paying patrons. Well there are many different varieties of ice cream here. I was surprised the fresh scoop bluebell ice cream here was delicious. The Mexican Ice-cream on a stick was perfect as well. There are tubs Talenti, Häagen-Dazs, bluebell, blue bunny, bomb pop, and more. The were many fresh produces, dairy, bread, liquor, wine, beer, and a limited butcher shop. The only place in town with fresh meat let me add.

Please check out my photos!; Great local market with a small selection of fresh produce and meat. Hard to find produce elsewhere outside weekly farmer's market.  Staff is great. Pricing systems  have some errors compared to posted prices, so check your receipts. They take requests for special items for regular customers, so it's worth the occasional overcharge.; The laundry is filthy. Machines do not work and are not marked as out of order. None of these washers have been wiped. Dirt and debris in the tubs and the dispensers are gross.; I was surprised to see what this little market had to offer. They carried just about everything you would need so you wouldn't have to go to the big city. It was clean had a place to even get an ice cream cone.  Plenty of adult beverages and more.  Stop in and see for yourself. I was supposed and know you will be too.  I highly recommend this store. Plus in the back they have a little laundry mat.  Nice washers and dryers.; Most of the time good place to do business. The young lady with tattoos is not much of a people person. One of there help might beat you out of money. You just really have to watch yourself at times. I gave the 4 🌟 rating because overall it is a good place to shop."

I asked them why I’m waiting they said showers are not clean and no body there to clean them. I mean is this a joke.; The most useless truck stop in the country.  Cashless for a truck stop off I-10 is like having a stapler that can only staple one sheet of paper.  I will never support a cashless business.   Everything we do does not need to be tracked.   If I want to buy a bottle of water I should not need to make a card transaction for $2.   If I see any other Pilots going this direction I will simply remove them from my stops.; Bad location for a shower, I’ve had this happen to me multiple times at this location. It’s horrible when you spend over 4k$ on fuel each month and can’t even get a shower.
Stores slow, sign says 4 people waiting for showers, in 30 minutes no one has left a shower,
I imagine every single shower is empty and needing to be cleaned from the previous night.
And to top it off, since it’s early, the store is slow.; Stupid, unprofessional people works here! As a professional driver, I have unlimited shower for this month, but cashier told that no shower because system shutdown. So what? You have a water, you have a keys, what a problem to open the door? Showers on Love's truckstops still working, another reason why pilot goes down; Great travel stop. The store is clean and has a lot of variety. Cinabon makes the store smell amazing."

I have been kicked off the property while trying to light a cigarette. The manager, a tall skinny shaven head lady, has been most rude and defamed my character. I do not loiter. I rest after walking in the heat. I have seen her outside more than inside managing. She has arbitrarily scanned items where I am sitting. Her staff always cleans the bathroom when I am in there. I saw a staff member peeking under the partition at another poor victim. I have spent over $20 in the last day. I've bought wifi and it SUCKS. The truckers harass with Jake brakes, low gears, and bright lights. It all stems from the merchant. I dream of saying you Loves and making you change your name. BTW, I a
m charged for every refill and for water as well. No water in over 100 degrees. Crime of moral turpitude. Quarantine this place until we find the cure of HATE, please before I start hating as well. God please give her a noisy neighbor for the rest of her life. Amen.
Note another guest loves to shine bright in my face as I stand on the other side of the road to write this. God give me serenity.; I am a Love’s lover: people I’m acquainted with make fun of me for that, especially my boss. I stop by love’s for all travel needs; they are usually fulfilled. I stopped by on May 31, 2023. Yes I got my fruit cups, but THE RESTROOMS WERE OUT OF ORDER— UNACCEPTABLE!!!! The sign did say it was a scheduled maintenance issue. The clean operational restrooms are major factors in my sky high expectations. With that maintenance issue, I would expect a Love’s to rent Porto-potties or something like that - NO THEY DIDN’T!!!!; If I could give it a negative star, I would!!  worst customer service out of all the loves I’ve been to! Employee was smoking out front and started walking in front of me(yes she saw me) to head back inside, never once held the door for just walked in to both doors, letting it close behind her, the other lady at least said welcome.

There was no hot food at all! Nothing on the rolling grills nothing only subway

I freaking HATE this location; Truck stop from Hell!!
We got there at 4pm needed 2 air bags.. first they never checked if they had in stock then they kept saying ""2. hours""  next day came they called 9 am if my driver was there and they said 2 hours. At 2 pm they still have not ordered air bags. Finely they find it at 4 am after 36 hours. They are worthless useless layers. Horrible people from mechanic to the tire people. I had to pay 1250 and waste 36hours.; I love Love’s! I was on a road trip and stopped here because they have a dog park with artificial grass. Dog park was a bit small but super clean! They have a picnic table and bench to sit down. They also had poop baggies to clean up."

There was a small section that wasn’t grass inside the dog park and they had poop baggies to pick up after the doggies.; GREAT STORE, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE,  CLEAN SHOWERS, UPDATED TO NOW A TACO BELL. THANK YOU. -~-SANTA; This used to be a favorite stop to fill up with snacks and gas before crossing into California. We stopped 5/24/24 but didn’t fill up since half the pumps were broken (seriously not exaggerating)! People were waiting on the working pumps so we went to the newly opened Terrible’s, which was an easy in and out.; The place is small but it does have around it's 8 showers very convenient parking lots open spots but not completely big, it does work it's comfortable that has a ""Cat scale"".  Around 8 pumps diesel and also has gas for cars. You can get some coffee & hot dogs. This is one definitely good place to come here and rest full day because it does have a Subway, McDonald's and also a Burger King nearby so I do recommend it even though it is small.; The reservation parking area is not very well laid out,  it is very difficult to maneuver into those parking spots even for an experienced driver.  I wish these types of places that serve semi trucks keep this big rigs and their maneuverations in mind when they are sketching out the layout plan.  Trucks drivers already go through enough just to drive or pick up loads from some piss poorly designed locations,  and for the one moment where they have to come and rest,  they continue to stay stressed all the way till they park and go off duty.  Why?  Why can't at least their designated safe havens be just that,  easy in,  easy out? That's my only complaint."

The customer service rep is still away for several more minutes.
The store looks like a third world country store with no tile, just ugly concrete and their supply of foods is very limited and they lack several food items that other fry's has.
The neighborhood that this fry's is in should be bigger, much nicer and more varieties as well as better customer service but this location lacks all of that.; Wow, very rude!

It was 3 items, I can bring in what I bought, recreate the order, was trying to find any solution and the person literally didn't give one care. I've been shopping at Fry's my whole life and always have a positive experience with customer service. I've had some odd requests in the past I wasn't sure they would even attempt to make right and they always come thru. I'm honestly shocked at how I was just treated. And over a $10 over payment I just wanted to see if I could recoup.; This review is for the Fry's at Guadalupe and McClintock.  If I could give a 0 star rating, I would.  Purchased $200 in various gift cards on Friday to earn the extra fuel points.  Gave the Panera card to my wife to use on Saturday for lunch ($25).  Panera told her it was inactive (mind you, the Panera and Fry's are in the same plaza almost next to one another).  Went to the Fry's that afternoon to speak with CS and get a new card or proper activation (have my receipt and activation print out showing all cards activated).  Was told they couldn't do anything but was given multiple numbers to call.  Called all today and spent a good 20 min on the phone each with three different departments (all third party, non-native speakers of English, and not Kroger employees).  No resolution other than to send picture in of everything and wait 7-10 business days for PANERA to decide whether to reimburse or refund, NOT Kroger/Fry's, who sold the gift card to me.  And we were told Panera could deny it all and then just be out the $25.  This will officially be the LAST purchase I EVER make at a Fry's or ANY Kroger owned establishment, as it seems they have no willingness or ability to stand behind what they sell, but would rather defer to the vendor who's card they sold me.  That is like buying 5 lbs of bad ground beef from them and then telling me I have to take it up with the rancher who raised the cow, or the packing plant.  Beyond insane.  And the AI voice garbage you have to wade through to speak with someone in another country is nuts.  Enough already.  Why can't you have helpful, local or regional human beings to meet your customers needs??!  Profit hungry ridiculousness.  Done with them.; Really tired of coming here, people are rude and they never have what I'm looking for. Today apparently they don't have any hand baskets to do your shopping. I ask one of the cashiers and they snapback at me, "" we don't have any baskets!"" So some days they have baskets some days they don't, it's like some days they decide to have shopping carts, some days they don't. Regardless, this being a smaller store and not having everything I need, I have to go up the street to finish my shopping. Unfortunately I think this will be the last time I come here for awhile; The workers are extremely rude here. He lied to my face and gave me attitude. Genuinely the worst experience i’ve ever had at a frys."

This store was beautiful! Very clean! Organized and sanitized clean restrooms. Fresh fruit and lots of different coffee options.

Huge thank you to Jackie & Beth for helping with with price checks and helping me to wake up by showing me the expresso shots!

Awesome ladies! Sweet and friendly with beautiful smiles;-); This gas station and rest stop is actually pretty convenient. I was impressed with the cleanliness of this location. When I walked in, I was greeted with a smell of fresh food. The restroom facilities are clean and there were people actively attending to those in need in the bathroom. You never see that anywhere. They have snack, drinks, coffee, candy, chips, hot dogs, and anything you might want to eat on the road. They have a whole section for electronics, phone cables, gps stuff, etc… it’s easy to snag a novelty item if you need one. This station also has a lot of gas pumps and diesel, so there little chance of waiting. I would stop here again!; The restrooms were super clean and a very nice establishment overall. Great rest stop easy access to fuel pumps and separate RV parking. Pretty sweet deals on snacks and drinks too and a Taco John’s inside!; Gas prices 53 cents higher than advertised on Google. This is not the first time I've waited this long to fill up only to be tricked. Shell is accurate in their pricing. They claim to not be in charge of providing accurate gas prices for consumers.; First time I have stopped here. Will not be the last. Great place. Very clean. Fantastic Bathrooms. Love the items you can buy. Friendly staff. Plenty gas pumps.  They even have spaces to spend the night or longer for RV’s. Hot Showers and more. Even has a Taco John’s fast food place.

He was so visibly upset that I asked him if he was upset by helping me and he shook his head yes. To confirm I asked again are you really annoyed by assisting me and he said yes. I could not believe that he was talking to me this way when this what he gets paid to do, so I canceled the transaction and said I would take my money elsewhere where they aren't annoyed to help their customers purchase items. I would stop in every week and a half or so during my travels fill up gas and be in and out of there within about 3 to 4 minutes. I didn't ask questions I minded my own business just wanted to pay for my items and leave. I could not believe that he was this upset by the fact that he had to do his job which is what he gets paid to do. He had not been the nicest in the past before but this is the rudest he's ever been. I doubt that the owners will do anything this is really just to let other people know that are considering going here this is the type of treatment you'll get if you go during the ​night shift and there is the man with a long black hair; Super convenient because it's right off the freeway but not convenient enough to pay an extra $1.50 per gallon for diesel.  At the time of this review It's currently $6.09 per gallon at the Shell station or it's $4.55 per gallon at the Chevron on the opposite side of I-17."

When she told him that she didn't leave her credit card anywhere else, she replied (in front of the customers in line) that she now understands why they sent her to fix that, it's because the customers want to take charge at the gas station.
The young people who have treated me so far are helpful, loving and very polite.  Very far from today's experience with “the manager with 30 years of experience”!!!!

How hard is it to cover the portapotty vent pipes with stainless steel screens to keep the bugs out?!

Also the owner allows his strange, black dog to walk around property off leash.  The dog bothers customers, blocks the front door, and gets in the way of vehicles coming and going.; Last weekend we made a visit to Vegas from LA for my mother's 82nd birthday party. We couldn't have planned for the overturned truck that was on fire for 2 days turning our 4-hour drive into 12. Or the construction on the 40 merging 2 already cram packed lanes into 1.
Because of this thousands of people were stuck peeing on the side of the road, running out of water, and out of gas. I'm so disappointed that this place, with all of this going on, would charge that much for a gallon of gas. There was a woman  in front of me with her very expensive gas can begging people to let her in to buy 1 gallon. She had run out of gas by the freeway exit, and no one wanted to let her in! It was a 45-minute wait to get to the pumps in a running car and her children were in one out of fuel and without air conditioning. I believe it was over 120 degrees that day. There is a special kind of karma reserved for those that have so little compassion. We only bought 4 gallons and probably could have done 2 or 3.
The next gas station 30 minutes up the road was charging less than 6$. Very disappointing. You're little sign out front that says you have to pay more because you're out in the middle of nowhere is rather pathetic. Do you really think your brothers and sisters are so ignorant? God bless you. I hope you figure out at some point in your life that profits don't equal peace and happiness 😊"

I was about to pay with my card when my dad decided he’d pay using cash instead. I didn’t tap it on their POS system and not even 10 minutes later my bank sends me a fraud alert for $0.68.

Also, the bathrooms are FOUL and there aren’t price tags on ANYTHING.; This gas station is owned by con artists the owners hide in the background and pose as managers or supervisors. Their name is (Son)Shadon or chitah and Dad's name is Ram. They intentionally avoid pricing to get you off guard at the register. They also sell expired food.; Dirty, foul smelling restroom, rude staff that pretends to not know English, outrageous prices.  example: 5.99 for a bottle of water. Don’t go here.; Price gouging at its finest. They wanted five dollars for a 32 ounce fountain drink that would cost $.99 at a Circle K. They wanted five dollars for a small bag of pumpkin seeds. Additionally, on a taxable item for example, nail clippers that were supposed to be $3.49, they charge me $3.99 but the receipt did not charge tax. So on top of all of the insults, they are also cheating the state of California out of tax revenue. If you can, avoid this place at all cost!; Absolutely disgusting bathroom. Feces everywhere. It is obvious whoever works here could care less about their job. Every single window washing station was bone dry so if you want to clean your windshield while you get gas, go somewhere else.

I rarely leave negative reviews on businesses, but this gas station was exceptional."

Some guy was trying to get gas and had an issue with the pump but it was the cashier's fault and she did get it reset but once the man left she did complain about his attitude somewhat. Wasn't overly unfriendly. There were no signs anywhere requiring a mask and I didn't have one on when I went in so I guess they finally dropped it.

Looking forward to the hotel being opened in a couple of years. The view is wonderful!; So we made a stop in amboy, ca which is a ghost town but its been preserved and might be making a return hopefully,  half the rt.66 leading up to it was closed up which is unfortunate but its open to locals.  This is one of my favorite stops of the whole trip because its historic sign and the building that was kept in good condition,  the place was open to the public and you could buy drinks, gifts or whatever you need.  It was very hot so be prepared if you come in the summer months,  we got the famous cream soda not sold anywhere else ive been.  It looks like they are fixing the place up and putting in new septic lines and renovating everything which is good.  I definitely recommend you stop here to support and check out this historical landmark along rt.66 and hopefully they fix the road so its completed soon.; I found this gem 💎 on my way to Golden Valley, AZ. I found it so unique and cool. I had to walk around the whole area. I had to take the pictures of everything and the a picture of the highway 66. Saw the hotel stop to go get a snack. Walked around everywhere it was it was a perfect day. The weather was perfect, and there were so many other people here to enjoy this location of route 66.; We spent the night at Amboy Crater and needed gas. They were just a few miles away.  Yes, we paid top dollar (6.49 gal) and was happy to pay the price for a few gallons so we could get to Arizona. This dinner was very popular back when Route 66 was a thing. Loved the atmosphere inside! Not much has changed. The lady inside had to unlock the old gas pump and pump the gas for us and then pay inside. No such credit card pump like today.  We had a pleasant conversation with the lady. The old closed motel is next door with views of the lobby where you would  check in. Check this place out if in the area.; Service station in the middle of nowhere in the desert along the legendary 66. Fantastic place to stop and imagine the past. The lady at the shop/bar is very kind; there is also a book where you can write a few lines to remember your passage in this unique place!"

Not a big deal, easily fixed on her end, but then she started blaming me for her misunderstanding and saying that that’s not what I said. I carefully thought about what I was saying as I was saying it. She then went to fix it but still misunderstood what I was saying and failed to resolve the issue. Even then I had no issue with this completely resolvable situation but she was still blaming me for misspeaking when she just did not listen.

If you are going to work a cash register you are going to have misunderstandings sometimes, but to start assigning blame for the misunderstanding is so unprofessional and so ugly. I’ve worked as a cashier and had countless misunderstandings but I never blamed a customer for them even if it was their fault occasionally.

He was polite, professional, courteous, and quick.; We were headed to City of Rocks State Park in truck and camper then hail and torrential rains came.  We decided to get gas and hunker down for the night here.  Clean and staff are busting their butts to keep customers happy!  Best part, they had a dog park for dog!  Thank you for being there.; This station is not set up to be RV friendly. The pumps are too close to the building.  Getting out with a trailer is very difficult. The dump station and air pump are in the only single lane exit from the pumps,  so when you dump you're blocking everyone else in. The pumps are terribly slow. Filling our 75 gallon tank took 25 minutes after waiting for the RV ahead of us to slowly fill his. The Staton is filthy,  trash all over. The windshield cleaners are all worn out and the soap buckets are full of dirty solution.  Pumps wouldn't print a reciept, so had to go inside and wait for the cashier to finish hugging her friends and then she didn't have a clue how to give me my two receipts (since the pump shuts of at$175, I had to pump twice and needed two receipts). We have stopped at Loves all across the country but this station was a terrible experience for us and the other patrons that we encountered during our visit."

There are 2 Love's across from each other on State Road 90.  I visited the station on the East side of the road.  I doubt you'd be disappointed in either station, in case you end up in the West side.; This was the first Loves I ever visited. ❤️

This year, I had a bathroom emergency while moving with two cats in tow. I called ahead, quickly told the wonderful woman that I had fuzzheads in my car and she went out to check on them while I recovered. She is an angel and I will love her forever. Thank you so much 🤗; Huge parking area for truck drivers. The ladies working were very friendly and so nice.  The ladies restroom was clean and tidy.  They also have nice walking trails.  Beautiful views all around! Just wish Love's would add a different variety of fast food restaurants.  Can't tell you how sick I am of Subway!; Loves sits immediately on south side of interstate in 2 locations (or at least 2 major signs) on either side of street. No time/space to figure out which location had truck/rv lanes. Happened to notice semi going into location on left so with very time whipped truck/camper that direction. Then the sign said ""autos and RV'S"" go in first driveway...well there was no way an rv was going to get in and around that tight space. So I followed the semi into an equally tight and congested area for diesel fuel. What a cluster. Couldn't get pump 18 to work so went in and waited in line (1 cashier and no one at diesel counter) to get someone to help me. Nice fella came out and couldn't get it working either so he said I should take my credit card in and prepay...stood in same 1 cashier line...then got fuel and went in to get receipt (in same 1 cashier line) because the pump ""receipt print failure"". No one at diesel counter and 5 lanes of diesel were completely full and backed up. Will probably avoid fueling in Benson from now on.; Shower cleaning has to be addressed. At 8am all the showers are empty but not cleaned. I waited a whole hour to get the code. I think our time should be more valuable. We should not lose a whole hour just because someone is not doing their job properly."

We all know they just don't want to be responsible for keeping the area clean on a short staff. The area was closed off just so they wouldn't have to deal with vagrants or ACTUAL customers.

My husband proceeded to take our dog on the leash to  the grass area to the side. While approaching the grass area our dog was attacked by a much larger dog not being held on a leash. He started attacking both my little dog and husband. I was in the car and watched whole thing unfold while screaming for my husband and dog. The larger dog belongs to a homeless man that hangs out outside. My husband gave me my dog to check it and ran into the Pilot gas station to get help. He ran in so fast that he didn’t bring his cell phone. He then asked the women working to please help let him use their phone to call 911. Instead he was told “no” and there is nothing they can do.

I have gone before to this place for an oil change and they didn't put the cap back on fully which caused me to have to get my car towed in and have it fixed. This was a couple of years ago.

I meant to go to the 76 across the street because they had such great reviews. Unfortunately for me I made and error and ended up here. I went for a smog check, and while they did that, I was treated rudely.

At one point they refused to give me my medicine for potential allergies.
I've taken this medicine for over 15 years, why in any world would it suddenly effect me?!

Half of these people probably got their license from copy and pasting from the Internet.

I'm a medical professional and to see such failures in their career is astounding.

Get it together guys, it's not like it's bananas out of stock and a simple complaint. No, this is people's livelihood that they're messing with.

You are not God, you're a pharmacist. Your job is to fill prescriptions, not have personal stipulations over whether or not MY MEDICATION is needed, YOU ARE NOT THE DOCTOR.; Hi. I love the coworkers, very sweet and have good manners. Deli has very good meat selection. Mariano is just a lovely person that works there. He is very polite."

I do not deserve to be treated poorly by there employees. I was down there this evening and I received poor customer service as well as poor attitude. The employee by the name Sivestre has a terrible STANK attitude. It is not my first time that I go to this 76 gas station and I am confronted by his terrible lack of customer service skills and terrible attitude. If you are in a business of servicing customers then you should not be rude or disrespectful to them. I asked him to repeat what he had said because I am hard of hearing and when he did so he gave me a terrible attitude. I had apologized to him and said I am sorry I am hard of hearing. And he still continued to give me a terrible attitude. I addressed his terrible attitude and I told him that he should not be working their if he was going to continue to berate the customer. The situation escalated and he continued to give me a terrible attitude. That I am sorry is completely unacceptable to my standards. I too am in a business of hospitality and customer service and I just would never treat any of my customers that way. It is offensive, disrespectful and does not provide an inviting establishment.  Please check your employee! It just feels that now a days customer service is dead.; Crazy woman who works the cash register. Rude and just a bad person.; AVOID this gas station. The owner is rude and the service is awful. I went in to get my tire pressure adjusted and they charged me $10 for air. Completely ridiculous I have never heard of any gas station charging for air. When I asked the guy to apply the $10 to plugging my tire he asked me to not come back and stole my money that I had  already paid for the free air. The owner is a Thief. The gas here is overpriced and charging over a dollar more than the gas stations close by. The staff is unhelpful and This gas station is a total waste of time and money.  Don’t stop here your better off running out of gas than going here. All the gas stations in the city are helpful but this one is a total fail all around.; Needed to use the bathroom, they told me to buy something.

And here's a pointer too if you don't put condiments on the burgers don't close the top bun leave it open .maybe some kind of salt on fries would be nice ! Overpriced garbage..; Very friendly staff,  and the food there is amazing! They have great carne asada tacos and the best hot wings in Mohave County!"

Not only is it fully stocked with everything I need for my grocery runs, but it also has an incredible hidden gem inside—an amazing bar with fantastic drinks and service.

The bar is such a unique touch, making grocery shopping much more fun. After grabbing my groceries, I stopped by for a drink and was blown away by the variety and quality of the cocktails. Their craft beer selection is impressive, and the cocktails were expertly made—especially the margarita, which was perfectly balanced!

The staff at the bar were super friendly and attentive. They took the time to chat, recommend drinks, and make sure everyone was having a great time. It's clear they take pride in both their mixology skills and their customer service.

Whether you’re shopping or just swinging by for a drink, this Fry’s is a must-visit. The convenience of doing your grocery shopping and grabbing a drink afterward is unbeatable. I’ll definitely be making this my regular stop!; Oh, Fry’s Grocery Store, where the prices are sometimes low and so has been my experiences with the customer service... let’s just say, Ive been treated with a dash of unwelcome seasoning at times! During my last visit, I had the ""pleasure"" of interacting with Renee, the front-end manager (or so I’m told that’s her title). Picture this: I'm standing silently at the register, waiting patiently, when suddenly Renee hits me with a ""I’m busy, you will have to wait, I’m helping someone."" It was delivered with the charm of a fire alarm at 3 AM.

Renee, if customer service were a dish, you over cooked it and it’s not very appealing. My jaw nearly unhinged and hit the floor the way she spoke to me! There I was, just trying to get a bit of assistance, and I received a side of sass I never ordered. Renee, dear, here’s a tip: a simple ""I'll be with you in a moment"" could suffice. It’s the second time this particular person was this rude to me. Let's hope third time’s the charm, or I might just start shopping where the managers know how to put a “ hello, how are you” before the unpleasantries and unwelcome follow up. Geez, is this what customer service has come to?; Modern place , very organized
They have shade over the parking garage in Arizona It's big.
Also, have a Starbucks inside
And dining area feel like in the restaurant if you wanna take a break shopping and just eat.

Fresh veggies and fruit.
Great choices for bakery, breads, cheeses, and deli meats.

Always has someone at the register to check-out.
Has many self check, but I never use them.
There is plenty of parking with lots of covered areas.; Yes, this Fry's is huge. I've been to a couple other's like this one, in neighboring communities. Clothing, home decor, extensive beauty/toiletry section, pet supplies, etc. Great produce, deli, fresh meat, selections to shop.

I was trying to finish my trip peacefully and I went to the gas station that I came off right at the exit and they said gas was $2.99 a gallon which seems really good to me so I proceeded to go to this gas station and instead of $2.99 it's said $3.19 a gallon at the pump.   So the cashier decided she was going to refund my money rather than giving me cash back since I did a debit purchase which where I'm from that's the way it works but apparently not in Kansas.  So luckily I went to the 24/7 store where April works and if not for her I would have spent even more money and wasted it because I have to wait 3 days to get my money returned from the young lady down the street that did not listen to me and she ignored my request which holds my money up.
April not only listened to me,  she went out of her way to save me even more money so I didn't have to take cash out of the machine through the ATM.   She gave me another option where I could get my gas for $2.94 a gallon with no hassles.  This young lady also went above and beyond and found me some baseball caps that I wanted to buy as souvenirs for my daughter to take back to Ohio.  The selection wasn't quite what I was looking for so she went out of her way went to the back room and found more ball caps and I found 2 that I was very happy with and I know my daughter will also enjoy.  It is very hard to find employees as willing to help as April I certainly hope that she not only gets a raise maybe even a promotion because she certainly deserves it you should be very thankful to have a girl like her on your staff.; They were so helpful! They told me that the receipt would be at the pump, and then I got distracted, chatting with a friendly customer, and realized 40 miles down the road that I hadn't pulled the receipt. I need to turn the receipt in for work. I called, and within two minutes April had found the transaction, printed a duplicate for me, and sent me a copy. That's 5 star service!; I will never be coming back to this gas station ever again and I recommend nobody comes to this gas station unless you want your money stolen!! I went to this gas station to gas up went inside to prepay put $30 on and I only gassed up to $16 went back in to get the rest of the money refunded back to my card that I did not use of the $30. The person working inside had told me that it would probably take about 24 hours for the money to go back on my card well it's been over 24 hours and still no money back on my card!! I called my bank and they told me that it shows no money being put back on my card from 24/7 travel store! So at this point I'm starting to realize that the worker and or this company stole my money!! I even called back today to see if the store manager can fix my problem and she refused to do anything to help me get my money back! If I don't get my money back I will be contacting a lawyer and I will be suing this company for stealing my money!!; Stopped for gas and diesel fuel
There were no diesel pumps at the gas side. I pulled around to the diesel pumps. They had the large nozzles for semi trucks and no small nozzles for pick up trucks. I put in my credit card and the screen said to see the cashier. I went in used my credit card and returned to the truck. The pump wouldn't work. I went back into the store where the clerk told me I had to pay for the fuel in a different building. So I walked over to the other building and paid for fuel. Now, know that I am on oxygen and use a portable on demand concentrator. I was having trouble breathing at this point. No one offered to help. I fueled the truck and we went back on our way. I will not patronize this business in the future.; On August 13th myself and many others became stranded due to pumping water into our tanks from this gas station. The money that was paid was returned for the repairs and hotel stay for the night. I’m still out the $36.10 that I paid and never used any of the fuel. I’ve spoken with Butch from corporate and this store manager. They have to talk to the president of the company is what I was told. That was over a week ago and now I’m completely ignored. They were negligent and owe the $36.10. One star is actually too generous."

Bathrooms were clean, tidy and double locked.

Came with a subway and Dairy Queen so roommate and I stopped for a cold sweet. Has built in convenience and gas was a decent price.

Clean and nice. Will stop here again on trips back in that direction.; They never have any hot food. The coffee is always empty/out of order. I've come here 12 times, at different times of day and different days of the week and it's always the same.

It does have an attached Dairy Queen.

I would pass and wait for a different travel stop.; Most organised qnd clean loves I ve ever seen.
Thanks; Usually at Loves you can pump your fuel move forward and run into use the restroom. Not this loves. They literally stand outside telling you to leave as soon as your done pumping. You try to get out they yell at you that they don't care. All this while two pumps open and nobody behind you waiting. Maybe instead of making truck drivers leave without using the restroom they should try cleaning. All the trash cans over flowing. The place is gross. And the lady that was yelling at drivers is so rude. We only stop at loves but not this one ever again.; So this is the only Loves that I have ever stopped at that I have been told driving a sprinter van that I can not park over night. Been doing this for 3 years. First time for everything so if you drive a sprinter van steer clear of this location they will make you leave.; CDL DRIVERS do not waste your money or time on this Loves. Customer service is horrible, not allowed to pull up to go inside after fueling. They kick you out as soon as you’re done. No respect for truckers.

There were other travelers doing the same thing, yet the code of road kicked in we all got what we needed along with some common curiosity and respect. Now you can't beat that being on the road again, now can ya, most of the truck stops, do have it where, you can pull off to the side of the store, take a nap, and don't have to keep buying something every time you go inside the store. Way to go Travel Store, and try for your hospitality and generosity, it is really appreciated.; Great for a quick stops & a quick bite to eat. McDonald's, convince store, outstanding bathrooms, friendly service. Can't ask for much more than that for a quick stop from a long day driving. If you don't want to eat at the McDonald's grab a premade club 🥪 and get back on the road quicker. Not kidding when I say they are the best premade sandwiches I have ever had at a convince store.

I did have a disgusting issue with her staff member Daoud because he wanted to be rude, lazy and not get my lottery from other side & even lied on her about there policies stating he can’t jump from one side to the next per the store manager to get my scratch off tickets and if I wanted some then I have to get it from only his side we’re his register is. Then he got upset grabbed the tickets from other side ripped the first one then tapped it and like McDonald’s does you want more I can give you more attitude, later to only find out that was not the case. So Kay I appreciate you helping me from the other side and even listening to what I expressed yesterday then when I called affirming talking to this employee and him apologizing for his actions. This is the kind of acknowledgment managers like her, that are respected and it gives shoppers/customers like myself clarity that things can be resolved without further escalation who deserve better treatment when we spend our money in establishments who have workers who only work for money and not genuinely customer oriented. Thank you again!!!; I love this place they have a variety of products from food to drinks cigars beers and fast food.; Who’s working up there right now?  There is always a “be back in 15 minutes”sign on the door. I was up there 15 minutes ago and it was locked. I walked back home (maybe 10 minutes away) then walked back up there and the lady locked it again. It’s been locked twice in less than a half hour. Look at your security camera. You’ll see me on there, obviously outside, twice in the past half hour. What’s that “worker” doing?

What more do I need to describe? I think what I said paints a good picture of what happened"

Everything is explained and the workmanship is excellent. That old term, 'neighborhood mechanic', comes to mind here. If you listen and learn you will find you feel like part of a real family. I actually enjoy stopping by.; Outstanding service! I've been getting my gas here for a while, but they went above and beyond when my car had a check engine light. They immediately offered to take a look and fix the issue. Since then, I've relied on them for various services. Excellent communication, fair prices, and it's great to support a family-owned business. Highly recommend!; Im a car dealer and I get all my work done here honest & fair; Great shop right here. Honest and good work. I’ve had my car fixed here a few times when I used to live right down the street and they do a great job. It’s very hard to find a trustworthy mechanic these days so if you want a good one bring your car here. They work at a very fair price and don’t jerk you around. Also the owner is a great guy.; I went in for an oil change today. I spoke with George. George told me it would take an hour. Great! I had just an hour to spare. So I walked home, then walked back after an hour.
He hadn't even started. He did somebody's car ahead of mine instead.

If you make a deal, keep it. Otherwise you lose business.

This is a really convenient full serve location right next to my house, but now I'm never going back. Live and learn, huh George?"

Plenty of RV/ truck parking, and they even have a free RV dump/ water available.
Fuel prices were also very decent when we went but will obviously be subject to change.; Very clean bathrooms. There were several employees. They were all friendly and busy. I did buy a ready-made sandwich. One of the slices was a little dry.  So pull from the back, lol.
But I judge by clean updated bathrooms. So yeah, this goes in my file of 👍  places to stop.; Pretty clean but I'll echo what others here have said: be careful about buying stuff and check your receipts. We forgot our USB charger so picked one up here during a break. The price was unlisted and of course ended up being like $20.

Worse still, it was in unlabeled packaging so the origin of the product is unknown and it did not work. Plugged it in, nothing. The final nail in the coffin was the caginess from the cashier's when I walked back in and tried to return it. They eventually did but only after having me fill out a form asking for personal information: odd! The cashier couldn't tell me what the form was for and the whole experience was just strange.

TL:DR: clean but watch your wallets, maybe buy stuff elsewhere.; AVOID this place. And probably avoid all 24/7 Travel stores. First, the advertised price of gas is a total scam, as other reviewers have noted. You end up paying $0.40 per gallon more than the advertised price for regular unleaded without ethanol. Also, the market and bathrooms are a major step down from Love's or Maverick or most other chains. I guess they stay in business because many hwy travelers are unfamiliar. Shameful business practices. Kansas should insist on truth in advertising.; Manager and staff very friendly and helpful.  Very clean.  They should be proud of the product they put out there.  Customer service is dying in America,  but places like this provide hope."

He told me it's not my truck it's the trailer. He can't fix it. Well this all happened in about 10 minutes. We went back inside and the bill was $75. I asked for what? I did make a bit of a argument about it, I'm a company driver also. I talked them down to $38. Which still is a bit out of line. I was thinking like $20.00. which they laughed at. Guys, just a friendly suggestion. If your going to do a trucker that way, at least have him pull the truck in the garage and since there was 4 of you in the office at least 2 of you can pretend to try to fix it at least that would look a little more better.

This one star is about the sushi place inside of Fry's!

As we were walking into Fry's last night, we learned about $6 sushi Wednesday from a sign in front of the entrance. We became very excited because we've always loved their sushi! When we walked up, there was only ONE (gross looking) package that said $6, and NOBODY was behind the counter. The hours on the sign said they closed at 7 and it was only 6:45. When we asked the deli clerks, they told us that the sushi people were affiliated with a different company.
Overall, I don't know who to speak with about this matter. I am very disappointed.

(A HUGE thank you to the deli clerks! Not only were they genuine, they were EXTREMELY helpful... 5 stars to them!!); Everytime I shop there you are either out of stuff or I don't make it home with something. Today was no exception. On my receipt I paid for but not in my bags. Again. To far to drive back to store. Tyler was bagging,talking, talking ,plus he was so dirty smelled terrible,needs pay attention to bagging. I think it's great that they get the opportunity to work but hygiene is important. Now I got to run to store closer to me because item that I didn't bring home was something needed for dinner; 9:00 at night 35 people online. They don't have any cashiers.

Will not be going back again.; So I have to admit that after reading the reviews of this place I was a bit nervous to go in but as soon as I did I was impressed it's not a big truck stop by any means but the food is good on both sides the bathroom was clean and had plenty of variety of snacks drinks etc.. there is some semi parking spots not alot but some... the cashiers are friendly and willing to assist you.

thank you for the great service ☺️☺️; This is kind of a half way point between Seattle and Spokane. The fuel prices are always the cheapest between the two cities. There is a variety of snacks , food and sundries at reasonable prices. The  restrooms are  clean. But   prepared  with patience for the place is always busy; You save 10 cents by paying cash which means there’s a dozen people inside all trying to pay and lines of cars waiting for a pump, literally blocking the parking lot and entrance. Had to back our RV out and go across the street. They probably lose more customers than they make with the 10 cents off. Wasn’t worth it for us.
Edit: their response speaks volumes about their customer service.; One of if not the worse truck stop on i90. Sure they have cheap diesel but you get what you pay for. Fuel island and bathrooms are disgusting, workers hardly speak English and don’t know how to operate the scale correctly. Much better options locally."

Thank you!; So check it out this is a gas station, how many people right reviews about their local corner gas station. Well I guess I do and there is a really good reason for it. This gas station is actually really nice.

There pricing is not the best, the truth is there are two other Shell Stations in the Costa Mesa area and both of them have better pricing but they. It's are dirty, scary and have ZERO customer service. So if your looking for the best price then this station is nit for you.

What this place does have to offer is clean fuel stations, a clean liquor store or or convince store that offers a little of everything. There is a great touch less car wash that actually does a really good job. I wish the dryer stayed on a little longer because it's not the best but I love that there are no brushes.

They also have good customer service and I say that with a smile on my face. I mean the employees are nice, they say hello when you walk in and they answer yes and no questions. I guess they probably are very knowledgeable about the chips and candy that they sell I'm nit really sure. Now the owners on the other hand are really nice. The older gentleman that has been around for years seems super nice and his daughter is awesome. She helped me figure out a solution regarding their new car was. She literally went out and we walked the car wash together. Super nice and super helpful.

Regarding the price of fuel, at the time of this review pricing was around $6.30 for a gallon of diesel but because I shop at Ralph's I saved $.30 a gallon. Sometimes I save $1.00 so shopping at Ralph's and buying from Shell really pays off. Plus the Shell diesel is really good.

This place always has nice cars!! There are a couple high end dealerships in the area so there is a good chance you will see a few exotic car or two. Also on Saturdays and Sundays  many of the locals pull their high end cars out of the garage and head to the local Cars and Coffee.

If I owned this particular gas station I would specialize in some really good unique snacks and turn my little liquor store in to a local cormorant high end pit stop for the locals and offer hard to find beef jerky, mustards BBQ sauces specialty candies from around the world.

With all that said this is my favorite gas station in Costa Mesa and for that I give them FIVE STARS!; I love this gas station! It has everything in one place. The car wash is quick and on Tuesdays they have $2 off the car wash. The convenient store is clean and has a variety of snacks. Great and friendly service! 5/5!!!; This 5 star rating is mainly for their Car wash system. My car was extremely dirty with tons of dust and water marks and it came out looking brand new! I also liked that the car was used brushes to clean the car and not just water jets like a lot of other car Washes do.; If you need to interact with attendant please do not go here. The male attendant was completely rude. I needed help with the pump not accepting my card. He grabbed my card and as he completed my transaction he gave me a lecture about not reading the screen completely. How would I know to see the attendant if I didn’t read the screen. He was very rude and degrading. Please beware."

The sign said to use the hand dryer -- which doesn't exist. This is insane in the middle of a pandemic of a virus that spreads by air.

The pump doesn't accept Google Pay despite having a reader for it, and there was no squeegee, either.

On the positive side, the carwash is good, but be aware that only one of the two bags is touch-free.; Great stop gas, big shop, car wash & touchless with vacuums and hose for mats. The works and conveniently off 95; I'm not always a fan of Shell prices for gasoline since I believe I have a good understanding of how the fuel industry works but I would say that this facility was really nice when it comes to taking care of the car. They had a nice car wash and car vacuum system that was effiecienly placed and well serviced our van.

A poor excuse of a truck stop!! Don't stop here!! Pilot and Flying J need to clean up their act. I'm getting a Loves account.; This was the worst experience I've had ever at a truck stop and we travel a lot. The employee making sandwiches for subway was so rude practically hollering at the girls (young girls) trying to order a sandwich. Turned down a gentleman and his teenage boys for their sandwiches. The light in the woman's restroom was out so the stalls were almost dark. Darker than I feel comfortable using.

I guess I found out why! The pads were placed in the calipers BACKWARDS first. The thicker pad was placed on the inside causing the pistons to SHATTER! I called him to explain what was happening because I was having a LOT of squeaking. When I took the pads out and calipers apart, this is what I found. No one else has touched these brakes! Now I have to come out of pocket to buy new calipers because he swears up and down that he didn’t do that. But you can CLEARLY see the indention where the pistons were pressed against BOTH pads at some point. He said they were never put in wrong, but these pictures prove otherwise. I will never be bringing another vehicle back to Dent’s…. EVER! Poor customer service! Absolutely rude response when being proven wrong. I don’t care if you’ve been putting on brake pads for 50 years. EVERYONE makes mistakes. But it takes a REAL man to admit when he’s wrong.

All parking is paid basically.
Pilot is sucking off the backs of drivers and it's getting worse. Spending THOUSANDS a week in fuel and they have the nerve to charge parking.

LOVES is looking like a great alternative; This is the dirtiest pilot I’ve ever been to. The cashiers don’t have much to do since it has self checkout stations. The bathrooms are disgusting.

The staff is 🔥 👌 amazing, there was a beatiful blondy girl folding towels, she is so nice and kind.
Outside you have plenty of spaces, trees and enought pumps. ⛽️
This store has an Arby's and many food options around.
There is a QT with truck services too, the gas is cheaper there in case you don't have any discount in Pilot.
I think they have an issue with the Laundry place 😧
Definitely a place yo come back and the next time I'll enjoy the showers 😉; It was nice to find parking around 830 at night. But they have way too many tape. Parking reserved and the cattle trucks really really smell; Review based strictly on stopping here, paying at the pump, getting fuel, then leaving. I did not go inside the store.

Wide open, easy access gas pumps. Lots of parking out front and on the sides. An RV or vehicles pulling a trailer would have no issue fueling or parking here.

Seemed to be a decent amount of big truck parking on the rear side as well.

Facility was clean. Very convenient, easy off, easy on interstate access.; Rude store manager, they refused to remove trucks from the reserved truck parking that didn't pay. Worst pilot I've ever been too.; Is usually a pretty good store to stop at I’ve always enjoyed the stop here.  Could be in a better spot than where it’s at. It’s not in a horrible spot it’s upfront but it’s off to the end of the front row.  AT&T phone signal comes in pretty good here with the 4G.  Breve always had friendly service here people are nice and the coffee is always good. There seems to always be plenty of parking But it does eventually fill up so I wouldn’t get here real late. However if you do be do you have reserved parking for about $12."

When I questioned this sudden change, I was led to speak with Lisa, who I'm convinced is not only the store manager but also a terrible liar. She fed me some nonsense about creating a better experience by segregating big orders. What a load of garbage! None of the other 47 Krogers I've been to have such a ridiculous policy. I asked if this was official Kroger policy, and she had the nerve to say no. It's clear to me now that this manager is instructing her employees to profile customers as potential thieves. How absurd! If she's so good at spotting thieves, why isn't she out there solving retail theft and making millions instead of managing a Kroger? Are Kroger stores just mini dictatorships where managers can make up rules based on their own biases? This is a dangerous path that could lead Kroger straight into a lawsuit. Maybe Lisa needs a lesson on not jumping to conclusions about customers. And those lies she told me? Pathetic. She couldn't even own up to them when caught.

Came to park and do laundry. Parking was a success. Called the store from the parking lot to see if their laundry facilities were, in fact, working. Was placed on hold. After fifteen minutes, I walked to the store. Still on hold, I spoke to the same person that put me on hold. I explained that I was on hold, showed her that I was at the 17 minute 25 seconds mark and counting. I told her I needed a simple question answered if she wasn’t too awfully busy. Which, she wasn’t. I washed my laundry in one machine, and in an effort to wrap this up quickly, I paid for the two lower dryers. When they were half way through the cycle I checked the lint filter. That’s when it became most obvious, there was no heat. Although, I made absolutely certain to set it to high heat. This isn’t the first time in 33 years of being out here that my lovely wife has allowed me to do laundry on my own. I went and spoke to the very not so busy young lady with the big bull nose ring, what with her indifference towards me, said I would need to speak with the manager. I already knew where this was going. I chucked my stuff in the two upper dryers. They are working. I wished the manager would put some sort of out of order sign on them, but he didn’t. The website that this fly by night laundry company has, goes straight to GoDaddy as a website available for purchase. The phone number? Yeah, they were closed ten minutes before I discovered this minor issue. Sure, I’ll get my $4.00 back in a month or six, but I’ll never get the time of my life I’ve wasted back. For that, there is no amount of compensation. You’ve been warned. 6/10/24

I'm a truck driver, and once, after freshening up in the shower, I forgot my headset there. I was almost driving away when I noticed a worker running after me with my headset. She didn't give up until she made sure it was in my hands. A big heart and dedication to her job! Thank you, my rescuing angel, for pulling me out of this trouble. Keep it up!; I walked in with my granddaughter and stood in line for 20 minutes and couldn’t get any food out of the Chester deli.She came out and assisted everyone yet I was first in line,rang the bell 3x and even another person in line said that’s crazy you were here first.A young man picking up dishes was told to go help me and he apologized and said I am sorry I don’t know how to ring up.I told the attendant at the gas pump is there someone that can help me we just want food out the deli and they said oh that’s it and acted like they would come help me and went back to talking.I literally at one point stood in the restaurant just so she could stop acting like she didn’t see us.it wasn’t until I asked for the managers name she came over and didn’t apologize just rang me up n walked away. I have been stopping here since I was a kid and never experienced such behavior. Only difference between me and every other guest today is I am black. Nice to know you employ staff that treat people so poorly .The young Hispanic man that works there just kept apologizing saying I am sorry I don’t know how to ring up.
If your of color I would suggest you go else where."

What distinguishes Gas N' Grub is their outstanding ""DoorStep Drop-Off"" service. During my visit, the cashier introduced me to this excellent service by handing me a flyer.

It’s not just about the convenience of home deliveries; it's a unique opportunity to win fabulous prizes with each order. This month's top prize is $200 worth of free gas!

The innovative idea that each dollar spent provides an additional entry into their monthly giveaway brings an extra thrill to everyday shopping.

The amenities at Gas N' Grub are top-notch, with a well-stocked C-Store, cozy restaurant, clean restrooms, an air pump, and even propane services. The option to pay at the pump adds to the convenience, making refueling quick and effortless.

My experience was exceptionally satisfying, and I highly recommend Gas N' Grub to both locals and visitors. Whether you’re in need of a quick stop or you're intrigued by the chance to win with each purchase, Gas N' Grub delivers with outstanding service and innovative offerings.

Remember, they're open 24/7! Make sure to visit Gas N' Grub for a reliable and rewarding experience next time you’re in Bullhead City.; I use to stop there every day on my way home from work. Never again! .50 cents to just use a debit card. No matter the amount. This is getting ridiculous with surcharge on top of surcharge! Bye gas & grub! I thought you were one of the good ones.; I usually like this place and the people that work here, but they have a newer employee, an older man, apx 50s, maybe 60s, that is a complete jerk and has no business working with customers!
I stood in line to get my lottery ticket, check for the payout on it, and buy a new one, He made me get out of line and check it myself and get back in line again. He was horribly rude. I even had my cc on top of the ticket on the counter, so it was obvious I was going to buy another ticket. I made him cash the ticket, and when he tried to replay, I told him to forget it. Im calling his boss and won't go back until he is gone. PS Im local, so there goes all my normal lotto money to another store.; It was a 24 hour after 10 pm drive through.  Store guy was nice.; Yea I'm here at their drive thru and no one is showing up all there is, is this sign about someone is in the rest room."

We stopped here several times over our long camping weekend.

I came in here in the evening time yesterday and there was only one cashier and it was busy. No problem, I waited in line just like everyone else. When it became my turn I handed the lady at the register ( name tag said Dianne) my winning lottery tickets to cash in and to get more and she very rudely said “oh no you’re going to have to wait” and slammed the tickets down on the counter. And then when her co-worker offered to help her by opening another register she threw a fit about that as well. I also encountered her being rude to other customers that were waiting behind me. Everyone else has always been extremely kind.; Used to be so much better before it was cenex. Now there is obnoxious signage very little selection and a dreary store design.

I gave up. Will not visit again.; Would be zero stars if i could.  Was charged a full price refill for ice in my own cup.  What a ripoff.  This is how you want to treat customers?  I understand that the girl is new and supposedly the manager. You would think she should have a little leeway on things like that. She blamed the sign and the company.  Not a great way to keep customers when new options are available.  The wamego location is worse than this one.; I have to agree about all the other patrons who have given you 1 star because of the drive through.  I was SO excited when it opened! However,  just in the last month I kept track,  at least 4x a week four the past month we ended up having to drive around back and go in because no one came to the drive through,  I've even backed up over the bell!! We've been told that there's only 1 person working after 7:00. So why is the window even open after 7:00?!! Although customers are promised drive through to pick up their pizza or a quick pick up sandwich, you pretty much can't offer that after 7:00. Making a customer wait at the drive through window for over 5 minutes before giving up and having to go in is not smart business. And you can see by MOST of your ONE and TWO star ratings,  the drive though is your biggest fault.  Dont offer drive through past 7:00 if you don't have the staff.  Or maybe the pizza crew can help,  many times they are just hanging out ignoring the customer at the drive through.  My husband is a very frequent customer during the day and will only go there,  so daytime,  5 stars..... but 1 star for the very disappointing service after 7:00 with your drive through.; Short stop used to be a good store not sure if it's new management or what but I definitely will not be spending anymore money at this store or another short stop treatyour help better and get a decent manager and the high turnover might get fixed; Signs on door state masks required but they allow people in without them.  When brought this up, specifically about a guy breathing on the pizza with no mask, clerk spouted a bunch of nonsense on how those not wearing them worked there and it was okay.

When I tried opening the door one of the clerks (dark hair) practically yelled at me, in a very condescending way, that they were closed. When I asked about overnight parking, first she said no, then asked someone. Then, said no, in a nasty tone. No was fine with me, however, that didn't explain all the trucks parked on the side. Either they were trying to close early or the hours need to be changed on the website and on Google.Wow! She was so rude. She definitely ruined Sinclairs for me.; Used to make this a convenient stop between Denver area and points south along 285. Doubt I will again. Filthy, pricey, weird, hard to drive in and out of.

There's an exceptionally low CASH price that's $30 cents lower than the CREDIT price - to lure you into the station.

But - you will most certainly end up paying the higher CREDIT price when you leave - even though you've used your DEBIT!

According to the cashier - this is ethically okay to do - because they've covered themselves by adding a small sign underneath that says ""Cash & Credit Prices are the Same"" - (as if that makes it more clear you'll be charged the higher price)!

How about this for a novel idea... How about taking down all the lower-priced CASH signs - so I don't leave your establishment feeling like I was just manipulated?; Frankie and his team are the absolute best. They are quick, honest, friendly, and reliable. I do not hesitate to take my Model Y here for NYS inspection, tire plug, tire rotation, etc. Highly recommended!; Their gas price is predatory.

When most gas stations are still only charging about $4.2 per gallon for 87, they had the audacity to charge $5.19. This was on 03/06/2022. Completely ridiculous. I did not think they would price gouge to this extent since I used to trust Shell as a brand."

The cheese was not melted on my bacon, egg, and cheese but I definitely will try it again; TLDR: All Town Fresh has a great selection of organic snacks for reasonable prices. They also have mainstream well loved snacks like Cheetos so there’s a little something for everyone.

I’m from Vermont and at many gas stations there are healthy versions of common snacks like beef jerky. I was pleasantly surprised to see this store has similar snacks and at reasonable prices. Every time I’m on my way to the city I stop off at All Town and grab some cool new snacks to try. The building and this branch of the business is only 2 years old and it shows. The fresh food stands are clean and well kept. The bathrooms are spacious and the staff is attentive and keeps them clean. The staff is also nice and willing to answer my questions. There is a large selection of chocolates, chips, beef jerky and flavored nuts. There also snacks for people with dietary restrictions like stevia flavored chocolates, vegan chips, and gluten free baked goods. If you have a special diet or you simply enjoy well priced healthy alternatives to common snacks, All Town is worth a visit.; ALLTown Fresh in Hudson/Livingston NY is amazing. This gas station has it all. Everything is local-made or near it, decent priced grocery items inside, great selection of beer, yummy ice creams and snacks, the coffee is luxurious.  This place is the spot and passes the vibe check.  Customer service is also excellent.

With Grubhub coming soon. This is the only place I’ll probably order healthy and clean food from.  The food here is what captured my heart. Everything if fresh.  Their name and products match. Great to have this place near me. 😍🤤✨ come to this place you won’t be disappointed and it will leave you wanting more.; I was pleasantly surprised when I stopped to get gas and use the restroom, and discovered this hidden gem of a market. This market is unlike any gas station I've ever visited, with high-quality products and a high-end supermarket feel.

Everything in the market seems to be of exceptional quality, from the fresh produce to the deli counter, and even the selection of wine and beer. The market is clean, well-organized, and has a wide range of products available, which is a refreshing change from the typical gas station experience.

What's more, the staff at this market are incredibly friendly and helpful. They were happy to answer any questions I had and provide recommendations on their products.

I was really impressed by the bathroom door signs in this market - they stood out to me as unique and inclusive. The signs featured all possible genders, including a robot, which made a big impact on me.

In today's times, it's important to acknowledge and respect all gender identities and their respective titles, such as Men, Women, and even non-binary identities like the robot on the sign. Since there are only three single-person restrooms, it doesn't matter how you identify yourself - the bathroom is private and available for anyone to use.

This thoughtful initiative promotes inclusivity and acceptance, creating a welcoming environment for all.

Overall, I highly recommend stopping by this market if you're in the area. It's a great place to grab some high-quality snacks or even a full meal on the go, and the staff is an added bonus. It's a true hidden gem that you won't want to miss!; Well illuminated and fresh produce on sale, as well as processed foodstuffs. All gas pumps serviceable. Friendly staff. Clean bathroom and travel-related sundries on sale. Convenient location."

The parking isn't that many. You need to get here sooner in the day.; I hate leaving negative reviews but stopping here seriously ruined my day. It’s days like this where I wish pilot would go out of business and let more sapp bros or TA take over.
The employees are rude and there is an extremely long wait for a shower even though there aren’t many drivers waiting for one. That tells me that the showers need cleaned and they’re too lazy to get to it. There’s no reason that there should be many employees standing around, eating Taco Bell and on smoke breaks while there is work to be done.
If you have over an hour and a half to wait for a shower, and the patience to deal with employees who either have an actual child (she was like, 10? Maybe?) in the store working with them (employee shirt, and name tag btw.) and other employees that want to ignore you, then I guess I recommend it. The bathroom was dirty and the line was outside the door as they only have two stalls; so that was also a huge inconvenience.
The parking lot is extremely tight, good look getting your trailer into a spot unless you have skill or someone helping you. If you have doubles, triples or an over sized load don’t even think about coming here. Go to the next pilot a couple miles away.
Also, don’t eat at the Taco Bell, unless you don’t mind people coughing on your food and smoking right at the door.; Actually stopped at this pilot during the middle of the day and out of 15 showers not one was clean.

Almost 2 hours for a shower.; Parking lot two small, don't bother coming late at night, with the few parking spaces that are empty, there is not a lot of room in front to back your trailer in the spots.

The turn around time for oil changes, the assessment they do to warn me of any issues (timing belt had to be replaced), and the cost make it highly affordable. As a single mom on a disability, saving money and trusting the mechanics is crucial. Thank you, Westside!! :)"

They have a few slot machines inside, too. Service was good. Hardes or Carl's Jr depending on where you're from. The bathrooms were clean.; I have been coming here for a few years now and I never experienced such a bad service, the acting manager a really young fella was acting like he was the owner of the place, had me waiting for 1 hr before I came back to ask him about how much longer. He told me, he had few jobs in front of me. While I was waiting out site for the entire hour, all the bays were empty, so I decided to confront him and I ask him again how much longer and finally he decided to pull me in for my oil change. This place is getting bad, keep this kids doing this jobs and all they do is mess around and take to long and keeps us truck drivers waiting like we are on their time. To make things more interesting he close the bay door because I was outside watching them work on my truck!!!!; Takes forever for them to clean showers and get a smooth running rotation going to clean the 7 showers they have. Every time I'm here, without fail it's an absurd wait regardless of time of day. It's like preparing showers in a timely manner isn't a priority here. For the amount of truck traffic here this is a huge disappointment. Do better Roscoe Loves.; Hardee's side was great no issues. Older lady at cash register was extremely rude that I'm thinking of calling the manager. Was annoyed because she was about to leave the register to do something and I came up and just slammed everything on the table. Was about to leave everything right there and walk out extremely unprofessional.; Stopped here for gas on the way back to Illinois. Best prices around at 3:59 a gallon. Also picked up another cuppa coffee on the way. This loves is not as big as the one in Rochelle but it does have a few extras like a dog park.  Friendly cashiers as usual at loves. Looking for a nice place to work they are always hiring starting at $14 per hour"

The salesman Gene was exceptionally friendly, helpful, and low-key. No pressure and received a very fair price. Thanks Gene and Robbins for treating me so well!; Robin's chrysler and jeep dealer service department is awesome
We called the dealership as we were having problems with our Jeep. Grand Cherokee and the unfortunately, they told us that they would be about 2 weeks before they could look at it. But if we were willing to bring it in, they would put it on the scanner and check it out. 2 days later, they had my Jeep fixed. Which 3 other dealers could not fixed and they done it in such a timely manner . I was absolutely amazed great job service department.  Not many of you all out there anymore.; Buying my 2022 Ram 1500 from Robbins was one of the easiest car buying experiences I have had. I was referred to Robbins by a friend of my sons and my first thought was, why would I deal with a dealership 2 hours away. That answer became clear very quickly. I had already received quotes from 4 dealerships near my home before reaching out to Clay (over text). Clay called me immediately and had me a quote within the hour. With no knowledge of my previous quotes, Robbins beat all the other dealerships. By enough for me to take the leap and have them order my new truck. Clay provided constant updates and actually under promised and over delivered. I was told the truck would be ready around the end of Feb but it arrived on Feb 9th!! Not only did the truck arrive early but it was deliver to my house (2 hours away from the dealership), the tank was full and the truck was spotless. Garrett helped me through the warranty and paperwork side of the deal which was seamless and transparent. I have never negotiated a purchase, signed paperwork and received my vehicle without having to leave my home. If you need a new vehicle please reach out to Robbins, even if you live in another state!!; We had been searching for a Grand Cherokee for quite a while with no luck , Cameron helped us and made our experience amazing. He did everything to make sure we were at the payments we were comfortable with and made sure we left with the vehicle we wanted . Highly recommend to anyone looking for a new ride .; Called to confirm vehicle was available before taking off work and driving two hours to go see it it was so my wife and I drove up there and test drove the car. Decided we would purchase the car so sales man drew up the paperwork while we went to grab lunch across the street came back to find out that the owners buddy had been looking for a vehicle just like the one we were in the process of buying so they could no longer sell us the vehicle 🤬 worst service ever the also they knew we were both active duty military would recommend no one ever go here."

I'm even more appreciative as a woman who is learning to do some work on my own vehicle because I felt this was an easy conversation without judgement.

Thank you for my grateful piece of mind during my travels back to Long Island, NY! ❤️  😃 🚗; I’ve been here a few times with no problems however I take my car in for an oil change and tire rotation at 8am. It took them 2 hours then they over charged me and charged me $137. Never go to these people. They are a total rip off. I will never go back ever again.; I was in an accident and my car was towed to East Avenue Auto by HELP.

My insurance company wanted me to empty the car the same day and called East Avenue Auto on a conference call with me. A young man named Morgan assisted us. He said to come down and he'd be sure I was taken care of. My stress level was 119% but when I got there Mike G. was kind and friendly and Morgan took me to the lot to let me into my car. He was beyond courteous, professional and kind to me.

This could have been a horrific end to a terrible day but the staff at East Avenue Auto, a place I've never even been, really supported me and treated me like a valued customer. Thanks guys."

On the way home, my car broke down again!! It was towed to the nearest shop, who stated the fuel pump was defective and he asked if it was used. I said no, it's brand new, and was just installed at a different shop that I was driving home from.  Long story short, the shady mechanic at family auto NEVER PUT IN MY NEW FUEL PUMP!! He put his own defective pump in instead and never told me. I only found out AFTER trying to exchange the defective pump where I purchased it, and was told they dont sell that kind of pump!! I called family auto and Wilber admitted to switching the parts.  He said, it's not his problem because I left when the car was running! He told me to come get my original fuel pump, cursed at me and hung up on me.  I had to pay the new mechanic $180 bucks to install the new pump!  I have the shady mechanic at Family Auto admitting to fraud ON VIDEO!! So, I will definetly be taking him to court and will be filing my paperwork Monday morning!  I gave the owner a chance to make things right and at least pay me for the cost to have the new pump installed (180), he just called me names and hung up on me! See you in court! I wouldn't want this to happen to another person.  FRAUD!! Beware of this place!  Just look at the other reviews!; They should change the name to Rude Auto or Filthy Auto.  The owner tall guy is a cursing machine.  Definitely the type to bully you around to those that don't know much about automobiles.

This is the third time, after getting home and unwrapping them, they are already halfway dead, and they are not cheap.; Not only does this SUPER Kroger have everything under the sun they also have a distinct advantage over most competitors. They have a ton of checkout clerks to keep things moving nicely and also have two giant areas of self checkout registers so that you never find yourself really waiting to checkout which has become such a great benefit these days.

There is no easy access to the location unless your already driving east on Bell Rd, and the inside of the store is significantly smaller than other QT’s, leaving you to ping pong off of others in the store.

There is still bird poop on the hood and headlight covers??? If this was a “Diamond Detail” what do lesser services look like? I wish I could get the $20 dollar tip back that I gave the cleaner.

Edit: the next day I stopped at a gas station right near cobblestone. I walked back up to the Manager Blake and showed him the pictures of the detail yesterday. He replied “that’s not right” he immediately took my car himself and now has a team doing a full detail!
This is for my Mom when she makes it out of the hospital.
Blake, thank you for making this right. Cobblestone is lucky to have you and your leadership. Thank you for going over everything with a fine tooth comb. You didn’t even know about this review! Just did the right thing. That says so much about you!; If they offer you the “$80 interior detail with a free Diamond level wash” don’t waste your money or an hour of your time. I had to run the vacuum again to clean up obvious dirt and trash in the carpets. Sun flower seeds in the seats that didn’t come from me. Floor mats were never touched. Dried milk stains in the middle of the seat that were never touched or attempted. Seems like the detail spray just got sprayed at random in the car and they walked away. I get it’s not a super professional detail shop but for $80 I’d expect little more quality.; I would suggest not getting your car detailed here ever. My guess is the salespeople work off of commission and you are just a number to fatten their pockets. (Again, that’s a guess). They spew so many empty promises at you that they don’t fulfill. They said it would take an hour to complete and that they would shampoo my floor mats, that they would vacuum my trunk, they would give me a vanilla air freshener and cut out the old ones, etc. It was about 90 minutes in when I thought it was a little absurd being that I was promised 1 hour. Yes, I have had cars detailed in the past so I knew it could take some time; hence, waiting to say anything. In any regard, 3 1/2 hours later they finally finish the half ars job! I am not thrilled and the customer service is lousy from the car wash standpoint. The customer service inside is great. I will not be taking my car here any longer.; So i used the express wash, and the towels were so dry that i asked the employee why it was dry they said its always dry.

Just don’t listen to the SIGNS telling you how much cash back you can request, the robot checkers won’t give you a hard time, but the human checkers absolutely will.

Your staff is always so helpful, and we appreciate you all for donating water to our growing band. Thank you!; Mateo at the Deli counter is amazing! I got to the counter just as he was closing up, he went above and beyond. He re-cleaned the machine and got us the meat we needed for a late night sandwich. The customer prior to us was unbelievably rude to him, and from what I can tell lied to his manager...Karen!!! Thanks Mateo for being helpful last minute, you deserve a raise!!!; A couple weeks ago I was here at the deli getting some roast beef and Swiss cheese. The girl with the brown hair with long nails who works at the deli was picking her nose 👃. Then wiped her nose with a napkin and then used that same napkin to wipe the slicing machine. So disgusting and she washed her hands but still. The fact that she didn’t think that this is wrong and unacceptable. Won’t be going to the deli again.; Nice staff exept for the guy of the clothing section. When I was looking the clothes, he would furiously grab the item I had just refolded and aggressively fold it again. I decided not to buy anything so he doesn't get bothered."

Really unsatisfied. I wish I knew her name... I called to let them know what happened. They said they would transfer me to management and they hung up on me.; I am doing instacart. Was only a 3 item order and was already at self checkout when they closed down all self checkout lanes and directed me to a line coming out of lane 11 that was 13+ people long. I had to cancel my order and waste my gad and time coming here for this to happen. Next time you want to do that open more than one lane. People have lives and some of us are trying to make money. Completely rude and unprofessional.; I like this Fry's, it's kinda funny and sad though that the Anbesol and Oragel are kept in the anit-theft boxes that a employee has to open for you before you can check it out......

This is far more than simply a regular grocery store...
Fry's has clothing and kitchenware. school supplies, household goods, vitamins, and supplements. They also have a scaled-down area that supplies your desires for automobile supplies too.
They also have a rewards program and tend to deal well with returns.
Nevertheless, I am that chick who loves Target too, So, with that in mind, Some of you may enjoy getting to know your local Fry''s Marketplace better.; This place screams QUALITY!!! I absolutely love coming here for my groceries! Customer service is always phenomenal! They always have everything in stocks and fresh produce!; For those who buy the prepackaged meals to go refer to meals on The Go price does not have anything that comes close to sprouts sprouts is far superior on their meals better selection prices about similar I would not eat fries as meals to go anymore; Dear fellow grocery enthusiasts,

I am writing this review with a heavy heart, a sore wallet, and a deep-seated disappointment in humanity. As a long-time customer of Fry's, I never thought I would be penning such a scathing review, but alas, here we are.

It all began with my innocent decision to use Fry's mobile pick-up service. Little did I know that this seemingly convenient choice would turn into a nightmare of epic proportions. On a fateful day, as I waited in the designated mobile pick-up parking spot, a rogue trolley cart decided to play bumper cars with my beloved vehicle. The result? A heart-wrenching symphony of metal-on-metal and a symphony of expletives from yours truly.

But the real horror was yet to come. I reached out to Fry's customer service, expecting a swift resolution to this unfortunate incident. Instead, I was met with a bureaucratic nightmare. Despite my desperate pleas and the undeniable evidence of the trolley cart's guilt, Fry's refused to take responsibility for the damages to my car.

To add insult to injury, Fry's had the audacity to claim that the damages were an ""act of God” because of the wind and not the lack of an employee being rushed by the manager in charge of putting the breaks on FOUR trolley carts. I must have missed the memo where trolley carts became sentient beings capable of self-defense. Perhaps they are secretly sentient beings, plotting their revenge on unsuspecting customers. Who knows?

In conclusion, my experience with Fry's mobile pick-up service can only be described as a ""cart-astrophe."" Not only did I have to endure the trauma of witnessing my car being assaulted by a rogue trolley with my kids in the backseat, but I was also left to foot the repair bill. Fry's, I expected better from you. Shame on you.

As for my fellow consumers, I urge you to think twice before using Fry's mobile pick-up service. Unless, of course, you enjoy the thrill of a potential trolley-induced car crash and the subsequent bureaucratic nightmare. As for me, I will be taking my grocery business elsewhere, where the carts are less aggressive and the customer service is more humane.

Sincerely,
A Disgruntled Customer; Very nice grocery store, lots of good fresh produce. Employees seem to be quite friendly and helpful. Good overall variety and selection. Coupons are what make this place great. Coupled with a pharmacy and gas station it makes it a very convenient store"

I’ve done stock work like this and ran stock teams in the past and this is a reflection on poor management.; I'm in the deli line for literally 30 minutes. I call the store to report the very long line and suggest they send backup as the poor woman behind the counter clearly needs assistance from additional staff. It's not her fault the station is understaffed. The person who answers the phone says she'll inform a manager, and I'm sure she did. A few minutes pass and I see a manager sheepishly emerge from the kitchen behind the deli. He nods hello to me then walks away. That is very poor leadership and a sign of a person who is just totally checked out. Poor show Fry's management - you understaffed your deli then failed to do the necessary work in order to compensate. It took me 40 minutes to get my deli meat, and that is absolutely unaccessible.; What an amazing store,it's like a high class Walmart, everything under one roof.

We watch the owner of the white truck pull it out and replace it with the black car. He didn’t even have a semi. The red car pulled it out of the spot to park his truck. All these guys drive container trucks. Pilot needs to address this. I called corporate about it and the RM should be calling me back in the next 24 hours. Showers were nice at least. That’s the only reason I’m giving it one star. Not to mention the guy cleaning the showers was super friendly.; Waking up a driver who is legally parked bc an other driver can't back is a no go. Yes it was an employee of pilot. Couldn't sleep at all after that. Now I have to drive without a proper rest. By the way if you're picking up your parking ticket make sure that you had paid for only one spot. They charged me double"

The women who work here act like they're in a street gang.  I saw them literally punching and kicking a customer who was clearly special needs.   I'm embarrassed for humanity when I look at the people who work here.  As a person who's spent many years in Charleston,  this location is the worst that South Carolina has to offer.   And to you ladies that work here that think fighting the handicapped is ok, well, it's not surprising when people look at the condition of your store and you as individuals.   There obviously isn't any standard for personal appearance and grooming.   One girl working at the counter actually smelled like tuna fish.

They never have breakfast items and what food gets put out is always old or burnt. The workers don't stock anything up..no fountain drink cups or straws, no coffee cups every time I go in this location. Honestly I don't see how it's still open. They should close it down and build a Spinks or Parkers there atleast there would be better food and drink options for customers. It must be nice to get paid and not do your job. Over heard the manager say she's been there since 5 am and she obviously just comes to work to do nothing.; The young male cashier was very helpful with new sunoco specials. Also he saw that I was short of some change when I went to pay and actually took out his wallet and covered me. God and this young man are so good. All the time. Best part is I've never seen or dealt with this guy ever. He was just being genuinely good person to a stranger.; I had the most barbaric and distasteful encounter with a cashier here. Just a rude, miserable, unprofessional, and very much sad individual. I don’t know what crawled up that little winch/cashier’s behind but 7-Eleven and Sunoco need to do better with their hiring process. If you don’t want to deal with people, perhaps you shouldn’t acquire a job that entails interacting with people. Be Blessed!; The time was 620pm, at 1984 Sam Rittenberg Blvd Store #2631. I was disrespected so much at this location, by cashier Fred Hazen.  I will never return!  I went in to use the remainder of my gift card to purchase gas. I asked for $15.00 on the pump. There was apparently only 13.86, so I said only run $10 please. He said okay, I left the store. He got another customer that left the store, to ask me to come back in. I Did! He told me my card was maxed out. At this point, I'm unsure how that happened, when he just mentioned the balance came on the screen as 13.86. I walked outside and called the gift card services. The phone rep did tell me the transaction was authorized and pending. I went back inside Sunoco, only to tell the cashier the card was charged. He strolled through his register, laughing and smirking, saying he does not see that transaction on his register. Then he told me ""I can call my manager but he is going to tell you the same thing"". I told him I would like to talk with his manager because I didn't appreciate him being very rude to me. So he goes to the back, I assume the manager was back there apparently he wasn't and he called them- I could hear him on the phone, He stated "" Yea this lady up here think I'm trying to steal her little $13.86, She got one of them prepaid card, I guess she call her bank, and they told her the charge is pending, but we don't got her money"". Just talking very rude on the phone about m , in front of other customers. I explained I wasn't accusing him personally of ""stealing my money"" but I knew the charge posted to my account. I asked to speak with his manager so I can explain it myself. I felt like he was making me sound more irate than I actually was. There was a line of customers behind me, so he told them all he's closed, and tells everyone to leave the store.  Very rude! As I talked to him, He told me he was going to call the police. I respond that fine. “I’m not being rude or nasty”. He called them on the phone and stated"" Yea I got this rude ""ass"" lady trying to say I stole her money off her card can I get and officer up here "" he was pacing back and forth behind the register being very nasty saying ""I'm done talking to you"",  ""He breaded (meaning he has money) and ""Nobody is worried about your little $13.86"" .Still in Shock, I had to push around him to get threw the other door as he locked them closed the doors.  There was one customer behind me, he waited with me, and gave his contact information. He knew how disrespectful he was compared to how calm and respectful I was with him. I felt belittled by the cashier. He totally embarrassed me. I was only trying to use my Christmas gift giving to me by my job. I was treated with the upmost disrespect.  I'm still very upset. Something needs to be done here with this situation. He should not be able to be rude to the anymore customers.; 2:40Pm Thursday Aug 20, 2015
The cashier on duty right now is so rude and nasty, she made nasty comments to us before we even made it to the register. Bless her heart, I guess she is just so miserable with her life, she wants us all to feel it. Personally, I think she should consider another way to make a living."

Bathrooms: For being a major truck stop, the bathrooms were clean and smelled like peach rings. So either someone ate too many and was making a deposit, or the tribal pads were top tier. Also, clap to flush the toilets.

First off, the 2 signs on the door ""NO HOODIES ALLOWED!!!"" (yes, all caps and 3, count em: 3 exclamations) suggested I wandered too far off I-26.

After that, the handwritten sign on the creamer machine telling me to stop opening cartons of milk for coffee since I'm on camera (see pic if you don't believe me) confirmed that I zigged when I should've zagged.

But, the coffee was fresh (no milk needed) and the attendant had such a friendly smile and greeting that I left with some confidence restored.

I wouldn't go out of my way to return, but if every I'm back on HWY 27, I would stop for coffee again! Smile while fixin your Java.; Pizza is good. Good lunch portion.
No problems with gas. Store was clean but haven’t used the restrooms.; Why does the hours say 11pm when they actually close at 10 pm?!?!

I think the employees were nice.; We usually love this gas station as we are locals and come here often. Unfortunately there is a particular employee who makes us no longer want to come there. Today my husband walked in to odder pizza. The employee was on the phone and rolled her eyes when she saw him. She told whoever she was on the phone with that she had to go because people were coming in. She asked him what he needed so he made our order and she was incredibly rude scoffing at him telling him it would be more than 20 minutes. This isn't the first time she done this to us but it will be the last. We will only be ordering when the awesome pizza guy is there who treats people well."

Feels like a 3rd world country when pulling into this truckstop. There is no room to park in the daytime. Forgot about coming here for the night stop.; Shower was perfectly good.
Low stars is the fact there are 4 wheelers parked in the truck lot. It would be real easy to contract with a local tow company to come through once or twice a day and remove any cars in the truck area. If you really want to warn them first maybe a large sticker that says ""not a truck"". When I say sticker I am being polite about it.; Where to begin.  This store is THE REASON why I will NEVER return to ANY Pilot / Flying J.  This was the WORST experience of my life.

Came in for a coffee and they were out of cream.  I waited for the employees to finish their conversation at the front, once I got a chance to speak, I asked if they had any half & half.

I was cut off and a guy in a vest told me that they only had the small cups, BUT THEY WERE OUT OF THEM TOO.

I found a stocking trolley full of creamers and I stocked their cream section. I then paid 5.33 for 2 coffees and for volunteer work.

There is no manager here because the dirty bathroom was much cleaner than the store.

In short:  RUN AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION & AVOID PILOTs FROM NOW ON!!!; I have never seen such unpleasant, rude and abnormal people as the security guard and the women at the checkout!!! A SHAME!!!!! Hey normal people, better drive around this gas station!!!!!!!!!; People get lazy, I know how doing showers especially when busy when the truckers come in but stay  on top of it/take pride in your jobs.

The only downside from this Loves Truck & Travel Stop location is that they only have one food merchandiser what is Arby’s.

Most Loves have a Sub way but east of the United States it’s less common.; This review is STRICTLY about the mgr MEGAN. She is rude and very inconsiderate.

Plenty of well maintained restrooms.; Congratulations Love's Garden City Georgia employees and managers stepping up to the plate and hitting a home run for all of us here truckers and residents...showers and food and fuel.
You show what it means when the going gets tough the tough get going.  I suppose it's always been that way here in Georgia but we all appreciate you very very much. Y'all come back now!; Staff was friendly and it was easy to find parking on the passenger vehicle side. The tractor trailer area looked pretty full when we got there around 10:00; My star goes to the Manager who allows Local Drivers to park their private cars in the truck parks so as not to lose their position as if they were paying for that service or perhaps the Love's Corporation needs to investigate the Manager for letting private cars park (Four wheels) in the 18-wheeler truck spots. They come in the morning, take out their 18-wheeler and park their private cars in the same spot…In the video you can see the Jeep in the photo leaving for the 18 wheel to park, I don't think it's fair for a local to occupy a parking lot in this way as if it were his property; Google reviews from the public OTR, I guess Loves Travel Center has answered your concerns and made an update no passenger vehicles parked at the truck parking lots Bobtail parking spot are parked at it’s spots, and trucks with trailer spots are halfway empty.

Staff were amazing and helpful, the shower cleaning guy does an excellent job by keeping the showers clean after EVERY use. I am extremely grateful and impressed on how clean and nice these showers were. Felt like a brand new woman when I got done taking a shower!
Due to me not having the Pilot points (we don’t have Pilot in the town I reside) the shower was $17. BUT WELL WORTH THE WHOLE $17!
I had my own personal items, however, they had soap, towel, washcloth and shampoo in the washroom when you arrive.; morning without breakfast (unfortunately 8:00 there are no tasty hot burgers, etc.; Small station with trucks parked in every direction. Only a few diesel lanes but no DEF at the pumps? Inside restrooms were small and could use attention.  Staff on the Pilot side was polite and quick to assist when asked a question. There is a Subway inside, but the lines pretty long at lunchtime.; Diesel pumps didn't want to pump, Handles on both sides were defective and would cut off every second if you go past the sweet spot which was near impossible to hold due to being so sensitive. No DEF. Tiny lot. Didn't go inside. Sketchy people walking around, Bro walking around mumbling and throwing gang signs doing a bad attempt at crip-walking. Just another moment in Augusta, I'll just fuel in SC.; Poor customer service, the outdoor terminals do not accept the Fuelman credit card. I went inside to pay at the counter, as I do at all other Pilot/Flying J stations, but the employee said she could not accept my corporate Fuelman card at the counter. She told me that she could only fuel diesel, but I need 87 octane gasoline. At all other stations, I've always been able to pay at the counter with no issues. She also told me that I could fill up at a nearby Circle K. I hope management takes steps to resolve this issue. This occurred on May 26th at around 1:05 AM."

I would recommend not getting any water from this establishment.; It's small but has alot to get the staff is absolutely wonderful 😊
Car wash is amazing also; One of the pumps has a cut in the hose and sprays all over you and the car. Unfortunately I don’t remember the pump number but when we tried to go in to let them know, there was a sign on the door that said “bathroom be back”. We waited for more than five minutes and checked the restrooms but no one was there.

This happened at 5:10pm on 8/9/2023.; I bought ice and a soda I was charged 6 dollars by a woman who said she hate her job and wanted to leave. I ask her for help but she was on her phone the whole time. I went back for my receipt and ask her for my full change, then she came out screaming. There was no one in the store but me. It seems everyone wants to rip u off here in hilton head. I am never coming back here.; I am generously giving this establishment two stars instead of one, because I still appreciate Blan, and what this place used to be. In the past 12 months this convenience store has turned into so much of a dumpster fire that I am surprised it isn't a hazard to the gas pumps. complaint 1: the staffing, bring blan back. complaint 2: the bidis are fake. I used to enjoy a quality solar bidi stick from behind the counter that would bring me Nic buzzes and joy for at least 4 days. Now? Well now - I can't even promise you the device will rip once. It is appalling, offensive, and a disgrace to this island. AND THE B**** W THE SP*RM EYEBROWS WONT LET YOU RETURN A DEAD ONE.  RIP BLAN."

All in all pretty good for a kroger; Kroger is my favorite place to grocery shop, but this location has a customer service problem. I was insulted by one of the employees and then when I confronted her about it she tried brushing it off as a joke and told me I shouldn't be so serious. No one was laughing at the so called ""joke""; not even the employee who made it. I thought jokes were supposed to be funny, even the insulting ones. What she said to me was plain rude and uncalled for. Even another customer commented to me about how rude it was. What did I do to warrant that type of mistreatment? Nothing.; If you like sandwiches with filthy and infested lettuce make sure to always buy sandwiches here at this Kroger 😀 if not go to Publix at least their subs are consistent and higher quality. Super disgusting and can’t believe no one double checked the handling of the sandwiches. Will never come here again.; Edwin in the pick-up department has very bad customer service. They canceled my order without notification. And Edwin being the department lead didn’t want to talk on the phone to explain why they canceled the order. I won’t be doing pick-up service anymore.

It was so refreshing to deal with someone who cared.  They did a great job fixing my car at a reasonable price.; My neighbors highly recommended Bushes’s Auto Repair Shop to me when I needed new brakes.  I met with Mr Bush and he not only did the Brakes, but checked everything else out for me.    He is very knowledgeable and professional.  I will return to his Shop for any other auto needs in the future.; I met Mr. Bush and his sister-in-law after the passing of my father. I inherited Daddy’s car and had to be sure that it would make the 6 hr. drive to coastal NC. He worked us in, throughly checked the car, discovered dry-rotted tires, and sold us 4 new ones. All for a fair price! Highly recommend!!; I primarily get oil changes from Walmart, but recently, my car needed to have some major repairs. I took it to a shop in Augusta as it was closer to my job to have it diagnosed and was told that the repairs would be approximately $2,500. They listed numerous unecessary services/repairs-of course I declined the service. I moved to Aiken about three years ago and remember my dad talking about Bush's Automotive and I pass it on my wy home. I stopped in and spoke to Mr. Bush regarding the repairs and I was pleasantly impressed. He thouroughly explains the parts necessary for the repairs and offers a fair price. He takes pride in his work and is fair and honest. It is refreshing to find that there are still honest people in the world who aren't out to take advantage and rip off the public. I am so glad to have found Bush's Automotive as this is the new ""hospital"" that my car will be going to if/when it gets sick. :) God Bless; He's such a great mechanic, but also a kind man. I waited until I've been to him multiple times to leave a review and this is my honest opinion. The things that personally stand out the most to me (aside from the fact that he does great work) are his honesty, integrity and respect. I have had many encounters in the past with male service people who either treat me as if, because I'm female, I have an inability to comprehend what they're saying, and / or try to take advantage of me financially, assuming that I don't know general costs and won't know the difference. This gentleman has never done that, and as a matter of fact, he's recommended against doing things that I wanted to do, things that he didn't feel would be effective or solve a problem, when he could have just agreed for a quick buck. I have a LOT of respect for this. So yes, by all means, bring your vehicles here, knowing that you are in the hands of someone who cares. Thank you."

i went their without knowing this place.i would recommend this place for your car service; They are very conniving. I went in there woke up early in the morning drove down to get an inspection and the first thing he did was look the car up and down looking for anything you can find with a nice brand new big set of tires sitting outside he decided he wanted to tell me before even doing an inspection that my tires won't pass and I need to get new tires otherwise forget it knowing that my inspection is up in a couple days because I told him that and they saw it brand new stack of 10 tires sitting in front of the place of course he's going to say I need new tres. If it wasn't tires it would be wipers and if not wipers it will be something else because they don't make money on inspections define ways to scam people and buying something else to make money nice shop guys; Never used their services, but pulled in to put air in my tire the other day.

This is one of the few places in Augusta that has electricity right now, and they can’t be arsed to update their hours, either on Google Maps, Waze, or even their own website, so as to reflect the fact that, no, they are currently not open for 24 hours. Also, coupled with this, I tried calling them MULTIPLE TIMES throughout the day, including to verify if I could fill up after the curfew that is currently in place in the city.

So, thanks for my wasting what little gas I have in daring to drive over there 45 minutes after “closing time”.; Worst customer service especially the old lady is not good at all. She is horrible horrible. We are human and your customer, we are paying and spending money at your location. Treat us with a normal behavior, not with your grudge and attitude. If you still continue to do like this with your customers then no one will be coming here and you will lose business soon. Management take some action soon!!!!!!!!!!; The 2nd time I have stopped here and parking is a mess…. Only one spot that was free… kinda had me wondering at 2pm so after a 10hr break it was easy to tell…. Same trucks still parked…. So that means they not watching over the lot….. u got tons of drop trailers and bobtails taking up spots and trucks just sitting…could be a nice spot if there was a place to PARK"

I'm very grateful for their help and would highly recommend them to anyone!; Today, 7/11, I broke down on the SS during rush hour.

When my car battery died at Nassau Community College, I contacted Geico roadside assistance, who promptly dispatched Gemma's Towing & Automotive.

Week after week we visit the deli counter. Week after week we are so disappointed. We ask for very thin- we get next two sizes up. We ask for a pound (1lb) and we get have a pound. We have complained multiple times to the store and nothing comes of it. It’s very costly for any elite cheeses or meat. Every costumer should be treated with custom elite services. The wait time alone is painful. Then to get home and not have what you asked for is even more painful. AND if you complain then we are making the others behind us experience their own painful story’s …….. I know this because we too stand behind others complaining. That is why when it’s our turn we give very detailed instructions……. And never listened too or delivered excellent service. Bring Chris back! Have him train how excellent service should happen. Please Fry’s Manager make change happen. Enough is enough. Next time we will allot enough time that you can witness all your unhappy customers.
I give this Fry’s two⭐️⭐️only because they have a great stock of items and the store is always clean. Sucks that you have poor customer service at deli counter and truthfully you can never find the store manager.; I do not recommend grocery pick up, horrible customer service and expect a 3-4 hr delay from time of pick up. This was not just a one time incident, this happened twice. We got a message that order was ready, drove down from Red Rock and they said it's 3-4 hr delay there is a computer glitch that is sending notifications out. Why can't they notify customers that they are running behind?  They are opening a new fry's in gladden farms and I hope they have it figured out by then.
Management has to do better.; I was here earlier today. The kid bagging my groceries accidentally dropped my watermelon. Totally not a big deal! What I didn't like was the manager coming up behind him and being rude to him. The poor kid tried cleaning up the mess and she rudely told him to stop cleaning it and finish bagging the groceries. The cashier was kind. Poor kid, it totally wasn't a big deal. The manager could have handled it better.; I love this Fry’s. It is the best one in town. I just posted this in hopes that their management might read these. The only complaint I have is you need to have your baggers stop pulling out their phones while bagging groceries. I have been there two weekends in a row. And the same kid bagging my groceries pulled his phone out at least three times while bagging my groceries with a long line behind me. I’m sure he takes his phone into the restroom with him so it is not sanitary for him to grab it and touch our groceries. I don’t want to say his name.

Gas is reasonably priced. The bathroom is clean and always smells like cherry lollipops. They also have drinks, pastries and coffee plus a little repair shop. I like this station a lot.; I am a long time customer of a Brewster Shell. Its the best vehicle inspection place nearby. I have an excellent experience with Brewster Shell. Great service! Very impressed with customer service and professionalism of workers there,  Barbara is always polite, courteous and makes every effort to work around my schedule.; To whom it may concern:

I am writing this letter on a beautiful Saturday morning after visiting the Brewster Shell service station located at 1450 Rt.22 in Brewster, NY 10509. I made an appointment to have my 2015 Toyota Camry inspected. At the counter was a gentleman named Bill. He told me that I did not have an appointment and that there was nothing he could do. I assured him I had spoken to his daughter two weeks prior to reschedule a missed appointment I had made earlier to get my car inspected. Bill said that he didn’t doubt the appointment was made but that he does not see me in his system as having made one. Then he made a comment that I was being accusatory by saying he should honor the time and appointment date I made. I told him that I wasn’t accusing him of anything because I traveled over 20 minutes to his station and expected my car to be inspected. Instead, he claimed that it was okay for me to call ahead of my appointment two weeks ago to cancel, but it’s not okay for him to not have me in his system. When Bill uttered those words, I was in shock to hear that he was claiming not inspecting my car was okay because two weeks ago I called and canceled an appointment. He then hurried to the garage saying he’s losing money talking to me and that I can make another appointment. I said, how do I know for sure if you are going to honor it? He disappeared into the garage. I was shocked to know that Bill runs a business with the Shell image and logo but fails to provide the service his parent company (Shell) admonishes. The service Bill provided was beyond awful and certainly could have been easily rectified with an apology and a cordial attempt to make things right for me, his business, and the Shell brand.  I am certain Shell will rectify this situation and repair the harm that was caused by Bill and his horrible customer service.  I consumed more than 40 minutes of my time in travel and exhausted several gallons of gas going to the Shell station and back, to be confronted by a lack of professionalism with poor communication skills that made a bad situation worse. Thanks to Bill, my car is still in need of inspection because inspection appointments are weeks away from today. I am worse off now than when I made the appointment two weeks ago at this Shell Service station.; Everything which one expects from a gas station. Even during a blizzard, Brewster Shell stayed open. All pumps were in good repair, with digital displays showing the gas prices and consumption. Discounts are available for those participating in Shell’s customer reward programme. The store was clean though small, offering coffee/tea by Keurig. The attendant was a friendly foreigner. On site is a shop for automotive repairs and inspections. Outside is a bench for travellers who may want to repose.; Bill and his team are so helpful and polite. The price was more than fair and reasonable. The convenience they offered by picking up and dropping off my car spoiled me. I am going to be a customer for life."

No judgment about the forgetfulness. No assuming that he was some kind of scammer. Just all-around friendly, genuine, small-town kindness. Thank you so much. We will make a point to stop at this gas station for all future trips, as we drive to St Louis often.; When you're in a rush the last thing you need is a defective pay at the pump card reader and keypad. No signage up, but as soon as I walked in they told me they knew about it.

At the register you have to prepay for them to authorize your card. They need a specific amount. How much gas do I need? I have no idea. I'm travelling and the price has been different at each stop.

Then after you guess, if you're too high, the extra amount is held for days before it gets released back to your card.

Need a receipt? Guess what, you have to walk back inside, wait in line and ask them for it.

A whole lot of hassles and extra steps simply because the pay at the pump wasn't working and no one thought to put a sign up saying so.

Thanks for wasting my time this morning Pilot!; This is a medium truckstop on the small scale, parking slots are a bit tricky to back into because they are in an angle so you can only do your backing setup in one direction, there are a few vip reserve spots available if you feel special or in case you're running late & there are no more free spots, you can see and reserve your spot via the app on your way to it so no 1 takes it, try the app it's easy to use & will save you time. 4 food you have the incredible diverse selection of: Subway! This pilot doesn't have premade food like other pilots so you have to make the difficult choice of deciding which restaurant to eat so good luck! Parking lot appears decent until you take a closer look around the edges, there is all kinds of garbage spread around @ the back of the trailers including trucker bombs (pissing bottles) restrooms are somehow ok, there's showers on this pilot including laundry so this pilot is almost complete, no repair shop on this pilot sorry! but if you call road service with the app they come to you!"

Surprise no one hasn’t been hit yet. Love’s needs to fix this ASAP.; Staff was very friendly, including the person who was outside cleaning my respects to him. That day it was super windy and he was all over on point to have everything cleaned. He was very friendly made me feel welcomed. Inside the store was very clean and organized, i bought a taco pizza from taco johns which I highly recommend. Very delicious and their crew was super friendly as well. Overall i highly recommend this place. This was on 04/28/2024 around 8:30-9am; Kareem (I hope I spelled it right) is absolutely amazing!! This is my second visit to this location, and he has went above and beyond both times. No reason, just because. I didn't have to get anything corrected, didn't have to ask for sauce, napkins, or utensil. It was in the bag already. Super professional while seeming like you've known him all your life. Customer service is A++!!; I am extremely disappointed with this Love's. Went in to get some coffee since I'll be driving all night and guess what? There was no coffee made. The only thing they had is that fresh ground crap which I don't like. It tastes gross compared to the other coffee. Now I have to either waste time and stop somewhere else or go without coffee."

I spent a lot of time with my 3 dogs at the dog park and it’s a fantastic setup.

Great gas prices
good selection of foods and beverages. Almost like a grocery store.
A smaller version of Bucees

CONS
The exit is not well marked and it's easy to miss.
entrance back onto the interstate is a few miles down the access road
no fresh brewed iced tea; OWNERS:
Sad to see how soon this location is going down maintenance wise.
Big pot holes at diesel pumps.
Showers are beautiful but are not kept clean, really need maintenance.

I told her “I just want to buy a drink” and she screamed “I’m calling the police right now, i do not care” - I then told the other people arriving that she’s denying customers. I will be calling her manager tomorrow and Shell corporate. She deserves to be fired for the disgusting behavior and shouldn’t ever work in retail again. I hope she takes this review as a sign.

First, myself and another customer who was at tbe register was locked inside. Next the cashier called out the other employee or manager out to come out and confront the shoplifter. This employee grabbed his arm, shouted and cursed at him then out of nowhere for no reason punched him directly in the face. The shoplifter was of no threat towards this employee. He did threaten him, nor try to assualt the employee. He was complying all the way. Then after a few more words, again the same employee throws and lands another punch on the shoplifter for no reason. This is all happening within 2 feet of myself and. 3 to 4 feet away from the other female customer, and we are still locked inside unable to leave. This whole scenario puts myself in harms way.  The cashier could of easily unlocked the door but choose not to instead he comes out from behind the register then takes his own punch shot at the shoplifter for no reason. The other employee then turns to me (after the cashier told him I wasn't a shoplifter) with a threating tone saying, "" You're stealing too!"" And he takes one step towards me becore the cashier tells him to stop. 30 seconds later the cahier finally unlocks the door. Your employees and company endagered my well being by doing so. What if the shoplifter had a gun or weapon, or if he chose to retalitate to the punches? I would have been caught right in the middle.

But, because of poor customer service I decided to go out of my way to go to this circle K and my goodness was it worth it! Layla, is an incredible and amazing person who works here. 10+ stars for this one. Go here if you want awesome customer service. Trust me this is coming from a 10+ year neighbor; DO NOT BUY CIGARETTES FROM THIS LOCATION I bought a pack a Newport shorts for my mom and when she opened them it was packed with tissue😡 and the top was glued shut. They didn’t want to give new ones or a refund.PATHETIC!!!!; The staff here are amazing, helpful and so friendly! This place has so many choices and great inner circle rewards. Its a high volume store but the line moves quickly. I'll be back and thank you.; Worst customer service I've ever come across!! Night shift really needs to work more on responsibility for bringing up a customers items and not demand for things to put in his hands or else he won't ring up the item. He refused to listen when I asked for 2 items behind the register and only allowed me to buy one when I asked for 2. He repeatedly said get out of his store if I had a problem with it. I just can't believe how horrible he treated his customers. Monday  September 2nd at at 5:15 am; Best circle k ever! Working at a convient store is so hard and man these ladies that work here are amazing they work so hard and are so sweet. This store is so high traffic they do an amazing job! Thank you all for your amazing service!! Keep up the great work!!"

The prices are good make sure you have a Fry’s card to get added discounts,  this store also has a gas station on the property that is also Fry’s and the nice thing about it is they have the gas price in the store.  One of things I also noticed was that the store was clean including the bathroom.  A must place to go.; Lovely store! I would like to request additional BeatBox flavors at your location. (Fruit Punch, Or Watermelon) They also have multiple variety packs that would be awesome to see in store! Thank you!; Last of my back to school items found at Fry's! Great prices and friendly interactions with staff.; This is a great location. Safe, easy and clean. They have everything you could need or want from a grocery store. Starbucks, sushi and even a wide selection of clothing. Bathrooms are clean. Employee's are always very friendly and willing to help with all of your shopping needs. On Wednesdays sushi is $6 for roll, fyi!; This location is 50/50 on employees bagging my purchases, lately but mostly today I notice 3-4 lanes with no baggers. However I do notice new 2-3 blue shirt employees with radios leaning against product isles chatting about personal stories while the cashier and customers and myself bagging purchases. It's an insult to spend lots of money nowadays on food to watch management employees stare at you while doing there work ! Next time these employees will be aware of how I feel ! Disrespectful! Update, return on 5/19 to the same old front line management doing nothing but watch customers bag there own groceries so I voiced my options and there reply was "" bagging is not our job "".. maybe I should apply for assistant manager and lead by examples ! These managers are too comfortable."

The parking area needs to be pressure washed and painted. The staff were working hard as usual to put things back in order.  I will be back....💯; New Coffee area. Grinds beans on the spot. 1 minute. Real whipped cream. Whe whole store was spotless. Even restroom. Men's room. This 'QT' quick trip really stood up to its name.
The best 'grilled cheese' ever. All food made to order on touch screen menu. Awesome.
OH. Free air. No tire pressure guage on hose but I can understand. Would be stolen.
Only complaint. The drink lids are stuffed so full when filled, you can't get one lid out. Five pop out on floor, which I put in trash. Quit stuffing the area where lids go. All QT's do this so it's  probably a 'corporate' procedure, and problem.; Staff is fine store is fine,  what is not cool is that new recipe on the donuts icing , i know the management or whoever made that call to switch up the icing had to of noticed the nastiness of that new icing, all the donuts look wet and runny icing.. change it back please they are messy and more than half the donuts have the icing running off the sides.. and the vanilla cupcake cappuccino has been messed up for months this location can't seem to fix the issue of a thick powdered drip instead of liquidity like all other locations.; Bought a few doughnuts amongst a few other items from this location. Left the store and arrived at my job site few minutes later. Looking forward to fresh doughnuts to start my day off with only to find out that wasn’t going to be the case. All of my doughnuts were hard and stale. Disappointed is an understatement to say the least! Will never buy another doughnut from this location again!; Tried to take my 4 year old to the bathroom the workers have a piece of paper taped to the door with the words CLOSED Do Not Enter wrote in black marker. I almost opened the door until I seen this, then I see past the door where FOUR employees are standing there leaning on the counter talking and laughing. There was another lady who tried to go in after me and you can still see one employee standing there laughing at her as well. I'm VERY upset with this as it's only 7 pm on a Tuesday and there are NO other indications they were closed ANYWHERE in the entire parking lot or even anywhere else on the store. Just ONE piece of paper taped up on ONE door, while they even had merchandise sitting outside still waiting to be brought in on the pattlets. I even took photos but I'm unable to upload them for some reason."

While the pumps were a bit finicky and the place admittedly look very sketchy, this gas station really helped me and my friends out tremendously. TLDR gas station is great and came in clutch when we really needed gas otherwise we would have been stranded at 11pm at night with no one around.; I was coming back from Cannon Beach, and had not gotten gas while there. I ran the car down to 9mi until empty, at 11:30pm. This gas station keeps their pumps on, and totally bailed me out of a bad situation. I can't speak for the store, since it was closed at the time, but the gas station itself saved me a lot of hassle. Just keep in mind you need to follow the instructions on the pumps.; Open when it's nighttime and you need gas. 24/7 good price.; My car was overheating and I pulled over to call AAA or see if someone could help me at the station. “Hosein” very kindly offered to look under the hood where he discovered there was little water left to cool the engine. He filled the reservoir and GAVE ME a container of water to refill the water if the heat guage started going up
again! What a wonderful thing to do. I am SO grateful I made it home safely after that—-at NO charge. Thank you Hosein!; We were on our way back from the coast and were nearly at the E.

Recently the card reader won't even allow me to insert and the tap function hasn't been accepting my card. I prefer to not have to go inside and pay so I likely won't be back.

Prices are the cheapest around.; Great gas prices and just around the corner makes it convenient. Service is always great, between the guys pumping gas, and the clerks.; Cheap gas but bad customer service.  Manager on duty today hasn’t got a clue about customer service.  The pumps ask if you want a car wash today, whether the car wash is broken or not working, and sure enough the car wash was not working.  Went inside and I asked the manager for a refund.  She said I couldn’t have one, but I can come back when the car wash is working or use the car wash at a different location.  What an awful system, with even worse customer service.  Never again.

They have the cheapest I have seen. Very clean store. The clerk was nice and I will definitely stop back by when I'm in town.; Definitely not impressed with this place. They need to be more aware of the items they are selling and what's on their shelves. We stopped in here today as we were going out of town.

I was trying to just quickly grab a few things so that we could get back on the road as we still had several more hours left to drive.

A while down the road I decided to have a snack & realized as I opened the pickled sausage that it definitely did not look right.  It was extremely dry, smelled bad, and had some weird brown looking stuff all inside of it. Before I took a bite I looked at the date and it had a date of September 19 2022 on it. Upon finding this I decided to check the other sausage we had bought and the date on it was even longer ago February 7 2022!

I stopped in with my husband and ran in to use the restroom passing through Athens on i65. As I was walking back to my car the store owner began shouting at me that the restrooms weren't free. It's posted on the door so I intended to pull around to the pump and top off my tank. My husband pulled around to the pump and went in to confront the store owner who then started shouting about not wanting homeless people doing drugs in his restroom. We've been on the road for a couple hours and it's good to know I look homeless drug addict at this point. I wanted to give my money to local business but I suppose next time I'll take my money to Buccees anyhow."

They also carry non ethanol gas, should you need it for lawn mowers, etc. They also have an ATM should you need one.; This Exxon provides for your basic expectations in a gas station and convince-store setup. Inside you will find a fairly small retail floor with each aisle feeling just a little too close together. Each aisle has basic quick-select items you would expect to find. Some of these include dry goods, candy, chips gum, and other snack-type products. The back wall is cooler lined where you will find the common soft drink products along with beer and wine choices. They also have the odds and ends such as basic auto needs like oil, funnels, gas treatments, and more. The check-out counter has a variety of novelty items, lighters, a couple of warm food choices, and the almighty lottery machine and scratch ticket dispensers. And, in case there might be a few people who surprisingly don't know this to be almost an American tradition, behind the check-out counter are a large variety of tobacco products. Outside you find a small but mostly manageable parking and fueling area. There is just one fueling island with a max of four fueling spots. This becomes a bit congested and requires your best patience during the morning and evening commute times (rush hours). Overall,  a good place, as long as you avoid those rush hour times, for a quick fill-up, a cold drink, and if desired, a lottery ticket purchase.

I watched 3 people come, get gas, and go before th pump stopped. I had my youngest girls with me. The fact she juged my statement based off of other people's experience was pure ignorance.

The gas is no good.  If I were paying for the gas myself, I would never stop there.  The cashiers are very rude. Customer service is non existent. No restrooms, I guess they're too lazy to clean after their customers.  And why are they not allowed to tell you over the phone how much their gas is. Like I said  customer service is non existent.  Smh; No public restrooms needs to be cleaned up service is okay lot is clean employees are friendly just dirty; This location is great especially for the people who live in BFE or are passing through. They have great service and their hot food is pretty good. It brings me back to high school with our cafeteria food but just a tad better.

This used to be my go to gas station. Ive been going to this station at least twice a week for the last five years. However, everything about the store has changed in the last year. All of their good cashiers are gone. The credit card machine is never working correctly. Nothing is ever a quick trip to the gas station anymore. I don't usually write reviews, good or bad,, but the last couple experiences I've had with the OWNER working behind the counter were completely unacceptable. Just very rude and incredibly impatient. But at least I know know why he can't keep any employees working for him.; I bought a prepaid visa debit card and the cashier ""Steve"" did not activate the cards properly and refuses to return them because he doesn't have enough cash in the drawer and refuses to call his manager when I asked. Who is the manager at this location? And Steve was the rudest cashier ice ever met in my life.; Every time I go in to this place, they have no idea how to do anything. I go in, use a coupon, and they don't know how to ring it up. Every time they get the manager to show them how, and every next time they have forgotten again. Same people. Like dealing with 3 year olds. Too many other options. Avoid this place.; They serve in a location no one would want to serve in

I used my bank card to put $25.00 in the tank. I checked my account. There was an additional $125.00 and another $25.00 pending charge. I circled back and asked the clerk..He explained that happens when you used your debit card and by pass the pin. He also said it will fall off after 24 hours.
Today is Monday, I purchased gas Wednesday  or Thursday of last week. The original $25.00 posted the next dayI wish I could screen shot this part of my account. Due to security reasons I'm not able..
Be careful using your bank cards.; 10/23/23 Wonderful gas station with everything you need. I unintentionally gave the attendant (He easily could have been the manager, I'm not sure) an extra $20 bill. He was kind enough to return it to me. I appreciate his honesty and excellent customer service. I will continue to travel to his store six hours out of my way from Chicago once a month (23-mile travel) and buy his products. I also really like his deals on incense. Thank you again for your honesty!; Prices are not cheap if someone  does fraudulent charges to your cards.

Even tho I was driving then and working as  lead programmer for DoD then. Still not old ;); Stopped on my way home to get an icee beverage and while dispensing the handle popped off for no reason. The cashier lady (blonde with white nail polish) loudly tells me to put it down (I was trying to at least see if I could put it back on) as if I did something to break it! So I tell my son we’ll just share the one we already dispensed and as I’m about to turn around to go pay, there’s a random sauce packet in the floor that I step on and the “politely rude” cashier is right behind me saying “I knew that was gonna happen” - again as if it’s my fault I stepped on it when I was just trying to go pay for one stupid frozen drink. We finally pay, but the lids don’t fit right on their drink cups, so my son is trying to secure the lid and she says “ can you do that outside, you’re getting stuff on my counter” Ok yeah, let’s take an I’ll-fitting lid outside without securing it so we can spill it all over ourselves or our car.

Don't employ zero work ethic derelicts like this.; The staff was particularly unfriendly. I bought a coffee at 10:30 and they kicked us out. I don't recommend coming to this gas station. Bad review; There are just too many issues here, and way too often! Pumps are outdated and always in need of repair. You are lucky to find even half the pumps ever working for cards and almost never for receipts. The staff always acknowledge the issues but the owner does absolutely nothing to fix. The pump areas are always filthy and disgusting and while this is caused by disgusting customers dumping coffee and other things on ground, other stations clean their pump areas. Very surprised this location being in disrepair is tolerated by the franchise. This used to be a great place and no other station in this area is kept this poorly.  Very disappointing."

I said why and I am a customer I just paid for my cappuccino and she said it doesn't matter that I must go outside. I just looked at her in disbelief and speechless. What do people and places like that expect for people to sit outside and freeze or whatever in the elements that a customer can't stand to wait for a ride when their car is broke down. There were no customers and this worker didn't even turn the pump lights on or the street sign so business was already hurting.

I think it looks worse for someone to be loitering outside rather than inside drinking cappuccino. I will never spend a dollar at this store again and will discourage others from doing so also.

Checkout is pretty good, too.; Great prices every day. Clearance specials are always fun to find. Wine selection is amazing.; Always friendly staff. Much prefer shopping for what I can here to shorten those dreaded Walmart excursions."

We won’t take our vehicles to the dealership anymore. Karl got our vehicle in and out for an oil change without an appointment, and called first to ask if it would be ok to replace the air filter, all at a fair price. We trust all the mechanics at Buchanan’s whether it’s for routine service or diagnostics and repair. Highly recommend pulling up to their full service pumps when you’re getting gas if you have the time, they do a fantastic job.; I came in at 7 am for brake pads replacement and a new rotor.

Great job!; Air conditioner was on the fritz -- blowing hot air!  Karl was able to slip my car in and, after replacing a leaky condenser, got the cold air flowing again.  Great service, great people, and fair prices!  That's why I've been going there for service and gas since the early 1990s!; Pulled in next to gas pumps because there was an extremely severe thunderstorm and I was having difficulty seeing where I was driving. A very scared young mother with kids in her car are next to me. Employee from the gas station told us to move if we weren’t getting gas because other people were trying to get gas. I don’t think anyone was stopping to get fuel during a storm with 70 mph winds, not to mention there were other pumps open. The employee was just being mean spirited — I always thought you were supposed to be kind during times of crisis. I won’t be using any of there services any longer. Too bad because I always try to support small businesses.; Buchanan's service center was great. If they can get you in and out same day they will. Barring complications and depending how busy they are. I highly recommend. Good job guys."

James didn't give up on a tough situation with our older vehicle, he worked many hours to solve the problem so that we could make it home safely. The owner John, George and Chelsey at the front desk were all great too. Prices very fair for work done. Honest, salt of the earth folks. Recommended to us by locals in town as well. Highly recommend. :); My AC died part way through a 16 hour road trip and they had me back out on the road within an hour. I really appreciate it! The lobby was nice and cool (very nice after driving a few hours with no AC), and they had drinks to purchase in the lobby. Everyone was very nice and they kept you updated through the process.; My water pump on my Cummins diesel locked up and stranded me on 95 3 miles from this repair shop.  I called and they said they could fix it that day and I was told their tow truck would be there in 1 hour.  Two and a half hours later the tow truck showed up.  After dropping off the truck I waited another 2 hours for their ""diagnostics"". They came back with over $1200 for a water pump, serpentine belt and thermostat and it won't be fixed until tomorrow.

I ended up limping my truck directly across the street to the Napa auto parts store and changed the water pump myself in the parking lot(literally only needed a Phillips screwdriver, breaker bar(for the belt tensioner) and a 10mm socket for the 2 water pump bolts.   Cost me $79 for the water pump plus a jug of antifreeze and two gallons of distilled water from the dollar general next door and was on the road in less than 30 minutes. Drove another 700 miles north to New York then a week later 1000 miles back to Florida.

They saw my Florida license plate and saw dollar signs. This shop preys on out of towners. They tried to get my money and failed but they successfully wasted many hours of my time.; Had a flat on 95, i put the spare on and found Butlers right off the interstate.  The gentleman stopped what he was doing and quickly fixed our tire and put it back on for us. Excellent service,  friendly employee,  i wish i could remember his name. Highly recommend this garage for any services they provide.; I brought my wheels in to get two tires mounted on them. After three hours of waiting for them to mount two tires on them there are scratches and a huge gash on the lip of my wheel. Owner claims that that did not happen but the damages were not there before owner also claims that they were the one working on the tire when another one of their employees brought it out to me telling me that they worked on it. 10 out of 10 would never recommend anyone to ever go to the shop. The wall also states that the customers matter and care about quality. Obviously not after the owner hung up on our phone call trying to resolve the issue I had after using their service. Lazy people do not recommend….. experience summarized (told off to go take my wheels off, brought them back off of the car, waited 3 hours after I was told that it would only take a minute, got my wheels damaged by them, rudely told off by one of the owners/managers that they “didn’t scratch it” and they hung up on me) very professional………."

Very professional and great work! Thanks to Ron for setting me up with a fresh set of OZ’s! He made the process smooth and quick! I recommend Stokes to anyone needing tire and wheel services!; Replaced both sets of tires on my Teslas here.

After my first experience at Stokes, I was impressed with speed, efficiency and communication from everyone at Stokes.

When it was time to change tires on the model Y, I thought of Stokes first and got it done promptly with the same amazing service.

Highly recommended, they’ve been in business for 47 years and once you’ve been here, you’ll know why.; I have driven by this tire shop numerous times. Very recently I noticed my tire and braking was acting very loud and wonky.   Upon looking at my car I noticed 2 lug nuts were missing... Ack!

I carefully drove to Stokes Tire Service.  I got there right away in the morning.  They took care of my car and fixed my tire, ensuring it was clean and properly torqued.

Pricing was more than I was assuming it would cost. Sure, if I could have hobbled my car to the east side, I probably could have had it done for 1/4 of the price.  But I feel that they did an exceptional job. Went above and beyond. And instead of hoping the job will work, I know it is fixed.   That peace of mind is worth it.

Very easy access off Santa Monica Blvd.  Great waiting room.  Very popular place and for good reason.  Thanks for fixing my ride!; Great service, fair, honest and very knowledgeable. I brought my Toyota Tacoma in for a wheel alignment because the Toyota dealership didn't want to do it. Scheduling an appointment was easy, even though they were very busy. When I arrived I was helped right away. The tech lifted my truck, saw the front suspension was pretty rusty and called me over to explain. He squirted some penetrating oil on all the fittings and said it would need to soak in, and to come back in a couple of weeks. Then handed my keys back to me and said have a nice day. I asked inside and they wouldn't even let me pay for the mechanic's time. Great attitude, and from the look of things, lots of really happy customers. I know now why my service advisor at the dealership said to come here; I had a nail in my tire that they repaired without an appointment, in one hour. They were very professional and efficient. Highly recommend. Thank you Stokes!"

I had a hell of an afternoon and got a flat tire on the 405. Called this shop from the tow truck and they were super friendly and fit me right in. My car was ready in under an hour. The price was fair and they didn’t try to up-sell.; Ive been coming here awhile, I just so appreciate that they don’t try to create fake urgency around certain car issues that can wait to get fixed. If it’s actually urgent they’ll let you know. Trevor was really patient and explained a lot of stuff about my car to me, including giving me an honest time line on when I should try to get things repaired by and helped me out with my car. The other mechanic was nice too and explained why my car was making noises. Every time I come here, no matter who helps me (last time I think it was Mike) I learn a lot about my car and I really appreciate that. The dealership wanted 200 dollars just for a diagnostic, which these guys did for free and educated me on the issue. I never feel like I’m getting swindled. I highly recommend this place.; These guys are always great no matter what the issue.  They also are busy but find a way to fit me in and do fantatsic work for a great price.  Thank you as always!; Can't express my appreciation of these guys strongly enough. Our car's air conditioner failed on a scorching trip from Arizona. Mike and his guys were compassionate, competent, fast and totally fair to a couple of random out-of-towners. Bravo, guys! And thank you.; I had an incredibly disappointing experience at Pacific Coast Tire & Service in Santa Monica. I came in expecting to purchase new tires, but what I got were clearly used tires passed off as new. Despite the staff's assurances, it was obvious that these tires were not new. They had significant wear and tear, and their performance has been subpar from the start.

Not only did they deceive me about the condition of the tires, but they also charged me full price for what should have been new tires. This kind of dishonesty is unacceptable, and I feel completely ripped off. The lack of integrity and customer service here is astounding.

I would strongly advise anyone considering this shop to look elsewhere. It's not worth the risk of being taken advantage of by their misleading practices. Save yourself the hassle and find a more reputable place to take care of your tire needs."

There are never enough cashiers to service the customers and they have a nerve to close down the rear check out station every time! The District Manager isn’t doing their job or maybe they don’t care 🤷‍♀️; Not sure if they are understaffed or over worked, but the pharmacy is just bad. Calling with questions about a new prescription is always a hassle and the Pharmacist and their staff are always very short, verging on rude. Definitely going to need to take my business elsewhere."

But what about the bathrooms? Well, they were very clean and smelled good.
Drinks. well, they have this machines that I really like. It grinds your coffee fresh.. it smells good! The Dark coffee is my favorite. As I walked outside a man was pressure washing the parking lot and gas station bay.

A lady was listening. She followed me out and said I appreciate  you mentioned that ..it is awful; Terrible experience. The lady’s on shift are so unprofessional.Came out of the store yelling and saying profanity and offensive language. Would not recommend if I could rate this Circle K lower than a 1 star I would.

Seriously so unprofessional.👎; Never seen such a new store be in such bad shape. Literally 60% of the pumps are bagged out of order. Half of the windshield washers are gone and none have paper towels. Bring back the old kangaroo!!! This place needs new management or something.; This place is ridiculous it's crazy how for the past 3 weeks now The only way you're able to get anything from them is if you have cash they have the signs posted on the door and at the checkout register and they seem to not even care that they have a reduction in customers I've never seen a situation where a system is down for over 3 weeks. If you're an Indian Trail do yourself a favor and go to the QT a mile and a half up the road at least there they'll take your debit/creditcard and you can also get free ice 👍; Excellent Selection. Unorganized but great variety. The beer selection especially. The reason I took off a star is that it's absolutely packed right now on a Sunday night and had 8 people in front of me, took a long time to get to the register just to learn the cc machine is broken/slow. Wouldn't accept my chip card. If this place wants to get return customers they need to hire and also repair their cc card system and pump issues. Would have been 3 stars but they just opened so I'll give them some benefit of the doubt"

Clean bathrooms. They let us the microwave for free. They have a wide range of products.; If zero stars were possible, that's what my review would be. This place was absolutely horrible. We got coffee that was lukewarm and when we told the employees that they needed to make a fresh pot since we bought the last of the coffee, they just put an out of order sign on the pot. This was at 10:15pm. We did however get the slushie machine fixed by the employees to get a slushie, and then they put an out of order sign on that too. Sounds like they need to get employees that actually want to work. As we drove down the road, the coffee was undrinkable, the slushie was downright nasty, and we ended up throwing them all out. To top it all off, this place had the highest gas prices we stopped at in our entire trip. I hope people see this review and avoid this place.; On a road trip home, my family and I were broke down  due to a bad sensor, and we were stuck at the station as we waited for help. The employees were incredibly kind, empathetic, and accommodating!  They made a stressful situation so much better.

We were also impressed by the rest of the  staff, clean gas station in general, and yummy food. If we are ever back  through, we will stop by again for sure! Thank you!"

I have been nothing but polite & nice to her every single time & it changes nothing. She even has an attitude when she ask for an ID (I am 33) that i literally have in my hand waiting to hand to her. But I see it must not be personal as others have made complaints before me about the black hair & blue eyeshadow girl. Every other person that works there is amazing & I can’t imagine how she must treat them if she treats the customers the way she does.

I live near by so it’s a frequented store for me and she continuously gives attitude and tries to do the bare minimum when it comes to customer service. I tried to buy a piece of candy for my grandmother today on my way to see her and this employee told me that I would have to spend more and that she would not break a 20 dollar bill just for a small piece of candy. She told me “it is not her job to give change, and that if I wanted to use a 20 dollar bill I would have to spend more of it.” To be turned away simply because I wanted to use cash here at a convenience store Is highly disappointing and the polar opposite of convenient. Spoken to numerous others who have also had problems with this employee. As someone with management experience, I would personally never let such a person have such a negative impact on the customers that come in to the store on a daily basis. If you plan to shop here, be ready for bad attitude, disrespect, and for her to talk about you badly behind your back to others in the store once you leave. (I came back inside and heard her talking crap to the next person in line about our not so good experience; Everything was good except the pump was malfunctioning, so I had to go inside to pay. Just ran in quick to grab a diet coke. Leaving 4 ⭐️ didn't have time to talk or inspect, but everything seemed the same, so that's good.; Probably one of the cleaner and most organized Speedways out there. The bathroom was very clean and stocked. Was very happy with the gas price and of course the rewards are great. Love the amount of space between pumps. Easily can be used for boats trailers and trucks.; This is an amazing speedway with an extremely experienced and talented staff. I honestly love the staff, Diane has always been so nice to me, she truly is an amazing human being and needs a raise immediately. As for Brittany commonly known on the review thread as (girl with blue eye shadow and black hair) I come in about 4 out of every 7 days a week, today I couldn’t help myself.

I am not local and I was just passing thru the area 😡 I can't drive back.; Came by doors where closed and it’s supposedly 24/7 she was talking on the phone and ignored us from the outside claiming in was closed either she’s not a good employee or the owner of the store needs to update their hours!!! 07-08-2024 (11:09pm) terrible service!; Not 24/7 at all.
If you get there before 10pm they might be open.
Hope this helps.; First time visiting this gas station /convenient store. Customer friendly,  store has a variety of items to fit your needs. Gas prices are starting at $3.00 when looking for regular gas at this Speedway. This Speedway is a pretty decent size a has enough pumps to accommodate drivers. I would recommend."

Absolutely love the variety of choices to be comfortable as a truck driver... Fellas they even hair a barber for those touch ups etc 🤭😁...; How fun!🤩 Soon as we walked in we thought wow this reminds us of Iowa-80 & found out it is a part of the Iowa-80 truck stop! Just a bit smaller. Everything you can think of from clothing to a mound of toys, souvenirs, leather boots/jackets, too much to list! We were actually jumping off freeway to hit the Loves, so glad we happened to see this! We never knew about this stop! Food court. & probably don’t need to tell ya that the store & bathrooms were clean! Helpful & Friendly personnel! My husband got a leather jacket, real nice! Not too bad on the prices considering it’s a huge travel/driver stop off! Truck lounge, barber, free parking. Great showroom! So many supplies & add ons for our trucks! BTW? If you’re walking in with the lil ones? Be prepared for them to go crazy with all the cool toys lol!; Joplin 44 was sooo cool!  These pix were taken inside the women's restroom.  One was taken inside Iron Skillet restaurant...

They have nearly EVERYTHING for your semi... and I mean, EVERYTHING!

We got our sun shades there for our windows...they r a GOD SEND!  They protect u from the sun beating down on u!  Well worth the $$ ($20 or less).

We stayed there overnight,  & there was PLENTY of parking (EVEN HANDICAPPED ♿️ parking...I think there r @ least 4 or more!).; This is one of my favorite truck stops it has many services for truck drivers, including haircare, lots of free parking, a great showroom view, and lots of souvenirs. The employees were nice and the restaurant was open all night.  We enjoyed 1 am. French toast and steak for breakfast at the iorn skillet. They have lots of food choices and a wonderful coffee shop. This place is pet friendly, which is a plus for my little dog. Overall, a Truckers' dream truck stops and fun experience. Definitely stop here next time you are in Joplin, Missouri. This is the sister truck stop to the Iowa 80 world's largest truck stop.; Pretty much every drink i picked up was expired. Not even by a couple days, all of it was weeks.

I was having trouble outside and she came outside to help me. She was really sweet and very caring and the store was wonderful. It was beautiful. It was clean. Her customer service skills was excellent, out of every place I’ve ever been. I’ll give this place 100. Keep up the good work we need more people and places like this; I regularly stopped here in the past on a weekly basis. I came through today, and while individuals in here are typically nice, this lady felt it necessary to be rude to my face and tell me to go around all the way to the other isle to come back down 2 feet From where I was standing to get a pack of trail mix. The lady told me she was “ Stocking shelves” and purposely block The from that point forward. I reported her to the manager, but the whole store seemed lackluster in performance.

I will gladly stop at the Love’s Truck stop Across the interstate from now on.; I stopped by this location on 10/04/2024 to use the Transflo and it was doing some kind of update so I couldn't use it. I would like to thank the lady that works at the Flying J for taking the time out to take care of the problem. She was so patient and kind and I really appreciate it. I was in a hurry to make a delivery and I wasn't trying to stick around. She asked me if I could just give it a second and I was like no I have to get going. I step away for a second and when I come back she was still at the Transflo machine and had actually took care of the issue and I got to scan my paperwork. I really appreciate someone like her. She just didn't walk off and say screw this machine. Because I did stop her when she was on her way to take care of something. Now that's a really, really nice Flying J employee. Thanks.; 8/29/21 The ladies are really sweet and nice. I didn’t have not one problem. Stores looks really good. Plenty of hot food to choose from. Fresh coffee. I even had a great waiter in Denny’s (Jessica ). She was attentive even with having  a few other tables and running the register. She’s the G.O.A.T. This store didn’t miss a beat. They were speaking to literally every customer that walked in and offered help. I didn’t see anyone looking down on their phones. This is how a travel center should be. Oh the shower, I’ve never seen a shower as clean as theirs. I didn’t find any hair or nail clippings, the toilet was super clean. The soap was filled. The water was 🔥. I really like this store. Great job everyone at this location. Keep up the great work!"

They're nearly always good for a clean restroom and today was no exception.

Stopping here, I was able to put some fuel in the Sprinter and while it was pumping, the long stick squeegee reached the top of my windshield to clean off all the bugs. No trash in the pump area and a nice high roof I could easily fit under.

Inside, plenty of snacks and drinks plus the usual hot dog roller grill with a variety of tube-shaped meats ready to go. Coffee station was tidy and stocked with creamer and sweeteners. I scanned my barcode at the register to earn credit towards that free coffee!

Restroom was clean and I like that they have the green/yellow/red buttons so that you can provide instant anonymous feedback. It was ""green"" today.; The Loves has large clean showers, soft towels that smell good and a cheerful staff. I appreciate locations like this one that are well cared after.; Update⚠️ I used laundry facilities: Not a good experience! There’s 3 dryers/2 washers. One dryer was out of order. 1st load done I transferred to dryer- & it didn’t work just ate money. Waited 20 mins for someone to check it out. Then had problems with 3rd dryer, waiting yet again for someone to come smh.

Never really had a complaint until now. Overall,  things are well stocked, general cleanliness is good,  and the staff has been very friendly. So I'm only giving it one star lower because of the fan in the shower room.  You can clean the shower room all you want,  but eventually,  that fan will need a cleaning too.  I've seen small chunks of the muck gathered on the fan fly off while it's running. The fan is festively decorated with streamers,  twirling and flopping in the air as the fan runs. Oh, wait a minute.  That's people hair,  not streamers! If they leave it,  after a while, you won't even feel air blowing in front of it.  I've experienced that at a Pilot shower in Gary,  IN years ago. I'll be letting management know about the fan.  And I'm sure they will rectify the problem.; Stopped by this gas station for a fill up and a driving break. They have the usual fuels you would expect to find like unleaded and diesel. The price is comparable to other stations in the area. The store has hot foods, cold foods, drinks, snacks, and other merchandise. There is an Arby's attached, if you want fast food.

Took off 1 star because they don't have any of the newer fuels like flex fuel or electric charging stations. The merchandise inside can be overpriced but it's a part of the convenience.; Take a moment to consider the sacrifices truckers make. They leave behind families, friends, and special occasions to bring food to your table, clothes for your back, and essential goods like wood and cars. Truckers are no less important than the army; while the army protects, truckers keep us alive and happy. Tragically, they often sacrifice their families, love, and relationships to keep the world and America moving. Despite this, they don’t receive the respect they deserve.

Look at these pictures. Many of us wouldn’t think of sleeping without our families, yet truckers do so every day. Some drivers have lost their lives in accidents or passed away in their truck cabs.

Please, respect truckers.

A heartfelt thanks to Love’s Gas Station and their staff, who are always there for truckers, providing everything they need.; As far as gas stations go, this is a good one, price was expected and the convenience store stocked full of snacks. Checkout was quick and the restrooms clean. Can’t ask for much more.; I had some time to kill so I thought I’d get my oil changed. I was told by the first tech about 1 hour wait. Checked back in about 2.5 hours in with the manager that was in the shop and he advised 1 more hour wait and they’ll be calling me. It’s been a week and they still haven’t called. That shop is a joke. Hey “loves” I took my money else where and will never go back to a Loves. By reading the reviews it looks like this is a regular practice here. Someone needs to be fired.

Not only was she incredibly helpful and attentive, but she also went above and beyond by finding my keys in the bathroom after cleaning it. She kept them safe until I returned, which was a huge relief. Brittney is truly a life saver, and I really appreciate her dedication and kindness. Thank you, Brittney! Also I had a great experience at Chester’s thanks to Demetrius. He’s a hard worker and gave me the exact time to come back when the chicken would be ready. I also overheard him mentioning that he changed the grease and made fresh grease, which shows his dedication to quality. His customer service was excellent, and I really appreciate his efforts. Thanks, Demetrius!; Clean showers and restrooms plus it’s plenty of available truck parking, they have a subway restaurant inside and it’s right off interstate 65 just south of Montgomery.; This review is pointed at the Chester’s/Godfathers Pizza/Subway located inside the Love’s. Horrible, horrible, horrible. First, the food was lackluster to say the least (I had Chester’s). The mashed potatoes were Tasteless. No flavor whatsoever. Here are the biggest problems. 1. NO napkins in the dispenser next to the soda machine. 2. This is the big one:  The main/larger dining area was completely closed off leaving only 4 small booths for folks to sit and eat.  AT 6:00 pm!!!  Apparently the employees there decided to close off the area because they’re TOO LAZY TO CLEAN IT AGAIN! While I was attempting to eat my meal (notice I didn’t say ‘enjoy’), a lady who I did not know parked herself at my table to wait for her food to be completed. I will never go there again. I’ll go to the Flying J across the road instead and eat at Denny’s. At least there I can be assured of ample seating.  Avoid this place!!!’n; Maybe this was their bad day. They said there were only 3 workers this evening. Two were at regular front entrance, and the other was cleaning showers. No one was working the fuel desk at all because he was cleaning showers. The smart option would've been to have 2 at the fuel desk and one at v the front entrance. One could've cleaned showers while the other took care of the fuel desk. If needed, consumers could've had the option to check out at 2 desks instead of only 1. I waited forever to get my CAT scale ticket.

Please have 2 at the fuel desk instead of one because the suggestion I made above makes more sense than how the employees were positioned in the travel center.; I would offer that this Loves is good. I have stopped here a few times while on I-65. Typical Loves experience. Staff are friendly and food/drinks are the same as most Loves. This location seems to be a bit smaller footprint, but still was able to get fuel and snacks without a wait."

The sign is extra large, which makes it very iconic.  It is at a very busy intersection, so it can be hard to get in and out of this place.  This place usually doesn't have the best prices on gas, but if you are low on gas, this is a good place to go.; Go anywhere else besides here. This gas station is a joke. Their car wash will take your money, say “Error printing receipt - Please see attendant” and then not work. No big deal, I’ll just go see the attendant and get my money back, right? Wrong. The attendant supposedly has no way of providing you with a receipt. And no way of refunding your money. Weird how last time this happened I was actually refunded immediately; that girl must just be stealing from the company I guess. Don’t use this car wash. Don’t use this gas station. Gas is always more expensive here anyways.; This is a review of the mechanics (service dept). This is your basic neighborhood car repair shop from a bygone era. I have been bringing my cars here for 20 years now, Including foreign cars and a Mercedes that most people would take to a dealership. They always get us in quickly, do a great job and are scrupulously honest.  I trust them completely, knowing that they will not run the bill up and will let me know if there’s something that they can’t handle. I recommend them 100%, except I’d almost prefer for them to remain a well-kept secret so that they can still get me in right away! On top of it all, you get a free car wash with any service.; Says closed on Sunday but they were open and a 12 OZ REDBULL was $5.80 other places $5.69 for 2 12 oz redbull 😅; If you need a state inspection they're great. And if you live in the area, very convenient. But if you need someone to really troubleshoot a problem with your car, go elsewhere. They just had my older truck for over a week...it died on me. They told me it was electronic and they couldn't fix it. So I had to have it towed to my house. Then spent hours trying to find someone to troubleshoot electronics. I finally found a shop. Had it towed there. They called the next day and said it was the FUEL PUMP!  This is AFTER I specifically asked the Amoco shop if they checked that because I thought it was a fuel issue.

I won't get into the details about the screwed up alignment that Telle ended up fixing.

And my neighbor who asked them to fix a rough running car. They said there's nothing wrong with it...just put in premium fuel.  The second opinion shop found a bad spark plug and gave it a tune up. Now its perfect.

Lazy? Inept? Don't care? Completely lost my trust for anything beyond the basics (even though a fuel pump is pretty basic in itself)."

The first time was a Friday night and the second was today,  a Sunday afternoon.  Both times I had the same cashier. I had several item and as I was trying to set them on the counter she said $14.16. I still had things under my arm and I asked if she got those. She said $14.16. Again,  I asked if she saw everything.  Again she stated the price. I said, I heard you. Did you get everything.  She pushed a bag out the window and that was it.
Today, I have 4 items. She kept telling me to turn the barcode to her. I was trying.  She wouldn't make eye contact.  I asked her if she had worked there long. She said yes, then wagged her finger at me and told me not to judge people because you don't know what they're going through.  I agreed. If she hates her job THAT much, maybe it's time for a career change. One that doesn't involve people. Human interaction is not her thing. She looks miserable.  I wasn't judging her, I was trying to make conversation.  Maybe stocking the cooler or a work from home job is more her forte.; The place is clean, and the staff was friendly enough. The thing that bothers me about them is that I was just sold pork skins that are 25 days past the expiration date.; This place DOES NOT EXIST!; Nice and clean🥰"

It helps that it’s right across the street from where I recently moved. Gas prices are great! I remember coming to this gas station after the hurricane (before it was remodeled) because it was one of the only places to find gas and the lines were not too long. In several occasions, I traveled all the way from Aguada/Rincon to find gas when I couldn’t find any near my home. There is also an area out back with a beautiful view of Desecheo where it appears that many locals enjoy a cold beverage after a hot day! I haven’t ventured back there yet but it appears to be a hidden treasure! They always have local fresh baked goodies for sale. I only wish they were open later!; Nice COLD air conditioning, gobs of alcoholic beverages; namely foreign and domestic beers. You'll find the usual snacks; salted and sweet. I entered and left quickly, grabbed what I went in for and didn't take the time to look around more. The cash register area is sealed off by glass, you don't have to worry about being exposed to the employee, and vice versa. But, at the same time, I didn't see a temp taker machine or spray sanitizer. Not sure if I was just in too much of a hurry to take a moment to check, and do the required, I don't venture out much. Anyway, clean place, with your standard four gas pumps. I hear the food truck in back cooks great grub.; New Owners have transformed this gas station in a great place! I live close from it and I can find anything I want no matter the time.

When I went in couldn't believe the variety of beers, local, US and International. I was in a rush, but I grabbed a Fat Tire, Belgium Amber Ale. I am definitely going back to check it out thoroughly. They have plenty of pumps and it is very spacious. That have a variety of other goods, like snacks, other food items, phone gear, wines, sodas and other drinks. They even have a Gapos just outside the gas station with comfortable seating to eat in.; Great place to pick up some drinks and drink under the stars. Has music, has a convenience store, and you can buy gas for your car. It has a Sandwich place withing 30 paces, so you can eat as well.

I jusy want to fill the damn tank, I shouldn't need to guess.  And so much for pay at the pump convenience if you have to go inside anyway, why have card readers at all?  Ridiculous,  but that's cool, other way better fuel stations will get my money.; No RV specific filling or parking, but fairly easy in and out on truck side of lot.

I pumped my gas & went on my way. I didn't know the danger I was in until I stopped by my parents house. As soon as I walked in the house my parents advised me that I smelled of gasoline really bad. I knew that I hadn't spilled any on me & that the pump wasn't leaking. I noticed my pant legs were wet in the back which I chalked up to the rain but it wasn't rain at all. I had apparently stepped in enough gasoline for it to be all over the bottoms of my pant legs & the backs of my shoes. This was so dangerous for me because I can't smell things like most people I can & I smoke. I immediately changed my clothes & attempted to call the gas station several times to make them aware of the situation but the number they have listed everywhere goes to a cellphone with no ability to leave a message. I called Midwest Corporate & they don't have a correct number either. My fear is that a small child will get into this gasoline thinking it is a water puddle. I can't stress this enough but businesses need to have a phone number listed that people can call & employees need to answer said phone.; The workers need to find a different job because it's obvious they hate the one they got.

The first time I went in to get some gizzard.
They looked like they had been sitting there for quite some time.
I asked how long they had been out and the girl replied ""oh about 1 1/2 hours"". I asked if she knew the shelf life on them and she said, ""what's that"". 😳
So after I talked for a minute, they fried some up and I waited for them.
I got home and sat down to eat and they were SOOOOO salty that I couldn't eat them. So, thinking it was a fluke thing. I threw them out.
That was my first visit.
I decided to try it again.
So my 2nd visit they had no gizzards in the warmer. Said they had to make some and it would take about 10-15 minutes.
I waited and shopped around the store.
Under the assumption they were freshly fried, I headed home.
I got home and sat down to eat, thinking they were gonna be too hot to take a big bite, I took a little bite.....they were barely warm and again soon salty I couldn't eat them.
My theory is they had that pan in the back ready to toss the ild gizzardsand since they were down to one fryer and said it would take about 15 minutes since they had something else in the fryer, they gave me the food they were probably going to toss. They weren't fit to eat.
For future reference, I would ask for a sample of the gizzrds to make sure they're not tough and too salty to eat.
I would check the chicken, too.
The breading is waaaayyyy to salty, especially for ppl that may have high BP. That would shoot it through the roof.
I personally won't be going back there.
I also stood and witnessed so eone making pizza without gloves and when someone walked up to the ccounter, she wiped her hands on her jeans,  after helping the customer, didn't wash her hands and went right back to making pizzas. SMH. How unsanitary is that....?
I've been in restaurant management and this place, really, really needs some help.
Dissatisfied & concerned.; Your service can really vary here depending on which staff you have to deal with, which isn't fair to be honest. The kitchen manager is a delight! Some staff seem to sit certain things down early out of pure laziness, where as others seem as though they wouldn't know how to complete much of anything. Bathrooms are usually pretty gross so consider this your warning.... Good luck; Not a good place to work poor poor management..overpriced average food...points don't add up for all the overpriced items..hucks corporate off8ce ain't no better u write multiple grievances with no response..if I could give negative stars I would"

Got rib sandwich, the bun was dry and it was way over priced as well. Gas was over priced too.  I like Costco for gas and Kwik Trip for rib sandwiches.  Holiday is better than Speedway.; Ive always had weird or bad experiences at this location. Doesn't seem like the employees are communicating well with each other. A lot of the workers look very un happy. No one smiles, no pleasant greetings , just rude and dry environment.  Today i spent 20 on snacks and drinks and was told i was stealing because i refused to pay for the ice. I watched a man throw 2 plastic cups away in front of two employees and no charged was given to him for wasting 2 cups . but i have to pay 50 cents for ice or im a thief. That's so rude and unprofessional. When i told the ""manager"" about this he said very rudely and very unprofessionally that that's company policy and it didn't matter if someone threw away multiple cups , that I'm stealing if i get ice. Its the ice that cost money.
- no its not. its the plastic that cost money, and your thought process is backwards.
The same guy  was bullying the older woman . making her take the trash out as his young and able body self put hot dogs on the roller and watched her struggle. That was a very wild scene. the cashier was also a young and able body and yet the old lady was being forced to take the trash out. she even said "" oh wow, its been such a long time since ive taken the trash out"" like she was equally concerned. There is no courtesy to guest and no courtesy from employee to employee.  I go to holiday regularly. I never have issues outside of this location. someone needs to look into the management at this location because its obvious something is off.; Had to pee. Got a burger & snacks. Clean place.

I'm not sure if it's intentional or not but I don't go here unless I absolutely need to. I've visited here multiple times within last yr. I always feel uncomfortable. (Edit to add after reading a few other reviews it seems like most minorities feel uncomfortable inside of this store)
The store always seems dingy and gloomy. I never order food there so can't speak on it. It's not a place I'd order food from..I only get factory sealed items.

BUT, when you scan your Love's barcode, you get ten cents off per gallon and that will almost always make Love's the cheapest fuel.

They have a Wendy's and a Subway if either of those appeal to you. And they have a small dog park.; Excellent fuel prices, friendly “Welcome to Love’s” service from employees who care, clean bathrooms and available trucker showers, and some of the best fuel prices along the I-70 between Indianapolis and Columbus.

Dave pulled in around 6 a.m. and while I hated to bother him even before he made it into the store, his disposition on the matter was truly refreshing.

Instead of him treating me like an annoying customer, he treated me like a valued one.

This is not a common occurrence when visiting a Love's and if I've said it before Love's, I'll say it again, THESE are the kinds of team members you should be keeping and discarding the rest if they don't want to straighten up their nasty attitudes!

Dave, Reagan, and Gregg, even had to wake up four drivers blocking the bay exits just so I could get out when they were done. Two drivers moved right away but the other two idiots, took their time even though their were plenty of spots open so the guys had to visit those same idiots on three separate occasions.

There aren't a lot of Love's employees that'll go out of their way for you and these three guys were my unsung hero's this day!!

Thank you for being a Blessing to me guys, may it come back to you a hundred fold!!!; I got here 1420. I took my dog out for a walk and found someone had dumped several boxes of most likely chicken in them from Tyson. I went in and told a manager about it. It is now 8:20 pm. Nothing has been done.

HOWEVER the kid in the tire shop is why I'm giving a 2 (really 1.5). Pulled in at 12:30 AM to gave 2 trailer tires removed and put our spares on. 2.5 hours later he had 1 (ONE) tire removed. 3 hours later he had 1 tire remounted, I noticed the security cameras and thought the morning crew was coming on shift,  it took him about 3 minutes to get the second tire on. We pulled out of the shop at 5:15 AM He knew we were unhappy, he took his break at some point and I hollered (hey) into the shop to see where he was. The only saving grace was he didn't charge us."

I would say that I think whoever manages this store should maybe think about a different way.

Soda machine has been failing over the past 6 months and continually has at least one or two signs for no product. Cold case is rarely stocked or faced. Pizza tends to be a good deal and probably the only hot food item I'd recommend. Skip the hot dogs, often they'll be on well past their edibility.

I could go on but if you skip the fountain soda and hot food minus the pizza then it'll pass for a gas station visit.

If you are stopping after a long drive I'd really recommend stopping at the Holiday or Kwik Trip nearby.

Bathrooms have been decent but the store definitely doesn't have cleaning done regularly on much of anything.

Poorly run Speedway and will update my review if I see changes.; Inattentive staff, the men's restroom was out of order and men were not permitted to use the women's restroom. Almost half of the pricing labels were missing, half of the drinks were out of order for both the slurpee and fountain machines and the seals on the refrigerator were peeling off. Not a store I would recommend.; This literally deserves no stars. We came 1400 miles south from Texas. Stayed stranded not even a mile out from the store so a State trooper helped us. Once we got into the store the cashier was so rude, didn't want us there. Went on slamming doors and calling someone to tell them we were there and we couldn't be there. Not once offered anything even after seeing us freezing. Tried to explain to her we are not from the area and we were looking for a Lyft to leave. We did not want to be of inconvenience. Another customer saw and over heard her and began to help us. Told us we can be in the store and asked the cashier for her manager. Cashier ended up calling police on the lady and flipped the whole story. She was not trying to help, she was very mad at us being there. -11 weather out and she just wanted us out. Speed way y'all need to give that customer the best treatment and a reward for standing up for other customers. Police should not be called on customers who speak up for others. That lady was an angel and the cashier, I will hope karma does not come back to you.; Do not go here! The pumps don’t work and said pay inside. I canceled the transaction and drove off. Then later found someone trying to charge my card for $126 at this same gas station. Stay away from here unless you want to get scammed; The pumps take forever and you always have to pay inside because the card readers never work. The employees are even more trash. Drive down the street to bp instead.

They say they want to look into it and help but don’t care at all lol don’t fall for their responses."

Needed help with the bike once and the guy behind the counter was happy to help.  Much appreciated, buddy! 🤘🏽 Attitude there is always fun no matter who's behind the counter.
*Quarters are appreciated there.  (I gotchu girl!); I have been coming to the Eastwood James St. Mobil Gas Station for about 25 years, or more. This is the only gas station in our neighborhood. It is heartbreaking to see that it has not been maintained, kept clean, functioning, and safe, in such a long time.

Why is that??? Does anyone know? It's not like they don't get business anymore? Who owns this place? Come on, buddy! You are slipping here. Not cool.

They do have some gorgeous flowers in front. Have you seen those? Whoever is in charge of that, has done an incredible job!! Thank you!!

The employees that work at this Mobil are all wonderful people. I do have to give that to them. I've enjoyed seeing each of them over the years.

I have been avoiding this gas station lately, because...

...there is only ONE gas pump left that actually prints out receipts!

I never use cash anymore. Only credit cards. It is not always safe to run to the store to grab your receipt. That's how women get their purses stolen, etc. No thanks. I'd rather stay safe and out of trouble. Thanks. Even if that means driving a little farther. It's too bad, though. It would be nice to feel safe and confident in my own neighborhood again. You know? (Who's with me?)

If the Owner of the Eastwood Mobil (Or Staff: if you could pass this on to the owner?) is reading this...
PLEASE...
Fix your pumps!!!
Clean up your station!
We care about this neighborhood!
Thank you!!

Edit: Thank you for updating and cleaning up the Eastwood Mobil Station! We appreciate it 😊!"

There are a number of gas pumps available, so I've never had to wait for one to open up. There's never any trash blowing around, none of the pumps are gross or dirty (there are trash cans next to every pump, which is super convenient), and I've never had the inconvenience of pulling up, shutting off my car, getting out my cards then walking around to the pump to find out it's closed/broken.; She's a bit rough around the edges now, with a rundown feel at the pumps, but still convenient on the main drag to fill up on the go. The aging infrastructure still works, just not spiffy.; Anytime I go to bring my fiancé to work and stop to get him drinks , theirs 2 clerks working that are super rude .

Nice location. Plenty of food selection in walking distance, biggest issue is they have two washers and 4 dryers.... Funny enough, the washing machine they use to wash their towels was broken, so the employee was washing them in one of the two washers they had available. I suspected they didn't use soap to wash their towels. And watching the employee wash Them has confirmed that they do not use soap to wash their towels. They just go through a water cycle. Which is why I always bring my own towel to these truck stops.; A difficult spot to access. If you are coming off 40 eastbound you have to make an unprotected left off the ramp, then another at a light and then finally a left uphill into a very cramped filling area into this Loves. Westbound you just miss that first left. Exiting is difficult as well since trucks leaving from uphill on the access road backup past the auto exit and entrance waiting on the light or traffic to go back to the interstate. The store itself was fine, the bathrooms were clean, the soda cold. It was busy so some fresh items seemed out of stock and the checkout a little long but the employees were making good efforts. As per usual the Subway in the middle is a walkthrough with one person working and a much busier McDonald's on the end. This McDonald's seems to attract local traffic though, exacerbating the traffic problems. Overall given there are several good gas options on nearby exits this would probably not be a recommended exit or stop for me if I could help it.; My truck brake chamber went out while I was backing into a parking space here at love’s and barely made it in.
I went to their shop to buy a brake chamber I showed them pictures and part # for what I need and they told me they don’t have it and it was Saturday ( nowhere els to go ).
And then when I told him that they can go ahead and replace it , now they have the brake chamber that I was trying to get. Took them 4 hours to replace it and I was charged $433.81 for that.
And I drove my truck for about 40 mins Sunday morning when a lady was waving at me on the road to tell me that my truck is on fire I stopped right away and there was a lot of smoke coming out that same exact wheel they messed with.
Drivers on the road called 911 and reported a fire as the police officer told me when he showed up to my spot on the road shoulder.
I backed off the brake shoes all the way off the brake drum and drove to safe location.
And later on when I took the wheel and brake drum off my truck I found a mess it looks like they used a hammer to put brake shoes back on the truck and some brake components  were hanging some others were siting inside the bottom brake shoe as you will see in pictures.; I love Loves Travel Stop! Anyone with me when I travel gets a little aggravated (angry) because I try to stop at every Loves that we come to. And I’ll not buy something needed at one just to have an excuse to stop at another. If you haven’t stopped at one yet then trust me when I say THEN GO STOP AT ALL OF THEM! I promise you that the prices are amazing. And they have items and gadgets for truckers, travelers, phone chargers, food, drinks, snacks, CB radios, backup cameras, throws, jackets, shirts, novelty items, clean restrooms, friendly helpful staff, low gas prices, novelty items, and ETC. I post a lot of reviews and if I see anything wrong I post it also but who ever had the idea to open this place put a lot of thought and effort into being as close to perfect as anyone could want; The lady inside the tire office isn’t doing her job. I went inside to get answer to my questions. I said hello nobody respond back. After 5 minutes I asked again who do I need to speak? Lady answered me with an attitude and telling me I’m fixing a ticket and with a tone she said wait like I’m her child. I said to myself ok let me wait a little more. Then she started to chat with her coworker and laugh. And I’m still waiting there for almost 20 minutes. They don’t deserve to be sitting in that office. They need to treat people better."

Store looked amazing. It’s a huge store on the inside. It kinda of feel like a food court inside a mall. All the associates were busy working keeping the store looking great earlier in the day. I do hope and wish I could visit this locating more often. Everyone was super friendly and nice. Thank them sooo much. Most people wouldn’t say anything to me, probably just speak. But I thank them for even coming to work to even deal with us customers. Thank you to everyone at this location.; A regular customer from 2 years, For a Truck driver like me it's a good clean place.
But Cappuccino machine is an upset for me. I only drink French vanilla and its been more watery from last 2-3 months... Have complain few times but still the same.; Nice big one! Subways, Cinnabon,  and the regular Polot fair! Lounge, showers and seating!; The store itself is nice. But the parking is all filled up with locals pickup trucks and trailers that tow behind pickup trucks. There were three pickup trucks detached from three trailers to take up six spaces. But management must be okay with it cuz they must have been doing it for a while that they're so obvious about it now. Just another way to show a truck drivers aren't appreciated at Pilot.; After traveling overnight, stopping at a place as clean and helpful as this, with the upbeat employees that were there, helped me reset my attitude and start fresh for the remainder of my drive.

They have safe, clean showers. I’d never used a travel stop shower before, and a kind cashier walked me through what to do and assured me I was safe. It was a great shower!

If I’m ever in the area again, I’ll stop even if I don’t need anything, just to experience the smiles & clean, bright shop. And very good coffee, of course!

The photo is the shower waiting area, which was very clean & comfortable."

Disappointing visit; Jocelyn is so amazing. On my long trip it was amazing to see her smiling face.; Big, nice, and clean. There’s a lot of seating if you just want to rest up.; When your parking lot and the roads are just as clear there is no excuse for this. Congrats, your the first Pilot in history to do this. Hope the managers and all the employees are fired immediately. No excuse!!!; A decent stop for grabbing gas, snacks, and drinks for the road.

And clean place to get gas. It's great that they have showers if you need one. I real liked that they have a wendy's attached to the gas station. Great selection of food.; Terrible location corporate needs to come through and remodel the whole management staff like they did the store. Don’t reserve a parking stop here unless you are already in a spot. Per: Manger Michael they are not allowed to move drivers out of the reserve spots. He said the parking lot is too far from the store. So save your money and park were you like except the street I’ve seen cops writing tickets.; Avoid front using your card at the pump here. I used mine on July 28, 2024 at approximately 8:46 pm to get gas as I was too exhausted to walk into the store and just preferred the convenience. Well, this morning on July 29, 2024 I woke up to several charges on my account from a Life Elevation. This Pilot is the only place i used my card at in the last couple of days and to suddenly have fraudulent charges on my account after using it here is no coincidence. I used my card at the pump so it is possible someone put a card skimmer on their pumps. However, I did notice a sticker that said to notify attendant if the sticker appeared to be tampered with. That sticker itself didn't appear to be tampered with but when I called the manager today, she said they put 3 stickers on the pump. I didn't see 3 stickers, only 1 so perhaps that is a red flag. Anywho, this is the first and only place I've ever seen stickers at on the keypads which is a red flag that perhaps this isn't the first time peoples card info have been stolen from this gas station. Just beware with using your card at the pumps here.; 8/20/24 @ 7pm Had an issue at this truck stop was waiting patiently in line, another driver came an jumped in front of me in line. The manager Sarah instead of resolving the issue started yelling at me very rudely with an attitude. I was asking only for respect as she could of resolved it and made the man get in back of the line. instead she talked to me as if i didnt just spend a lot on fuel here at this truck stop and if i was less of a customer i asked for the gm of the store name she said what for? I only asked for respect i waited patiently i wasnt there for any trouble only my receipt. I will never come here again. Sarah is very unproffessional manager you should make your customers feel welcome. Common courtesy not being given a  hard time because you bringing your problems to work.; Pretty nice gas station, with a friendly staff and large selection. Restrooms were clean and well stocked. Located conveniently next to a few restaurants as well, including a Wendy's inside the Pilot."

I didn't examine it closely before I left the store and later discovered the stems on the grapes were actually black.  The grapes were extremely sour and inedible.  I took for granted that because of the store location the produce would be fresh and tasty. Wrong!  Always check everything and don't assume anything, especially not from this store.  This store seems to have gone off the rails some time ago and only got worse.  I question the favorable ratings.  If they really want real favorable ratings, IMPROVE the store.; A truly frightening encounter with the front desk yesterday (young white male) and (middle aged black female) would not let me exchange sushi that was not fresh which was purchased day prior. Explicitly muttered amongst themselves that it needed to be returned same day and required the receipt when it was clearly purchased there. I wasn’t aware they changed the Kroger 100% guarantee policy, and you just don’t play with bad fish. Apparently, these two employees base the official Kroger return policy on your appearance, so I’m not allowed to return bad sushi if I’m dressed in leisure, running errand clothing. Shameful. Went to the larger store nearby and had no issues whatsoever with exchanging the old sushi.; The produce section was filled with items going bad. Yuck! The chips rang up wrong even after I showed the checker the physical ad and digital ad. Another associate walked up and went to the section to check ONLY to find that I was CORRECT!! No apology just blaming the computer system. From now on, I will drive out of my way for better produce and customer service!; They just fired an employee ..who has been with them for 20 + yrs ..... For eating a deli sandwich....maybe she didn't pay for it ....write her up or ask if everything is ok with her ...she's been there so long smh ,.... Her Husband has cancer ....even trying to take all her benefits she has earned over the yrs... The new manager Dustin only cares about his monthly bonuses to pay for his new motorcycle...

Today, my purpose was a bit different – I came here to find a special beer, as requested by a friend who had invited fellow catechists from the church. The beer in question was Hawaiian Kona, something I hadn't heard of before and was eager to try. Walking into this Kroger store was like entering a massive wonderland. The sheer scale of it made me contemplate the logistics involved in keeping the shelves well-stocked – from sourcing items to managing employees and systems. It left me impressed. However, what truly caught my attention was the store's well-organized layout and the extensive range of offerings. It's a one-stop destination with everything you could possibly need – even housing a Starbucks and a flower shop. Navigating the self-checkout, a helpful young man promptly assisted me in expediting the purchase, requiring my date of birth for verification. It's an excellent store that truly provides a wonderful shopping experience!; Second time visiting this location and first time visiting a Kroger in many years, and I must say I was very impressed with the houseware isle! I had no idea that Kroger had started selling these types of items. After only dealing with a commissary (military grocery store), for a number of years, it is good to find a grocery store that not only exceeded my expectations, but even has better inventory and prices! I have found my go-to grocery store!; I bought packaged fish that was still good date wise. When i got home the fish had a rancid and had a slimy coating. But mind you it still looked fresh. Idk what's the deal with these kinda stores selling fish they know is bad. Never again buying raw fish here again.; In and out in 10 minutes after picking up prescription.
Friendly and quick employees.
25 fuel points .  Yeah!!!
This visit was my weekly grocery run. Spoke with one employee who always offers to help if I need it. Self checkout cashier helped me with card issues.
Plenty of stock and being restocked while I shopped.; Got a (painful and very obvious) eye infection. Tried to have my Rx filled for topical ointment. The pharmacy tech didn’t like the Rx my doctor wrote and told me my prescription was “illegal”. The pharmacy manager doubled down.

Nothing like being treated like a petty criminal for trying to fill an antibiotics Rx. Yep. I’m trying to catch a buzz from an erythromycin cream. You caught me.

The team provided excellent service and was incredibly professional throughout the entire process. They arrived promptly, handled my vehicle with care, and made what could have been a stressful situation much easier. I highly recommend this towing service for anyone in need of reliable and professional assistance.; Did an incredible job of towing my daughter’s car out of a hospital ramp.  Was no easy task,  but he put our minds at ease immediately by telling us he would get it out.  He made it look easy and was very friendly.  I should remember his name but unfortunately I don’t.  Might have been Grant or Grayson.    Thanks again.; The person who answered the phone was very nice and efficient. They got to me in about 10 minutes. Grant was so nice and very quick. He made sure I understood what kind of spare I had and made what could have an unpleasant experience very easy. He was excellent. Thanks Bobby & Steve & Grant!; I was in town for a wedding and my check engine light came on the night before I was supposed to leave. The tech working at the time (I unfortunately didn't catch his name or I would give him a big shout out here) was able to diagnose and clear my issue in about 2 minutes based off of an offhand comment I made. The techs seem super knowledgeable and they didn't try to scam me into a lengthy diagnosis and/or unneeded repairs. If I'm ever in town again, this is where I would take my car in an emergency.; Ok experience but wish they'd treat you nicer at front desk. Reluctant to answer questions.
Service itself: i took in for oil change and loud noise on acceleration thinking it was muffler. After oil change, they called and said they couldn't find the noise i was talking about. Asked me to explain what it sounded like then said I could come in and show them. After driving around with a front desk person I couldn't hear it any longer. I asked if low oil could cause the noise and they said yes. After all that, Shouldn't a tech have just reported that my oil was very low and probably causing the noise I was asking about?"

They made a stressful and miserable situation as pleasant as possible! Needed a new catalytic converter, and they gave me an estimate that matched the final bill - no surprises. they checked on a door lock and let me know options for that as well as filled up all my tires and recalibrated my tire light system at no charge. Cannot recommend them enough; My granddaughter had a flat tire because she hit the curb to avoid a driver that was on his phone coming into her lane.  David at C & B Auto saw what happened and came to her rescue.  He pulled the car into his parking lot and put on a brand new tire.  Not only did he put the tire on but he looked under the car to make sure that there was nothing wrong.  When she asked him how much she owes, he said NOTHING.  I couldn't believe it.  There are still good people in the world and they are at C & B Auto.  I am telling everyone about C & B Auto and what they did for my granddaughter.  You guys are truly amazing and thank you so much for what you did for my granddaughter.  I would highly recommend C & B Auto for your car care.; C & B auto is a gem 💎

My car started making funny noises 3 hrs into a 15 hr drive, and I was in the Adirondacks with no options for car service in the area until Monday given the holiday weekend.

I had my car towed to C & B auto where they were open late on Sat after Thanksgiving! they offered to look at it but made no guarantees about repairing. After a short wait, they saw it was a pipe that had broken cleanly and they could weld. They also noted that I had 6 months - a year to repair the entirety of the part.

They graciously completed the job Sat afternoon and charged a reasonable price! after the last ten hour drive,I’m home safely on my couch with a plan to repair my car fully with my local shop.

Thanks again for helping me in that pickle, C & B !!!; I was driving from out of town when my car started to make noise.  I drove from Dallas, TX up to New York with my adult son and five kids and was still 3 hours from my destination.  Brian looked at my car on Saturday and said he would look at it on Monday if it was still making the noise.  It was!  I brought the car in bright and early Monday morning and C &B Auto diagnosed my car within an hour and worked with my mechanic and the manufacturer of the bad alternator (which had only been on my car less than a week) to get the car repaired at no cost to me.  The fact that he spent all that time on the phone, emailing estimates, sending any relevant information instead of just charging me the cost was amazing and very much appreciated.  He went above and beyond and repaired my vehicle quickly.  I was on the road home by 2:30 pm with a brand new alternator.  Big TEXAS thanks to Brian and the team at C&B Auto."

I only needed to check if my ball on my trailer was hitched correctly as my trailer jack wasn't helping with this, I was camping nearby and only needed to borrow a jack or have one of his people jack my trailer.

This would take 1-2 minutes to check, I offered to pay for this service but was told no this place is too small and he has no time. I even offered to pay to borrow the jack and do it myself. No was still his answer.

My trailer was already in his shop, a small 5x8 cargo trailer, and he doesn't have 2 minutes to help someone and their family be safe? I was willing to pay and wait for this service but Ellie is no help. Would not recommend just for the fact he would let anyone drive away in a potentially very unsafe situation, with just a jack needed to fix the situation. And if you think this was one of the shop techs I talked to, I talked to Ellie himself the owner.

I went to Sullivan's tire down the road and they helped me. Confirmed the ball was not hitched in. Ellie was willing to send me down the road unsafe. Sullivan's helped me out and didn't charge me a Penny, even though I asked them if they wanted any money for the service. Oh and btw, it took you longer to read this than it took for Sullivan’s to fix the problem!; We've been going to Eli's for a couple of decades now (that's three cars ago).  I trust them completely.  They are always looking for the most cost effective fix. They never propose a repair that's not needed. And they are always friendly and responsive.  The owner, Eli, is one of the nicest people in Hingham.; Courteous and friendly place to get gas right in the middle of town - which can be very helpful when there days where most of your driving is 'around' town carpooling.; DO NOT GO HERE Took advantage of me being young and inexperienced and scammed me of 50 dollars when filling up gas; Very honest repair shop. I bring multiple cars to them and they only do what is needed. Recently, I brought a car in as thought it might need brakes. Eli told me the brakes are fine. Other repair shops might just replace the brakes. Eli, Max and the team is highly recommended!"

All the mechanics are very honest, timely and friendly. They don't try and take advantage of you which, as a young car owner, is very much appreciated! Any question you have they'll answer (you might even learn something!) and their work is always 10/10.

No matter where I reside in MA, I ALWAYS come back to Sam's Getty for all my inspections, repairs and maintenance.; I have been using Sam’s for over 15 years for gas, inspection stickers and to service multiple vehicles. Sam and his staff are friendly and always willing to explain their work. His mechanics are excellent and his prices are always reasonable and fair. He never overcharges or does unnecessary work. This is a”go to” place for honest repairs!; Very freaking honest people!!!!!!!!!!! Sam's the best ask for him..,... If you want good repair to your car go ahead; Sam's Getty, is a great all around gas station and car maintenance establishment. Sam, is a really good and honest guy! You can get inspection stickers here too! I've brought my Honda here for over 15 years, and have always been very satisfied with the repairs, tune-ups, and maintenance. The prices are the best! Highly recommend!!!; If you are looking for an HONEST and competent mechanic look no further.  I've been coming to this place for 2-3 years and always received the best service whether it was just an inspection sticker or some repair.  They are always extremely honest about the problem, they do a very competent work, and in the end you always get a surprise when it comes to payment - it is always LESS than you expect!  And I have to tell you my hubby is a cheapskate and even he was blown away by how fairly they charge.  love love love this place.  give it a try, you won't regret!"

My only negative (not enough of an issue to take a star away) would be that they could have done a slightly better job getting the bugs off of the windshield and front bumper.

Please Flying j management answer me what's the limit of your greediness so that you cannot invest a little part of your profit to patch the entrance to the trucking parking which has a huge crater, and it's been there for a few years! We're okay to take your profit truckers but f you to provide a smooth entrance to the fuel and parking lot - that seems your motive here flying J management.

Also there's a huge part of the parking lot behind which is just mud and craters, which Flying J could at least straighten out , not even saying they should put a pavement on it.

Corporate greediness is not a surprise, and I wouldn't not support your greedy business with a single cent , I only have to stop at Pilot flying J because my company uses them for fueling.

Another point is the drivers who fuel forever and don't move their trucks from the fuel lane , nobody could punish them for that and they exploit that.

So if you want to experience the high concentration of stupidity, carelessness and selfishness the Flying J location welcomes you and will provide all those with happiness!

The only great thing about this location is giant crows , who are fun to watch , and possess much higher intelligence than most humans in this place.

I go get in line and there were three people in front of me, WHICH took the ONE worker 30 minutes to help. She called for help because there were 10 people in line.

Is that how pilot/flying J has to treat their customers? Is that how the 300+ trucks fleet has to be treated?

My completly empty 20 lb propane tank was significantly underfilled even after I was assured that I would receive the full 20 lbs that I paid for. The manager who pumped the propane went to pains to prevent me from reading the scale when he was through with the fill. Guess why. If he'll short a customer who is standing there making it clear that he expects to get what was promised, then I can't help wondering how much he'll short a customer who is less vigilent. If I wanted an underfilled tank I could have saved myself a headache and done a Blue Rhino exchange. But hey, at least this station has the most expensive gasoline in town; I walked in to make a $4 purchase one evening here, and 30 minutes later my credit card that I used there was making unauthorized transactions. The lady at the counter scolded me for not wearing a mask (I am vaccinated) and seemed visibly annoyed with me. Seems a little suspicious to me. Obviously, I will never be going here again as I really don't want my credit card information stolen again.; The owners are very rude. The woman is always on her phone and could care less about you. Gas is over priced as well. Avoid if possible."

It’s scary exiting back onto Rt9, I always feel like this might be the “how it ends moment”😳 especially when there’s someone behind you needing to exit & theres NO Break in between the FAST passing vehicles. I’ve had no issues w/the guys pumping the gas. They say Hello & ask Cash or Credit? I usually tell them $20 CASH Regular. One time it somehow went a few dollars beyond the $20. I very firmly said “SORRY THATS ON YOU & NO I DON’T have CREDIT card.” And I sure as hell wouldn’t provide my bank card. But since I’m a regular customer I said “give me the receipt, write your name on it, so when I come back, well make good” they agreed & it worked out fine. Maybe it’s just me🤷🏻‍♀️. When I enter, I always ask if I should pull up further & they seem to appreciate that.
If I say “Fill the Tank, CASH Reg” they do & the machine stops when it’s full. You should Know the BASIC SIZE of the GAS Tank for whatever vehicle your driving especially if its your regular vehicle. So YOU should have enough Cash or credit on hand to cover the cost when you ask to fill the tank.
If Not, like if your driving a U-Haul, its usually Basic Info in the vehicles Manual that should be in the glove box.
Some Gas Stations get annoyed when people need to fill a portable Gas containers. They LOL when my friend pulls in with his TESLA to fill his portable containers😅 & they ask him a million questions.
Past 2 years, the only (not a major problem) I’ve encountered was this particular Gas Station seems to be Ground Zero for those Spotted Lantern Flies! OMG I do feel bad for these Gas attendants because they’re literally COVERED in them!; I cannot stress enough how tremendously awful the service was at this gas station. If I could give a 0 star review, I gladly would. I may send a letter to Raceway so I can purposefully write “0 stars” for the review. I asked the gas station attendant to put $20 in the u-haul that I was driving. It was my first time ever driving a u-haul and I wanted to gauge how much it would cost to get the u-haul to a half tank of gas which is all that was required from u-haul to return it. After $20 worth was filled up, I realized I needed more and the gas attendant emphatically said “no” and walked away. I tried to get his attention and he was not making eye contact with me like the pouty ex you dated in 10th grade. He finally walked over to me, I tried to create understanding with the situation, explaining that it was my first time using the u-haul, and he did not comply with my request. Think about this: Raceway has an employee working for them is denying the sale of gas. Is this what is best for Raceway? They have a real life, barely human employing denying customers gas. Because of his actions, I had to go to another gas station and make two u-turns to get to my destination. If i tragically got into an accident a long the way, my family would have a massive lawsuit against Raceway and the gas attendant would maybe be able to work in a prison if he’s lucky. Terrible, terrible, terrible service. I will certainly be making sure everyone I know on this planet never goes to that gas station again.; I live in Pennsylvania where you have to pump the gas by yourself. I enjoy buying gas from new jersey especially during winter so I don't have to come out of my car. I have never had a bad experience since i have been buying gas in New Jersey or from this gas station so its a 5 star for me. The attendants are always nice and friendly.; I've been coming here for years - at least 13. Unfortunately, today was the last time. I clearly told the attendant I wanted $6 worth of gas, in fact I told him twice. He proceeds to put $12 worth in. Then he begs for the extra money. Then we have an argument. I should have just left, but I paid him the rest of the money, which I really needed for other expenses.

It ended with a screaming match. He needs to get his hearing checked. ""Six"" and ""twelve"" do not sound ANYTHING alike.; RUDE. LACK EMPATHY. GO TO QUICKCHECK.
Me and my SO were on empty and it was 9:56 and if you take a quick peek at their schedule, they close at 10:00. The man refused to give us service and thankfully QuickCheck was open and more than willing to help us."

Closest gas station to my house so you just lost a life long customer over 10 measly dollars.; Good prices and service; Nice Job on providing glasses on a very reasonable prices.; My mom has had many issues here. She politely asks for her card back while getting gas rather than them leaving it in the machine so that someone can’t walk by and take it etc. The manager has told her she can just ask for it and they’ll give it to her. She only gets it back if it is the manager who pumps her gas. Today, she pulled up and asked the Indian guy for her card back and he ignored her leaving it in the machine. So she got out and took her card back and he proceeded to stop the pump on her. So she tried to go in and get the manager but he left. Meanwhile, the car next to us asked for his card back so that he can run inside and the guy gave it back to him. Now we feel like this man is trying to steal card information.

The pharmacy is simply impossible to get a hold of, the medications are almost always ""out of stock"" and I've been told on numerous occasions that they are short staffed. While I've tried to be understanding, how much longer will this go on? If you'd like your prescriptions to be filled on time and to have your phone calls answered, I suggest using a different location.; Their pharmacy is probably the worst pharmacy I have ever experienced in over 50 years! Not only is the staff nasty! I caught one of their staff lie directly to my face, saying that I came in to early to get my prescription, only to find out that they were out of stock (why not just tell me that? Rather than lie)  I can go on and on. So as of today I’m transferring all my prescription’s (and my wife’s)to another pharmacy, anything has to be better than this place.; There is NO communication by phone with this pharmacy. I placed several calls to update my insurance information so my scripts can be processed. It’s a run around that leads to being disconnected. When I called the store itself, I’m told they are short staffed and if I want to ask a question “just come in” because “they don’t answer the phone” so I phoned a different Walgreens to get my scripts filled. They answered after 2 rings. POOR customer care. Go elsewhere if you value customer satisfaction and attention to your health care needs. I contacted corporate about this store.; Good not great.  The store is adequately stocked and well kept.  The pharmacy is somewhat hit or miss.  Bad communication.; Pharmacy is a complete joke, staff at the counters dont know what theyre doing. At least the pharmacist is nice

Staff at registers are beyond rude and impatient. Constantly give additude for even the simplest questions, no customer priority, and i understand that nobodys perfect and everyone has bad days, I come in regularly and im repeatedly treated harshly. The managers and single pharmacist are very polite and nice however, they are very attentive and caring, hence why i wont give this place one star"

Very shady young guy with glasses. Always look if your car is filling up! He didn’t even start it until I got down to see why it wasn’t fueling and acted like he forgot. Bad service!; I could care less about your price, you don't yell at people, especially my wife. Wife pulled in slowly, basically a normal speed.
A car apparently came into the station against traffic, northbound in the southbound lane. Large man working yelled at my wife to reverse, she did.

They have a great variety  not just burgers. I've covered a good portion of their menu over the years, and I can say I've never had anything bad! The owners and the staff are some of the nicest people and make you glad to be there.; The burger was nice and juicy, had large enough pieces of bacon and avocado. Very tasty and reasonably priced in comparison to other burger joints. The staff was respectful.

The 2nd pic is the Smokehouse Burger. Not thrilled with the 2.7% credit card fee for dining in, but I'd still eat here again.

I almost always have beef in my quesadillas, but decided to try their chicken quesadilla since they had a special that day. It was great- they were able to accommodate my request of using a wheat wrap, which was cooked just right: slightly crispy but still mostly soft like I prefer it. The contents were nice and flavorful, and came with a generous amount of fries. It was served in a biodegradable container.; We picked dinner from this place tonight. The quality of food was very high, it was delicious, and the portions were generous. We got Tex Mex Burger, Focaccia Sandwich,  Crispy Chicken Sandwich, Fries, and Onion Rings. The place was very clean, and the staff was very polite and efficient.; This place was disappointing.  The burger tasted like a frozen cafeteria burger!  The burger wasn’t juicy at all, and the meat was bland.  I had the Frisky Whiskey burger which was supposed to come with a maple bourbon sauce, but it didn’t taste like anything.  It needed more sauce.  The fries were mediocre.  I also had a chocolate peanut butter shake here,  and this is the worst shake I ever had in my life!  I would of rated the burger and fries 3 stars, but the shake brought this review down to 2 stars.  I couldn’t even drink the shake through the straw because the candy wasn’t blended in, and it got jammed up in the straw!  I had to sip the shake from the cup!  It wasn’t blended at all, and it wasn’t good!  The staff was really nice and friendly, but the food was mediocre.; Getting hangry so I stopped into burger boys for some lunch. I ordered the good morning burger with a side of fries. Total came to $16.01. Place had a rustic/wood-themed feel with 8 booths and 5 tables. There were 5 screens of menu items, desserts in a small case and packaged desserts to go. It took slightly less than 10 minutes to prepare the food. Burger was larger than expected, cooked well done and served hot! Juicy burger in all though the onions lacked seasoning and the egg wasn't runny.  Fries had great texture but too needed salt and pepper on them. The cole slaw side was a nice touch, fresh. The place clearly had regulars, I think it's average."

You can see it on the chicken skin - it's just sitting too long in the rotisserie.  Probably great when freshly cooked but can't seem to time that.; Honestly, I just don’t understand why they changed the chicken. It used to be so good a few years ago when I first ate at this place, and now I cant even look at it without wanting to puke. It looks like something I can get at any average/below average diner which is sad because it used to be 5+ stars for me. The fries are also just mediocre and undercooked in my opinion (as well as the chicken). And no, this is not a one time occurrence that can be remedied because I’ve gone twice in the past two weeks. I am genuinely very confused- is this a price issue? New restaurants open and think they can just reduce quality and become sell outs and then wonder why they get some bad reviews? Ironic. The workers are very nice and it’s a nice place to eat but I cant give such compliments to the food. I would give 3/5 but Im just so disappointed with the unecessary changes so a 2 is appropriate.; Chicken, ribs and fries are good!! BUT their wings were disappointing… tired many of their things and finally decided to get their wings however it was very mediocre lol but everything else is good!!; One of my favorite places to grab lunch. Very quick service with a nice menu selection. Everything is hot and tastes fresh. You can walk in and be sitting eating a half rotisserie chicken with a couple sides in a few minutes. Employees are always pleasant. Great service; I ordered this on doordash, am glad i was not disappointed. The food taste amazing, especially the corn bread"

Very thankful to all the pharmacist who have been courteous, helpful, and respectful every month I visit here. Store is well kept and never overcrowded.

I absolutely can’t believe this. Without this medication i am prone to seizures and when i asked them how a pharmacist thinks they have the authority to overrule a doctors prescription, i was just told that i would have to get it tomorrow again.

Well spoiler alert! Tomorrow is here and now they are closed. I can’t get my script transferred and there’s nobody there to even give me the guidance of what i can do. I understand the pandemic caused many businesses to operate in lesser hours due to shortage of staff, but i find this completely unacceptable. Now you are messing with not only my medication, but my health.

Thanks a lot!; I have been shopping at many different Walgreens for about 15 years and I always come across managers like the one in Marlboro.
I asked about a product that I JUST bought 8 minutes prior (in another Walgreens) and how they had it for a significantly cheaper price than this particular Walgreens did. This pharmacy is not an individual business that can have different prices on the same items. Sale items should be the same price in every store. Before I even told her the situation she immediately came to the cashier and said we don't do price match. I showed her the receipt to the product with the value next to it and she didn't want to look at it. She said that all Walgreens had different prices based on demand... which I know is not true because then a circular would be pointless.
She immediately just walked away. Nothing else. Came, said what she needed to and walked off.
When Walgreens claims to be at the corner of happy and healthy, they should at least have managers who oh.. I don't know, smile?
I'm not one to write reviews but if she at least pretended to listen or care, I wouldn't be so upset by her apathy =/"

The staff at the Shake Shack was very friendly and attentive.  Remove our waste and refilled our drinks better than most full service restaurant's.; $50 for 2 small burgers,  2 small, cold fries, and 2 shakes. Absolutely disappointing. Too expensive for crap burgers. I will not be back.; This is our second meal from Shake Shack in Freehold. The hamburgers and fries were great, but this time they forgot the bacon on my bacon cheeseburger - last time the order was bigger but correct. They still have no online ordering (it's been 2 weeks ) so I still have to order at the drive through. It was a long wait on the line, and I had to wait another 5 minutes after I paid for the food. The food was delicious though.

** Update **

A week after I posted this, they finally got online ordering. We've ordered a bunch of times since then, and every order was correct. The order is usually out when they say it will be ready, but tonight my order wasn't brought out until I cornered one of the workers and she eventually brought it out. She added another order of fries because it was late, which was nice. The food was delicious again, of course.; From the minute we pulled into the parking lot our experience was excellent. It’s extremely clean & well kept. We went inside and were greeted by happy smiling employees which is honestly rare these days. While my 2 young sons were being a little rowdy ordering was simple due to the cashier being calm & helpful. He assured me that they were being fine which was very nice of him to say. We took a seat outside on the outdoor patio which was also very clean.
Our order came out very quickly & was delicious! It was brought to us by Madison who is an absolute gem. He interacted with my boys & was a pleasure. He even offered the boys custard which made their day! We will absolutely be back.; Went to try shake shack for the very first time. Upon arriving the parking is decently fancy for a fast food joint. But when entering the building the floor was sticky. I'm not sure it was my shoes but I felt like I was stucked to the ground. I order a smash double cheeseburger with a side of fries and I cannot believe that this is the only fast food chain that does not serve as a meal. I had to order the burger and fries separately and then the shocking part was almost 20 dollars and I couldn't get a drink because it was so damn expensive. The service was reasonably decently, it isn't the best service in the world but it works. But the food is whole different story, I got the burger and it was just and all fresh and nothing frozen like my dad used to make. The fries are hot and reasonably salty unlike other fast food chains. Overall, shake shack in this location is an experience that I get to relive. Just fix the prices and nothing else."

I visited this Walgreens location today to fill a prescription. ( I'm out of town so I've never been to this location before )
As a regular Walgreens customer with two young children in tow, I naively assumed my prescription information would be accessible across locations.

When I politely inquired about the possibility of filling my prescription at this location, I was met with a shocking level of rudeness from a pharmacy employee.
Instead of offering assistance or providing information, the employee dismissively snapped, ""These pharmacists have a hundred scripts they're filling. I am not going to put you before all of them. If you want to wait hours, go right ahead."" Her tone was accusatory and completely inappropriate.

You never know what someone is going through. Everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect, especially when seeking healthcare services. I myself was dealing with a lot of stress that day. Feeling humiliated and disrespected, I politely requested my prescription back and left the store.

The experience was incredibly stressful, especially given the challenging day I was already having. Not only did I have to brave the rain with my young children, but I also had to find a new pharmacy to fill my prescription.

Walgreens should hold their employees accountable for such appalling behavior. It's disheartening to encounter such a lack of empathy and professionalism, particularly in a customer service role.

Needless to say, the next time I'm in Neptune City, I will not be stopping by that location for any reason!; I love going to this Walgreens. For it to be considered a pharmacy, it has stepped its game up. And you can get just about anything you need or want, even in the middle of the night. I  just found out that they also have selected grocery items that you can use your OTC card on. Hurray  for Walgreens!!!; I want to give a shout out to Nigel, a cashier at this Walgreens. I was using an OTC card grocery shopping for my disabled friend and Nigel was very sweet, and scanned my items with a smile on his face. You do not get that very much when you're using an OTC card. Thank you Nigel!!; He was nice helpful I will be back soon; Very helpful staff!
24 hour store and staffed pharmacy so those late night needs can be met.

As an aside, it is unknown how many initial cases of Covid were actually EVALI. Fake vaporizers with unknown additives can cause serious lung damage. There are plenty of locations to purchase legitimate vaporizers in Redbank. I would absolutely steer clear of Welsh Farms to purchase one. It’s not worth the risk to your health. Although they will insist they are real. If you check the packaging, there’s usually a scratch off with a number to check online for authenticity. I had checked different devices multiple times, and every time they came up as unauthentic.

You enter this Walgreens that looks almost it just had a fire drill session, looking at how empty it looks. Then as you head to the pharmacist area, the scene completely changes and you feel you are in the middle of Asbury Park.

THANK YOU!; Hi, I have not seen worst job applying service like this before.
I applied a cashier position at New Brunswick Walgreen and I didn’t receive any response about my application. I went 3nd times to the store to meet to the manager. Although one of the supervisors called to the store manager for me, she didn’t meet me. She replied her employee about my application to wait.
After 1 month, when I called to the manager who picked up the phone and I said, I came 3 times to meet you about my application.  Then she hung up the phone to disconnect. I didn’t realized how she treat me , so I called again, I apologized her for disconnected phone conversation , but she rudely treated me like  that “I am gonna look up your application “ and hung up the phone  again that is second time. She didn’t listen my conversation. I didn’t know how she rudely treated me like that. I just wanted to know about my application that rejected or not. I just want to say , don’t waste time applying a job at the New Brunswick Walgreen.; The female manager here is disgusting and has no phone etiquette what-so-ever.  She continuously picked up the phone and put me on hold without saying hello or hold on because she was a punk and didn't want to speak to me.  I know the Walgreens is in the hood but she didn't have to be a product of her environment.  The manager was on duty on 1/26/24 at 2:20 PM!!!!"

I was shocked as the mechanic turned out to be very rude, profane and abusive just because I asked few questions and a discount. I would never go back to this garage without hesitation. I think I answered my own question - ""Why is nobody ever here to get their stuff fixed?"""

1. 2nd Script: Staff member I spoke to on the phone was curt and rude. If asked her to repeat what she said (accent plus a lot of background noise), she got irritated. Side conversations with colleagues while on with me. I'm not hard of hearing or demented - I guess she thought I was.

2. Both times, my prescription was not ready when they said it was. My wife had to wait while they actually filled it (first time). I called them just now (2nd Script) about a script that ""was supposed to be put in Sunday"". and was not. So, you can add incompetence to rudeness.

Done with this place.; Walgreens' Photo Center provided an outstanding experience. Nancy, the employee, was efficient and helpful. She greeted me warmly, guided me through photo options, and offered valuable suggestions. Nancy's attention to detail and creativity enhanced my prints. She patiently answered my questions and ensured my satisfaction. I highly recommend Walgreens' Photo Center for its quality prints and exceptional customer service. Kudos to Nancy and the team!; I called store to see if they carried a certain nail polish. Chris answered the phone and actually went to look for it while I held on. You don't get service like this anymore. Thank you Chris for great customer service!!; I wanted to take a moment to recognize an employee that went way above & beyond for me. Liz (I believe she works in the cosmetic and beauty department) was checking out my purchase when I realized I didn’t have my credit card. I asked her to hold the purchase while I frantically searched for it in my car, prior stores, etc. Luckily a Good Samaritan found my car in Walgreens parking lot and returned it to Liz who then took the liberty of searching my name in the photo database to retrieve my number and call me. I would have never guessed my card was there. I’m so appreciative she took the time to look into my phone number. She could have just held on to it. Liz absolutely deserves recognition for her kindness and loyalty to customers!!!!!; It's a Walgreens and meets all of my Walgreen expectations.  They are interested in getting to know it's residents and care about what we care about. The staff communicates well with one another and are very helpful."

Make sure you always look for the burger of the month. It always rotate monthly. Once you order, they bring the food to your table and clean up after you leave. They have 2 types of ketchup: regular and jalapenos. The small fry is very filling for me. I was debating between a regular and small and decided with the small.

Next time I want to try the milkshakes as everyone who ordered there got one and it looked delicious.; I do not eat a lot of meat, so I'm picky about my hamburgers. If I am going to eat a Hamburger, it needs to worth it. This is my favorite local place to get a delicious burger. I usually get the Napa because it has fig jelly, Bleu cheese, sauteed oniins, and lettuce. I like my burgers rare, amd they actually cook it rare. It is moist amd perfectly seasoned. The brioche bun is always fresh. My friend ordered onion rings on this particular trip. I tried them, and they were good. I do not eat a lot of deep fried foods, though.They have great milkshakes here, too.; Food: 1/5. Onion rings had more oil than Suadi Arabia. Fries were cold. It costed $8 more to add the vegan patty, which wasn’t even that good to be honest. Jalepenos are not spicy, rather they are sour :(
Service: Everyone was pretty friendly
Atmosphere: Everything was clean and the environment was decent.; I’ve been to Burger Bros several times, and I’ve always enjoyed my burger here.  I find that their regular burger is much more juicier than their dry aged bison burger.  Tonight, I had their Mexican burger, and I loved all the toppings it came with.  The chipotle Mayo was delicious!  Their fries are like McDonald’s fries with less seasoning.  They are very good, but can use some more salt.  Their milkshakes are 5 stars!  They are amazing, and you must order one!  I love their chocolate peanut butter cheesecake shake!  I recommend Burger Bros in Marlboro!; You are greeted by friendly staff as you walk up to the counter. We also didn’t have to wait long for food to be brought out. The food tasted great and there was someone to check up on us periodically. Outstanding service."

No matter what time is the day you go you'll be waiting at least an hour usually longer. They tell you 15 minutes and then it takes 2 hours. They do not value their customer's time at all. I'm sure the only reason these things in business is because they're 24 hours and their location

You're better off taking the time and going to another neighborhood to get your prescription filled, and you'll still probably be back before this Walgreens would have taken care of you.; I called the pharmacy they hang up on me. I called again. Waited 10 mins no answer. Called about 5 times in an hour. No one talks to you. They just pick up and hang up on you. Why is this a pharmacy? Horrible horrible.

Whenever I go in the morning for breakfast, I get the turkey breakfast bagel sandwich. With their excellent service in mind, I don’t know why they love to put mayo on my sandwiches even though I always request no mayo.

I’m not sure if this is an odd request, but this is my only complaint.; Coffee is really great. Sizzli is great- turkey sausage, egg white on muffin is my favorite.

Save your time and your energy.  Go get some Vicks or something and wait till the next day for a real pharmacy! ZERO STARS!!!; Update 7/31/24:
once again…the pharmacy lacks order and communication skills. I am due for a refill on meds that help keep pain from my recent surgery in check. Was told one thing by one pharmacist yesterday about a delay and another thing by someone else today. None of this was communicated with me though the text and email that they normally communicate through.

And on top of that…I was on hold for 25mins with a person picking up the phone multiple times and placing it back directly on hold. Basically I was being cycled in the phone cue. After finally speaking to someone, the way in which they communicate was most def not in a kind or caring manner. Very condescending and borderline rude…you know the ones, nice/nasty. After this refill I think I need to find a different 24 hour Walgreens because this one seriously treats patients like crap.

7/25/25:
I picked this pharmacy because I never had an issue, it’s close to home, and it’s open 24hrs. Little did I know I’d be having to deal with delays, not only for pain meds but antibiotics and something as simple as stool softeners. If there’s a problem,  I’m aware that the pharmacist must handle any issues that may occur but how long should that take and what was the hold up on the antibiotic and stool softener which isn’t a pain med? Seems like an ill run pharmacy at this point. No one should have to run back in forth to a pharmacy over a three day time period.; I dropped prescriptions off on 9/13/2024 I can back to drop off another on 9/23/2024 and two of the three I dropped off were not ready and I never received a text. They told me my number wasn’t in the system. Yet my number was in the system when I dropped them off. They even sent me a code to verify it was me. I came back today 9/26/24 and they tell me the doctor didn’t specify the dosage and I would have to call the doctor. I was like nobody called to tell me? Yall had the prescriptions all these days and no one called the doctor?? I asked for my prescriptions back now they can’t find it. Yet the pharmacy called the doctor in front of me to get the dosage!!! They told me it’ll take 5 minutes only  13 minutes ago!!!! I’m soooo done with this location!! It’s gone to hell!!! This is why businesses lose out to other businesses because of the sorry shotty work by employees that don’t give a crap!! My name is Kenney Cattenhead and I approve this message!; Smack in the middle of a predominantly Black and Brown town this walgreens NEVER has inventory, fills prescriptions a min of 2 days post receipt of dr orders and consistently has a 30 min wait at the pharmacy counter and drive through despite having 2 pharmacists and six pharm aides...and a deficit in medications on hand to prescibe.

They did an excellent job, completing the work quickly without compromising quality. The staff was incredibly polite and professional throughout the entire process. My truck is running better than ever, and the entire experience was seamless. Highly recommend!; I came in to get a few things fixed on my truck and trailer and not only does this shop have an extremely comfortable driver’s lodge but the friendliness and professionalism of the front desk staff (Teara & Addie) and the gentleman working on my truck (Tyrell & Skyrim) definitely exceeded my expectations!!! They made sure I was comfortable during my wait and constantly kept me updated on what was going on. The mechanics made it very clear to me that they would make sure everything would be fixed to where they and I will feel safe getting back on the road. I can’t thank them enough and 100% recommend Bar M Diesel  for their excellent service!; We were stuck in Cove Fort with our 45’ motorcoach with a DEF sensor issue. I contacted Bar M and the ladies in the office were very accommodating and fit me in knowing our situation. When we arrived they took our coach right in and starting right in on working on it. In a little over 2 hours it was done. Billie and Tyler were very concerned that everything work correctly and took it for a test drive. When they got back they were satisfied that everything was operating correctly but the codes did not clear. Billie investigated it found the codes and took his time to make sure they were not active. I was in a hurry but they were not letting us leave until they were happy with the job.
I highly recommend Billie and Tyler as 2 very competent mechanics and they are hard to find. The office staff is very welcoming and made us feel very comfortable.
Thank you!!; On 09/26/2024 we got stuck with our 13-ton RV truck in the damp clay on the Pruess bank. We called BarMDiesel and asked for help. After sending the location and a photo, we received a quote for $5,783 (+ $202 service fee). Shocked by the high price, we inquired about the basis of the calculation. There was no fixed price, 6.5 hours had been estimated, of which 2 hours each for the journey to and from the site and 2.5 hours for the recovery. If it took longer we would have to pay more, if it was less we would get our money back. After our payment was confirmed, the driver was sent to us. On time, 2 hours later Austin arrived and had us recovered after 20 minutes. We informed the service immediately and asked for a refund. We received the answer that the journey had now taken 3 hours each way and that we would therefore not get any money back. They wanted to call us back again, but this has not happened to date. We wrote an email and still received no reply 4 days later.
To summarize, we can say. We were very satisfied with Austin, who gave us professional and fast help. The advisors on the phone were also friendly and we have no complaints about the service in general. We would have awarded 5 stars for this.
The price as such was a shock and seems disproportionately high to us. However, even this would not have led to a rating, as we agreed to the contract.
The disappointment that led to the poor rating is based on the fact that price components were explained to us and we were promised a refund for fewer hours, which was subsequently rejected for absolutely incomprehensible reasons. In addition, we have not even received a reply to our written complaint in this regard. What a shame!; Bar M has a fantastic group of folks, from the team in the field to the office team. They were dispatched to recover our truck and RV, which had rolled over by Panguitch Lake. Upon arrival everyone on the field recovery team spoke to my wife and me, ensuring we were okay. The following Monday, we met at the office to recover our personal belongings and showed us the same level of service as the field team.

Great group of folk with excellent customer service and friendly to work with."

Appreciation of the truckers in it's finest...; Pros : This was one of the cleanest Pilots I have seen.
Cons : The shower didn’t had ANY hot water. It was the coldest shower I have ever taken. Also, when you are in the trucks parking, the app thinks you’re not yet at the truck stop so it won’t let you reserve a shower until you walk really close to the building. Pretty annoying that you can’t wait in your truck for the shower because of that… And to top it off, the wait for shower was pretty long (~1h)

Overall clean, but some problems must be adressed here and there.; I have been waiting for more than an hour to get a shower. It is crazy that one shower is available after an hour or two. I don’t believe drivers are taking 10 hours in the showers. Just don’t spend a dime in this Pilot which doesn’t care about drivers time. No more stopping here. $700 waste of money spending on diesel.; During my recent visit to this Pilot location, I was thoroughly disappointed with the state of the shower facilities. It appears that the night shift cleaning staff is not committed to their duties. I overheard a driver expressing his dissatisfaction to an employee about the wet and unclean shower floor, which was indeed disgusting. The employee’s attempt to justify the incomplete cleaning was unconvincing and unacceptable.

As a paying customer, I find it outrageous that anyone should have to use a shower that is left wet and unclean. This results in a highly unpleasant experience. Additionally, the overpowering smell of air freshener in the bathroom was nauseating and seemed to be the only effort made to maintain cleanliness.

I sincerely hope that the management takes immediate action to improve the cleanliness and hygiene of the shower facilities. Until then, I will not be using the showers at this location again.; Omg this is the FIRST  Pilot I've seen where the drink stations r sparkling. The 3rd shift did her big one she deserves a raise or promotion.  Drink stations is a part of food safety. Cudos"

I think the town deserves good workers and good services.; Excellent customer service! Extremely inviting and helpful staff, especially Jeremy. I had to stop in to purchase engine oil and Jeremy not only made the effort to grab some extra stock for me from the back, but kindly offered to assist me with all of my questions and needs. He saw that I needed a little assistance with adding the engine oil to my car and without me even having to ask he came out to the parking lot and assisted me each step of the way. Very friendly and warm energy, and its good to see that! Especially in days when it can seem like customer service has gone out the window!; On Oct 22 2021 went into the store to get some items. Approached the counter to an employee named George. He told me not to return to that store with my business all because I didn’t want him to touch my ID (COVID) since when I was walking in he was handling money & didn’t proceed to disinfect his hands prior to attending me. Then proceeded to make false claims that my ID is fake & had suspicions it wasn’t me because my nails were painted! It’s sad & concerning to be met with such discrimination especially in a place of business that runs off return customers. Hopefully this shines light and handled accordingly for the simple fact if I was the owner I wouldn’t want my customers treated as so !; Completely shocked it has 2.2 stars. Should be zero. The person at the counter couldn’t have been more hostile. He was so abrasive I walked out without making my purchase. I’d rather drive to another gas station than give them a dime.; the manager of the place is completely hostile. 5:30 at night people were trying to dine alfresco outside at a restaurant nearby and he came outside with the leaf blower kicking dust up dust. I tried to drive over and tell him nicely when I was done in my wheelchair none-the-less and the guy turn around told me to f off and then called the cops on.I wish I could upload a video because the guy was completely out of line and to be out there at that hour blowing dirt all over everybody's dinnershouldn't have come as a surprise he was doing it intentionally and as soon as I tried talking to him he didn't want to stop and chose to cuss at me and call the cops. The cops thought he was even unreasonable. I don't know if it was the owner of the manager but to me it was one in the same.I'll make sure I never shop in this store again. I was trying to do a nice thing and let him know that he was upsetting people but he's got issues."

Especially the ones that are grateful to be working, it really shows in their work, and enthusiasm, they genuinely make you feel welcome. I definitely recommend anyone to visit the store and you may see what I'm talking about. Of course they were always be a couple of people in this world that always have their mind somewhere else. You just have to ignore them. They may have more ambition to do something different somewhere else and possibly one day they will. I don't hold that against them, those individuals will never change my mind about how great the store is.; Newly opened within the past year, this new gas station is by far the most updated, accessible, and recommendable station within the greater Purcellville area. With sixteen pumps, a spacious parking lot, a clean presence, and large store, other locations pale in comparison.

Unlike other stations in the area, the biggest benefit here is how easy it is to access their commodities and to avoid traffic when leaving.; This 7-11 Shell has a very very good chicken joint inside. The pictures speak for themselves. I was told by the chef that all the food is fresh (including the fried fish) and they rotate the food out every 30 mins. Has all the other standard 7-11 features. Slurpees and taquitos etc. Coffee slurpees too.; This place should have more stuff for how big it is but it's really just an oversized that 7-11 with a seating area for the food bar (fried chicken) and a collection of coffee machines. It's ok, it's newer and cleaner and not too busy.; The restroom was a mess. Urine all over the floor. No paper towels to dry your hands. I brought it to the attention of the store clerk.

We filled up our truck and bought chips and soda inside.  We parked in only marked parking space available and while waiting for my husband and son to use the restroom the gas truck told me to move so he can deliver.  Then the employee came out to tell us to move as my husband was coming back to our truck with the keys.  I told him we’re not doing anything wrong and that he should mark it no parking if it needs it to be open.  He was rude saying I was escalating by talking back to him.  We left at that moment now that my husband was back, wish I could take our business back.; Easy on/off 395 - but not very clean. There are not many options and this one was quick and easy...but if I was there again I'd try some other station.; Stopped for gas and snacks. While fueling asked for key to bathroom. Was told bathroom only for paying customers in a condescending your not a customer tone by the very young person behind counter. I said we were getting gas and was going to buy something else. Employee finally rudely said key was out. I left to see about using restroom. I unfortunately purchased a snack and was treated with contempt and my purchase was pushed at me.  Will not shop there again. We were giving benefit of doubt this time after problem in past. Never again.; I'm not surprised by the other reviews. The employees are very rude.  They do not respect the ADA, kicking out service animals.  I kindly left my animal outside and came back to present them with my card stating the federal laws about service animals and to discuss the situation.  They refused to read the card or engage in a civil discussion and claimed I was trespassing.  Nice.; Terrible service... I have been on the road for a long time trying to get back home and needed to go to the bathroom. So I went in there to ask to use the restroom they rudely said ""are you a customer"" I said ""yes I'm going to get gas"" they said "" get gas first"" so I was kind and got gas. When I went back in and said I got gas they didn't believe me and kept saying no you didn't. I procced to bring out my phone and show them the bank statement showing that I got gas. They questioned it for a long time and acting as if I was committing some crime trying to use the restroom. Finally after minutes of saying that I did not get gas it finally popped up on their system and they tossed the key on the counter. Worst experience I've ever had at a gas station. I don't care if there is the covid pandemic happening you should not be rude to customers like that at all. Will never go back there and I do not recommend anyone else to go there either."

Lo recomiendo!; UPDATE// So apparently now you can order online for pick up and if you register you accumulate points that turn into cash. My husband ordered carne asada and used like 23 dlls in accumulated points! …. Love this place even more!!!! Last time I was there I ordered ground beef on the app, when I got there I had to wait a bit because they were FRESHLY GROUNDING MY MEAT!! Whaaat? I waited like 3 minutes while they were packing it up and the burgers we made were just so tender and tasted so good. It gives a México feel….I hate giving bad reviews to businesses but in this case having a good experience repeatedly I had to share it.///

Ordered carne asada nachos with guacamole. AMAZING!!! they always give you salsa and grilled jalapeños with your meal. I also love getting my mexican soda made with real sugar, compared to american coke, Mexican coke is way better. Great place to order dinner or lunch when you are in a hurry and want to pass on mickey d’s. Special thanks to Juan for frying my chips before serving my nachos, super fresh and crunchy.

I went to this station since the sign said *$3.799*.  Unfortunately, after I did my Shell Rewards and Circle K Easy Pay I didn't check the pump since I was just there yesterday afternoon and the price was the same.  The price was really ***$3.949*** a gallon for regular unleaded.  So, be careful when you purchase gas...they might have a nice price just to lure you in.; Rude store associate. The following took place on Friday, December 21st. I stop to fuel up and the pump stated to ""See Cashier for Receipt"" since it was out of receipt paper. I go inside and request a copy of the receipt for the pump I was using (pump #2), and the associate asked me: ""How much was it?"" I was confused by his question, so I just repeated myself ""I just need the receipt for pump #2"". He then says ""I know, how much was it?"" I ask, ""What do you mean how much?"". At that point, he scoffs at me and then prints out a receipt for the wrong transaction. I take it and leave since I didn't want to further aggravate an already disgruntled employee with such a small request.

I don't know what was going on with this employee, but I've never had to declare the amount of my transaction in order to get a copy of the receipt from any other gas station (including other Circle K branches). It's *always* been just the pump number alone that sufficed. Never been a problem till now.

Definitely not going to return to this particular Circle, especially because of the store associate's incompetence to fulfill such a simple request.

It's the small things that count when it comes to decent customer service. I advise management to better emphasize this to their employees. If your systems are such that a receipt must be identified by the total amount rather than the pump number, I recommend changing it to be in line with other Circle K's (or any other gas station's) system.; I went to put in gas only expecting to put in $10 at pump #8, swipt my card, and realized I didn't enter my fry vip #. I canceled out the transaction and swipt my card again. It declined my card. I went into the store to have the clerk help me.. my card declined again. I looked up why it declined. It took all of what I had in that card account which was $17.04.. It showed I had a zero balance, that I paid Shell gas $17.04, and I didnt even take the pump off the hook!!!! The clerk didn't care much, saying she works for circle k, not shell. Tryed called the manager today and apparently he should be there, but the gal hasn't heard from him.. I've been frauded, it doesn't matter if it wasn't alot of money. It's my money that I didn't spend!!!! I'm glad I didn't use my bank card.; She'll station is no longer Shell.
Phone number doesn't work.; Faulty pumps. Some of them will take your Fry’s VIP rewards and some wont. When I put my info in, it would show I have no points. Then I have to drive to another pump and put my info in again and the rewards show up. So if you know you have points in your account, double check at a different pump. It has been like that for months, but they don’t fix it."

They also charge for ice, they have multiple signs up saying ""no free ice"".

Especially if you expect to engage with staff who can communicate effectively, are competent and treat people of all races with dignity and respect.

See photo attached of the cashier who is incompetent with subpar communication skills.  the cashier cannot communicate a clear sentence to explain the basic function of the lottery machine. After I checked my lottery tickets using the large kiosk,  I approached the cashier as instructed by the kiosk to cash in the winning tickets as well as complete the purchase of $60 in gas.

However, the cashier refused to check the tickets and instructed me to obtain the amount of the winning ticket using the scanner attached to the lottery machine next to the register.  The cashier stated all other customer check their tickets using the scanner and tell the cashier the amount won.  After, I attempted to scan the tickets using the scanner which was not active or functioning,  I approached the counter again and told the cashier the total amount won was less than $100.  Then he states he could not check the tickets because the lottery machine next to the register was not active because the manager needed to complete the sign on or login process. Also, he would not empty his register to pay out the winnings.  Why would the cashier insist I scan tickets using a device connected to the lottery machine that is not active or functioning? And he knows he will not pay out the winnings?

the manager obviously knows the staff or cashier refuses to properly use the lottery machine.  Or lack the intellectual ability and capacity  to operate the machine.  it is 2pm in the afternoon, the lottery machine was not signed on and cashier cannot explain in simple words why he is unable to cash winning ticket worth $8.  instead the cashier communicated with an unclear and illogical response in a frustrated , hostile and aggressive manner towards the customer who made a simple and reasonable request.

After my experience with the lottery tickets, I decided to go to the Circle K on Elliot & Hardy to purchase $60 in gas and receive the $8 from the winning lottery tickets.  My experience at Circle K was 100% better.; This gas station has cleaned up in the last 8 month's

Repaired the tire for $20 and was back on the road in 15 minutes.; I went here about a year ago to get new tires, front brakes, and do a state inspection. Everyone was very polite, helpful, and informative. I got a fair price and was pretty happy.

Came back about a month ago for a tire rotation. The only reason I came back was because I couldn't get the front driver lug nut off myself without stripping it (could be from any number of things, but this garage was the last to tighten everything). I also needed to replace an O2 sensor that was right on the manifold. At the time I didn't have the tool to get it off, so I bought the part myself and just asked the garage to swap it for me.

In total I got charged over $150. $75 for the tire rotation because they put a new bolt on. Not only was the bolt issue likely their fault, the new one is the wrong size. They also charged $75 to swap the O2 sensor, something that likely took 2-3 minutes.

I realize now I should have just done the work myself instead of bringing it to these jabronis. I don't know if something changed over the last year, but I got waaay overcharged for some simple tasks. Don't be like me. Find another place to take your vehicle or learn to do it yourself.; In short, a very positive experience, quick response, super fast repair time, personable guy Mike, the mechanic.

Becareful; Worst customer service ever. They only care about business not people's feelings. I have been a customer for several years as I leave close by. Lately there is an older indian guy that is so rude and in my opinion a little racist. I went to get gas and the bill I gave him had some marker writing on it (I got that bill as changed like that somewhere else). He threw it back at me on the counter and said no and refused service. I was going to buy some chips too and he even returned that money. He did not even say sorry or asked if I had other means to pay. I was very hurt and shaken by how he treated me. Before this incident whenever I go to pay he sees me standing there at the window and makes me wait for a while before he addresses me. I am like ""hello"" and he does not even look at me. Then he will make eye contact and I pay for gas. I wish I could email customer service but I do not have their contact information. He is very rude to people who are brining business to the place. We should not have to be treated like that when we are just paying for gas. The station is in a good location and has reasonable prices but I am even scared to got there becuase this guy just refuses service for no reason really.; Very small, gas is little pricey!! Management can be interesting. Depending on the day!!.
Sometimes they can be engaging sometimes not. There is a young man there approximately 20. Very nice.  And the late night gentleman, who wear the green sweatjacket! Has a very good personality engaging as well!.  Prices inside are not to reasonable, but very clean.
The drinks in the store are. Reasonable.
Bathrooms are clean as well they are hospitable
As well as the store stays relatively clean. Thats ALWAYS a plus!!. I will warn that sometimes it can be crowded!. But 1 thru 10 i believe your experience will be pretty satisfactory.!; Swiped my card.  Pressed the 87 button. Gas started pumping but the $$ didn't match.  It defaulted to premium somehow even though I firmly pressed the 87 botton.  I immediately stopped the sale.  Made sure I grabbed the receipt too!!  To top it off...it wouldn't let me slide my card again so no gas for me!  First and last time I'll stop there.
It's rather uncool move and perhaps illegal as well.; The place may be OK but the attendant working there an hour ago (about 5:30pm) is not customer friendly.  When I submitted my lottery sheets one worked but the other didn't. Instead of saying something like: ""I'm sorry. It doesn't work but I suggest you fill out another."" He said: ""$2 bucks. The other doesn't work."" He did not even try to put it sideways. He was just monotonous and had to be coerced into trying again. He was just plain rude and crude."

Paul and his team have gone above and beyond to care for me and two cars over the past decade. They are friendly and work hard to share their knowledge, making sure you always know what's going on with your car and have the tools you need to make good decisions about keeping them maintained and updated. One thing to note -- the garage is open Mondays to Fridays, and the gas station is open Saturdays -- don't drop by on a Saturday if you need to get your car fixed up, although if you're fine with waiting, you can drop off the car on Saturday for work to be done on it starting Monday.; Have taken both of our vehicles to AB for the past 2 years, and always receive the best service. The entire team is great, nice, and insightful. Paul is always the best at answering questions and making sure you understand what is going on. Would trust them with anything. Good, honest people.; Great guys, helped me to fix my car for free when I’m driving from Chicago to New Jersey. I’m supposed to give this review in 2022 and I just found the card of AB marathon again while house shifting. They have great customer service and great people; Honesty about what it takes to fix your car without making stuff up!   I’ve been coming here for 20 years and I recently was reminded why again.  Paul is so professional and explains everything and is so very honest and with high quality and long lasting repairs to an old car.

There are plenty of pumps, so no waiting to fill up. Easy to get in and out of from right off the highway. The staff were friendly as well.; Was just called over the loud speaker to move my truck or it would be towed. The truck was parked at the forward line in front of the diesel pumps and I had been inside the store for less than 5 minutes. Absolutely terrible customer relations.; Stopped here for a break and a shower. There were still pieces of soap in the shower from the previous use so apparently they didn't clean the floors, and I had to clean it myself. Water pressure was good and water was hot. I overheard the cashier telling a driver that they were going to have to wait at least 10 minutes for someone to go out and clear out the reserved parking spots so that the driver could park. The cashier wasn't very friendly about it. Arby's was 24 hours which is nice because there were no other real food options at 10 at night.; This location not just like any other location workers over here they do above and beyond. Specially the cashier have name is Lisa. She’s an awesome, very helpful. I recommend this place to anybody at any time.
This location very clean; truck parking is okay and easy enough space to back in.,but wasrooms seats are old and very dirty., probably their staff is not taking care of cleanliness.,the seats were dirty and there were no toilet papers in 2-3 of their washrooms.."

Nothing special about them. Wouldn’t get your expectations too high. The wash was decent and the gentlemen noticed I had bugs on my bumper so he addressed that before taking it through the machines. I think the final touches when they go to dry the cars could be better. I think they should power wash their mops more frequently as that will cause swirl marks and scratches. I noticed they do change rags for drying when they go to dry off a car I just think they are rushing too quick and do not hit all the spots to dry off the car fully. Also wheels weren’t perfectly clean nor the car was perfectly dried off. I think they rush to the next car too fast and don’t 100% complete and analyze the car before they leave. The staff in the beginning has that attention to detail I think at the end is where they fail. So OVERALL if you have an average car who is looking to just get the car cleaned this place is  great. If you have a higher end vehicle and looking for a wash and like paying attention to the details this place would not be a great fit for you. Luckily I expected this and brought my own rags and tire shine and cleaned the remaining residue off my wheels and water spots. I attached some photos of what I am referring to with the dirt on the initial mop. I think if they changed a few things it could be excellent. Attention to details and more cleanliness as I know it is a production car wash, it could always be cleaner and perfected. Also if you are looking for a serious detail you go to a detail shop not a car wash. I will try it again in the future hopefully they have change these slight details to get me to a 5 stars; I recently gave this place a 5 stars review, unfortunate I had to removed it. I spoke to the owner and I complained to him that I'm paying for a interior and exterior cleaning, he keeps charging for both services because I have unlimited membership $65/Month and when is raining, he won't open the car wash for the whole day, why would I keep paying for an expensive service that I'm not receiving, he should fix the days that the car wash was not operating and REFUND customers their money that they were not able to use their services. He should keep someone who can clean the Interior and carpets, I'm a ride share driver and need to keep my ride clean for my clients and I just get very upset that I'm paying something very expensive and the owner is getting rich every single day because HE DOESNT PAY TO THE GUYS WHEN IS RAINING. You're just making yourself rich every day that is raining I guess you love when it rains. Also the car was machine is super dirty, that place needs a deep clean and power wash the floors that are in terrible conditions. The car wash has been closed for several days because it is BROKEN. ARE YOU GOING TO REFUND MY MONEYYYYY??????????????????????; I use this car wash regularly and have never had the problems that I had today
They were obviously short-staffed however they did not clean my mats and when I asked for my mats to be cleaned all I kept being told was how I should get a detail
It was very frustrating and I don't know if I will come back again; Fletcher's is a real home-town service station, a great resource to have nearby!  They are always ready to help.  I recently needed my alternator replaced and was very happy with their communication and fair price.; Worlds best service station
They have FREE Air
They have TWO always clean bathrooms
They have two cashiers who are always happy and helpful where most places only have one!
I drive way out of my way to buy gas from them and am happy to do it!

Get gas there when you can!; This is a full service station. They can pump your gas if necessary and also fix anything that's wrong with your car. Easy in and out for any kind of vehicle.; This is the only station in our region that sells Highway #2 Diesel without Biofuel vegetable oil.
Most stations in Illinois including major brand Interstate truck stops have only been selling Biofuel Diesel (5 to 25% biofuel).
Diesel engine manufacturers (Mercedes Benz) will not honor warranty service for engine damage due to use of BioDiesel exceeding 5%.

They recently changed ownership and staff, but I thought I would give them a try since the location is so convenient, so I took my car in for a routine oil change. The mechanic gave me a list of about $1,400 worth of other issues he found—there was a leak in the oil pan (which I had noticed but thought it was minor) and the check engine light wouldn’t turn off (an issue that I told him the car dealership itself couldn’t fix and said wasn’t really a problem), among other things. I didn’t think anything was very urgent, but the district manager of the shop guaranteed the repairs for at least a year, so I told them to go ahead. One week later, the oil leak had gotten worse and the check engine light was back on. I tried to get in touch with the district manager, but after repeated calls and leaving my number at the desk, I still didn’t hear back.
I took my car back to be repaired again. When I picked it up the second time, my car made a strange rattling noise when I accelerated. I went right back to the shop and the mechanic worked on it for half an hour and offered me a quick test drive to let me check if it was okay. I tried to ask what he thought had happened, he said we should make sure it was fixed, then he’d explain. So I drove around for about ten minutes and went back to get an explanation on what had happened, but I found that the mechanic and the cashier had locked up for the night and gone home.
Weeks later, the leak still hasn’t been fixed and I have yet to hear back from the distract manager about his false promises. I have wasted entirely too much time and money at this shop. Nothing will convince me to return, and I recommend you save yourself the frustration and find another shop.; Bad experience at this station, when attempting to get my car washed. It took a very long time due to it continually stopping and malfunctioning. It never rinsed my car off properly. This happened to me once before, resulting in my car not getting rinsed off. It just stopped after the soap was applied. That time, the attendant agreed to bring buckets of water out and rinsed it off that way; at least I was treated with respect then. This time I was treated with such disrespect when I brought the problem to their attention. They basically denied there was a problem, and did nothing about it. No refund, no offer for another free wash, no apology, just implications I don't know what I'm talking about. I've owned cars for over forty years, and have been through countless car washes, so I certainly can determine when one is not functioning. Quite insulting. The  car repair shop next door is GREAT, on the other hand!  They are called All Stars. I would highly recommend them!  They are not directly associated with the gas station, I don't think.  My negative review has to do with those who run the gas pumps, car wash, and the store inside.; I called up to see if they could look at a leaking tire and they said to come right over. I drove over and they took me right away. An old plug in my tire was leaking and they replaced it with a new plug and some sealant for $25.

These reviews are over a year old. Give them a chance. They are under new ownership.; Brought my car in because it was leaking a little coolant, and I couldn't figure out where it was coming from.  They diagnosed the problem as a leak in the heater core, and when I got the car back the leak was gone. I took it back in a few days later because my heat no longer worked and they told me that they couldn't find the exact location of the leak either, so they bypassed the heater core altogether."

Jackie was incredible when explaining the current specials to me. She was patient, clear, and made sure I understood all the details, which helped me take full advantage of the offers available.

At checkout, Michael continued this trend of exceptional service. He was efficient and very helpful, ensuring the process was smooth and pleasant. It's rare to encounter such a dedicated and friendly team, and it truly made my visit to Speedway a positive one. I'll definitely be returning for both the great deals and the fantastic customer service.; The question here is why??
Such a clean modern accommodating store.... But there's no business??
This is a perplexing.

Could it be that you all just don't have a welcome attitude??; I was waiting outside with 4-5 people outside and none of us can even get a cup of coffee from 10pm-5/6 a cause This place is always closed 90% of the night. I do not recommend this place at all..; I realize that I have to drive out of my way to go to a Speedway gas station in South Florida, so when I spotted the only Speedway along Biscayne Blvd./US-1 on the drive home, I stopped in to get a ginger ale.

This Speedway location is large and has similar prices and promotions as the other locations. You can purchase hot & cold beverages, snacks, candy, beer, lottery, cigarettes, and many more. The items are neatly organized; and there's an area that looks like a small café where the hot breakfast & lunch sandwiches, pizza slices, hot dogs, and roller grill items are made. If you have a Speedway Rewards card, you can earn points on purchased items and redeem them towards various rewards such as free beverages or food, points, or gift cards.; This location has the worst service ever they conduct business like it's their back yard BBQ. Evrrytime i go there the store floor is always dirty no food prepared during particular employees shifts. The manager gives bad energy with her daughter in law disrespect customer continues pretend like they care but it show disrespect to customer. By careless attitude within employees. The night shifts do and say whatever within company hours of business. Lock doors anytime of the day. Very disrespectful black guy working overnight. I've witnessed several times of kicking customers out I have video them. Unprofessional manner. The store manager act as she's not the problem. Hiring ghetto ppl. That's why the store has high theft problem. That store will never reached its highest potential if you continue to have that store manager. I can say a lot more but at this point it doesn't matter never walking in that store again 👎 bad service bad employees"

The customer service, is outstanding and attentive to they customer. I highly recommend everyone to go to Sunoco gas⛽ they service is excellent👌 by 👑 KIN'Z Pro.® @KINzpro; Horrible customer service. Laura the gas station attendant was working the counter when I simply requested change to put air in my tires. She insisted that I had to
buy something to get change. I immediately requested to speak to the supervisor. Apparently she was the only one working there! No supervision whatsoever! She said I had to return at 7 AM to speak with the manager. Then she said that they don’t own the air pump. So services anybody can anything on their property? It makes sense since the gas station had only ONE car pumping gas as opposed to every other gas station filled due to the 5 o’clock post-work rush. I should’ve known better too! This is probably the only gas station in modern times that does not accept contactless payment either! I took a chance and IMMEDIATELY was reminded why I stopped coming here. I’m here at the Valero down the street where they GLADLY accepted my change with a smile on their face and I proceeded to put air in my tires because thankfully in AMERICA we have options if you don’t provide good customer service. She doesn’t even speak English. Not only that but she assumed I spoke Spanish. If you speak English only DO NOT GO HERE!; I had an incredibly frustrating experience at this Sunoco gas station recently. As I was getting gas, the staff changed shifts and locked the doors, trapping me and several other customers inside the store. We were stuck there for over 15 minutes, with no explanation or apology from the staff.

To make matters worse, once the staff finally let us out, they rushed us out of the store and were extremely rude and dismissive. It was clear that they were more concerned with getting home than providing good customer service.

Overall, I would not recommend this Sunoco to anyone. The lack of communication and disregard for customer safety is unacceptable, and the poor attitude of the staff only added insult to injury. Save yourself the hassle and go somewhere else for your gas needs. One star is far too generous for this kind of experience.; The lady that work in the morning is very rude and is unprofessional. Always on the phone and never charge the same price on items its like she making her own prices every time . And the Haitian guy is always on the phone and treat ppl very rudely.  I would fire both of them . The rest of the staff are good ppl but mainly the guy that works the graveyard shift is the nicest and more professional of them all. Also since he has been working the graveyard shift the gas station stays open because everyone would go to sleep and lock the door and wouldn't be able to get any service. I would have the employee's go thru training to better there customers service skills because the lady in the morning and the Haitian guy are the worst.; Only speak Spanish guy keep hanging up because he gave me a “refund “ i never got . I called to let him know I’m coming back he keep hanging up in my face . Like I’m obligated to speak Spanish . I will be coming in with my receipt and check the camera he took the lollipop back from my son that i gave and said refund will go back he was rushing me he didn’t even correctly refund me"

My group and I have been loyal customers for over six years, during which we have never encountered any issues or conflicts. However, on this occasion, we were met with disrespectful and unprofessional behavior from a new employee.

Feeling compelled to address the situation, I requested to speak with Manager, given our direct relationship. Regrettably, I was disheartened to find that instead of addressing our concerns, she opted to side with the new employee, who had only started last week & doesn’t know anything about customer service apparently. This approach was both unexpected and unprofessional.

As a result of this experience, my team and I have collectively decided to discontinue our patronage at your establishment. We value professionalism and respect in all our interactions, and we feel that this standard was not upheld during our recent visit.

Not sure why she refused my card. Ultimately it’s more work for her to count back change or turn upset customers away. I’ve been a cashier before and I loved when someone just wanted to swipe a card because it was less for me to do

-3 Stars; I found out about this 76 Gas Station about a year ago when I moved from North Raleigh to Morrisville. I go there mainly for lottery tickets and gas but I do get their coffee on my days off and it’s pretty good. They also have a grill for breakfast and lunch and their breakfast biscuits and sandwiches are very good but I have yet to eat lunch there. It can get very busy there in the morning but doesn’t take them long to get your biscuit made.
The morning staff are very friendly with a down-home southern hospitality! The evening staff are nice to oh but they’re definitely not as busy in the evenings.
I can imagine the lunch crowd is probably busy too if the food is as good as it is at breakfast.
Hours of Operation are not posted on Google maps but sign on window states they are open from 6AM to 11PM, 7 days-a-week.; Ive been here a few times now, and the food never disappoints. I’m starting to make it a routine almost. The customer service is great, they always welcome you with a smile. It’s expedient, so not a long wait at all. Like I said earlier you can taste the time, patience, and love in every bite. Highly Recommend!!; They were great and friendly for a moment but then when one day they found out I was trans they are transphobic constantly. Approached a clerk about it and he was still disrespectful. Sad because they’d be a great service if they respected LGBT but now I have to take my money to the Sheetz a few blocks away. And gladly do it.; Don't be fooled this is no ordinary gas station

Inside you will find a secret breakfast and lunch kitchen where you can get above average breakfast and lunch food

Given we aren't talking Restaurant style it is better than fast food and it is made fairly quick .....

Customer service is excellent

I recommend any communications and Electrician techs take a pit stop for breakfast or lunch

Customer service brings customers back

I have marked as favorite so that I dont pass by without a quick bite to eat"

Extremely overpriced !

And horrible quality food.

I am a huge fan of meatloaf, it is literally one of my favorite things to eat.

This was the worst I’ve ever had, and it was far from meatloaf.

When I brought the food back to show them, the woman behind the counter, looked at me and said “what do you want me to do about it?”

My response was “you know what, nothing I guess I’ll never be back here again “

Her response was “suit yourself” .

Never again

My son sandwich was so hard and disgusting that we ended up throwing the food in the trash before we left .

Horrible experiences this one was the last that will ever give.; I've stopped here numerous times in my 14 plus years. But the young black lady that was working the Subway was the best I've ever been greeted and served. Her professionalism was the best I've seen in a long LONG time in food service. Glad they are people that still do their job 100 plus percent; Super nice and clean Loves. Also, they carry my brand and flavor of dip, so there is a big plus. Fairly easy on and easy of of interstate 85 north or south. Has a subway and McDonald's on property. Staff was great and bathrooms were clean.

Thanks!!!; I frequent this gas station often and it’s typically pretty good. Today the cashier was GREAT. I purchased multiple bags of ice and she quickly pulled around 2 hand trucks to help me load them into my vehicle. When I rounded the corner with an empty hand truck, she had one waiting for me loaded and ready to go.

Not only do I want to rave about the food there, but the people that work there. You don't know what kind of impact you can have on somebody by just being kind.. I explained to the gal behind the register that I didn't know what I wanted I told her what I liked and she suggested a quesadilla I told her I wasn't a big fan of peppers and she was kind enough to keep them off to the side for me. And the girl behind the register who rang me up was patient with me while I was entering my phone number and using my points. And when she asked me if I'd like a bag I expected her to just hand it to me across the counter but she literally walked all the way around to hand me my food.. everybody there is very kind and sweet. And I know you're probably thinking well that's their job but as of lately and honestly since pandemic customer service has been in the toilet everywhere you go. People are entitled and they don't feel like they have to go the extra so I wanted to make sure I gave a shout out so that the manager or owner of this place knows that he has some real quality people there. Good on you for your staff. Like I said I've been going through a lot of things lately and it meant a lot to me for people to just smile be kind and not be dismissive.; This is the worst and rudest speedway I've ever been to The lady asked me what kind of gas I wanted I told her regular she charged me for premium I went back in to let the manager know and he told me it's not my problem dude and then I said well you don't have to get rude with me he goes well then you can leave and he swiped my stuff off the counter and said to go. I just stood there staring at him in disbelieved and he said are you done do you have any further problems because I can meet you outside.  I probably spend $10,000 a year there I'm never going back.
The manager in there is the rudest jerk I've ever been around. Really you're going to take me outside and fight me.; I asked the cashier to speak to a manager and when she came out she was absolutely the most rude person I’ve come across. Horrible customer service here very unprofessional and unpleasant experience 0 stars.

Did I mention the bathrooms were sweeter than the immaculate reception?; You have abandoned vehicles parked in parking spots with no one in them you have people who have not paid for paid parking. The staff a lazy and disrespectful. Not coming back here ever. In my opinion. Customer service is important. Being rude and disrespectful and taking your customer's comments out of context just to make an excuse not to do your job is laziness. Customer service is important. Because of this in my opinion the lack of customer service the fact that you have abandoned vehicles parked in parking spots people have not paid the park and nothing being done about helping customers who have paid to park I rated a two-star. For the rudeness the willingness to take a customer's words out of context and for not servicing a paying customer. In my opinion that's why I lowered it to two I would have lowered it more but the facilities are clean they are not terrible. I also left another star because I have not tried the food so therefore I'm assuming it's good. you got three strikes because of the rudeness the lack of customer care for a paying customer and the fact that you're allowing vehicles to be stored on your property that are not in paid parking areas. I can understand an individual pain to store their vehicle in a reserved spot but I cannot understand why you're allowing people to store their bobtails in a full semi truck free parking area.; Showers are great. Store is good. Parking is confusing, cannot drop your trailer so you can go to the grocery store but you can abandon your truck in parking spots and non-parking spots. They need to give some business to the local wrecker operator to free up some parking spots.; You can say it’s a local parking place, not a truck stop… Showers were clean, store is ok but parking place is a mess. I don’t blame only them, the Truckers have their contribution too.; I’m giving them 3 stars only because the staff is a ALLOT off the radar.

By far the worst store ever! Out of let's say 9 to 10 pumps on 3 work on the semi side! The cashier's only spoke to the people they knew. I was going to say something nice about the showers, but mines kept getting hotter and hotter because the handle was turning by itself. The grounds needs a street sweeper to go over it 1 good time. Good luck with the McDonald's, they only have half the items on the menu.  Also while I was sitting there a customer brought back in a burrito that was still frozen solid.... lmao Jackson, Mississippi is not the move!!!!!; I'm in shower 3 and this is not acceptable. I get that things get old but there is no excuse for things being broken and dirty. The lock on the door is broken, the toilet paper holder has been ripped off the wall and the floor is filthy. And a used soaking wet wash clothe was left in the shower. Absolutely disgusting. Poor management is the only explanation for this. Do better; Reserved a shower and when I arrived to the bathroom..it was dirty and hadn't been cleaned. Mold on ceiling..not so good customer service. Two stars for available gas pumps & being greeted by the cashier. This location also has a tire shop  ""GoodYear""; Place needs a face-lift. Always long lines for fuel. There's a McDonald's on site. For some reason There's always smoke not really visible but you can smell it coming from McDonald's. Makes you want to gag. The people are friendly enough but there never seems to be enough people working. Always only 1 cashier.; There is nothing more stressful for a professional driver than arriving at a Pilot, after 11 hours driving and finding that the shower application does not work, the person who assists you at the cashier has the worst attitude and desire to work in the world. And you also have to wait in line at a ""salon"" to say something, without even having any idea how long it will take to be able to take a bath!
I was waiting for someone to tell me if I would finally get a shower, I went to laundry room and found “shower guy” playing on his phone. Funny!
The pilot in general is very dirty, and sewer water everywhere, even in the diesel pumps, you have to cross over the water to get in the shop, everything smells very bad. If you can pass by, turn and stay on the Flying better."

Rude and delusional workers.
I pulled up and I said give me a moment, I’m transferring the money. He walks away to help other customers.

He sits down for a second before I could get his attention.
He told me next time make my transfer before arriving.

Then he turns around to the other employee to talk shit in arabic.

When he was done pumping my gas, there were dead slow. No cars.

Guy rushed me for absolutely no reason.; I can't tell if it's the same build and has been significantly remodeled or if it's a new building, but I used to work at Grampys in the early 2000s and that building was extremely haunted. I felt like I was being watched all night, and I was attacked by an unseen entity in the back room. That was scarier then when I got robbed at knife point. I feel sorry for anybody who works alone over night there. Also the little patch of woods behind it is any better.; Not open 24 hours like it says and everything here is expensive; Walked into the store. Everything was looking good. I wanted a quick breakfast not expecting much. They had donuts, muffins, coffee, and fountain drinks. I went to go grab a muffin and donut but there was no bags. So I asked. No big deal. As I went to grab them they felt old. It is what it is. I went to go get a drink. No cups in site. I asked. They keep them behind the counter. I go to get some lemonade. It's all out. So I get a different drink. I buy a couple things. And leave. My buddy also bought some donuts and a coffee. We leave. I take one bit out of the donut. Stale as can be. Luckily I found a donut dip near by. My buddy walks in and tells me that the donut he bought has mold on it. Luckily he saw it before eating it. I will never go back there again; Horrible !! Hate going to this store ! They are rude , horrible customer service , and they complain if you pay with change !! Which is AMERICAN MONEY . The Guy at the register  wasn’t trying to take my money. They are racist the only good person is the women who works there !!! 2 employees give issues to everyone who comes in which is usually the fat guy that’s the “manager” and the skinny guy that’s usually there with him are horrible and definitely won’t recommend I have seen it personally how they treat the customers.  I would be reporting this issue to the state and I will personally talk to owner of the store.  Because this is not right !!!"

I have never had a problem in the past 8 years that I've been going to this particular location. I've always been very polite and courteous to the employees and other customers. BUT... last night I am at the this location and it about 11:45pm give or take a minute or 2. The doors to the store are closed because there about to do shift change. BUT there is an employee taking customers out the walk-up window. When it was my turns I began to ask the man if they had a Particular Doritos And while I'm Speaking he then cuts me off and with a hugh attitude tells me He's not doing Huge Shopping order !!! So I then look at him with a very Confused look on my face.. I then proceeded to tell him that I Only want two bags of chips and a Gatorade Really  ???? The employee looks at me and then with a cocky attitude start to tell me that I can wait till 12:00pm after their shift change !!! Now I didn't do anything to this man but ask him a question.  I didn't deserve to be treated this way.. So I then take my phone out to record my interaction with this guy cause I had a bad feeling that he was going to escalate the situation and try and make it worse.  That's exactly what he did. He kept coming to the window trying to antagonize me. BUT it didn't work out like that cause I kept my cool and let this employee continue to make a fool of himself and he may potentially lose his job now..Sometimes you don't know what people are going through in life and you shouldn't just take your anger out on someone you don't know...; Literally every spot was taken so I parked at a gas pump just to run in and grab my Dunkin order. I'm disabled. The cashier yelled at me and said I can't park at a pump to come pick up an order. There's like 20 gas pumps. I'm pretty sure I'm there's enough pumps to let me park there for one minute. I will not spend one cent here or give them my business after their rudeness. I'll go to Pride gas station. Oh and another thing, pand handlers outside harrass you and a homeless guy is always passed out on the floor.; Got there at 1145 the doors were locked said there closed till 12 for shift change. Waited then they stayed closed. Waited another 15 min and 3 people walked out.. went to go in and was told still have to wait it's shift change.. crazy they can just stand in there one them filing there nails not opening.. people need to do there job or something should be done crazy. Then heard they always do it by someone else who was walking up then turned and left cause he said they will sit there for while; Nice clean little store that carries a cool variety of things.

And definitely don’t treat customers with disdain and contempt because you are unhappy with your own choices in life.; I couldn't get one of my credit cards to work at the pump so I had to use my debit card instead. Gas prices seem pretty fair considering a lot of gas stations are much higher price; The owners have no shame.  This place is always dirty and smelly.  No heat or A/C in the store.

Discounts for BJ’s club members only. BJ’s club card /ID must be scanned before the payment method. Average gas station accommodates most vehicles. Lines are not terrible but if you are there during rush hours mostly afternoons and evenings then it gets busy.This gas station is beside BJ’s wholesale club(Berlin/Hudson).; It's like all the other BJ's gas places, which is a great place to get gas at the lowest price. However, this one has one man who spends a lot of time outside helping with transactions, and so is not approving yours, so you can stand awhile just waiting on him to approve your purchase of gas. (They need to hire another to be with him  in the small office there on site to approve purchases when they come up. Which is like other BJ's I have been too.); The positives to this place are the great gas prices and the extra long hoses. Besides that, there are some problems that make it a middle of the road stop.

Location is great if you’re going to BJs. Aside from that it’s a pain to access. I get that this made sense in the development of Highland Commons, but a location not on top of the hill would’ve been better if possible. Though, coincidentally, it does contain the next issue.

Long wait times and miserable people. Staff seem great, so don’t take this as me knocking them. They’re doing their best and I see it when I visit. However wait times can be atrocious here as at any other BJs location. The biggest culprit behind this is a convoluted and slow debit/credit card processing system and slow pumps. The card system often has attendants running out to assist older and elderly customers, and generally takes about 20-40 seconds to authorize cards. Debit cards seem to cause the most problems so use a credit card if you’ve got one. The shoppers here can also be quite miserable at times and they have no problem taking out there frustrations on other customers. We all try to wait patiently while getting our gas, but it helps when people can organize their vehicles in an orderly fashion.

Very often I see folks not using the extended pump hoses and causing extensive lines for their preferred pump. This snowballs into longer lines and often times empty pumps. Then people get impatient, try to move around, and lose to someone else that got through the mess and saved themselves 15 minutes by using the extra long hose. If people could just think rationally, this could all be so much quicker for everyone.; Card wasn’t working at the gas pump, several attempts made, same issues. They got new card scanners which are problematic, and I tried multiple cards (work elsewhere one is newly issued). Told me to see cashier who I told him it wasn’t working. Guy rudely told me to go back to the pump. I asked if he could run the cars he refused and then turned around ignoring me. Zero customer service and just a miserable individual. Honestly questioning my membership going forward if these are the types of people they hire.; Multiple pumps were broken without notice. Payment systems did not work at all and when I tried to pay the attendent was very rude. Will be canceling my membership since the employees want me to spend my money elsewhere. Unacceptable."

Edited: I'm writing this edit because I couldn't find a way to answer your replay (but people should know who you are). You are a liar:
1) we never had talk regarding price, because I'm always changing oil for 30-40$, It's regular price, I never asked you, (that was my mistake), I was hurry and just asked you if you are free.
2) There was not any service light in my car. I'm changing oil every 5K mile, service light comes out on 7K. Oil change service reset, you could do just holding one button on the stearing wheel. there is no need to connect any computer, and god knows what you did there.

They don’t have no compassion
They only care about the money.
How can you fix a car and tell say it’s the battery, the battery was new not even 4 months, they didn’t even contact you to tell you the car needs anything they just call you and ask for money, and tell you they fixed this and that right there, this is illegal, Malpractice. So wrong. The worst is after they said the car was fixed,
the next day the same thing happened, and told you it was something else.

Really nice people!; Took my car for an inspection.  Nice guys in the shop.  Enjoyed chatting with the owner while I waiting for the inspection to be completed.  It actually needed a blinker…..which they were able to replace onsite for me at a very reasonable price.

I imagine that the bulk of the new store can be transported in chunks which snap together easily once the land has been dug to shape and leveled for use. Endele! Arriba!; Circle K gas station, where the concept of selling gas seems to be more of a suggestion than a reality. If you're on the hunt for that elusive liquid gold to fuel your vehicle, well, good luck. This place is the embodiment of irony—it's called a gas station, yet it never seems to have any gas!

I mean, seriously, what's the deal? It's like they decided selling gas wasn't part of the job description. You'd have better luck finding a mermaid riding a unicorn than finding a drop of fuel at this establishment. Might as well rename it to ""Circle Nope, We're Out of Gas—K.""

In conclusion, if you enjoy the thrill of embarking on a gas hunt every time you stop by a gas station, Circle K is your destination. One star for making the simple act of buying gas feel like a game of hide-and-seek with no chance of winning. Bravo for redefining the concept of a gas station! 🚗🔍; With all things considered. This gas station is a small gas station with highly overworked employees that usually have to deal with multiple people, from multiple places, with multiple ""Personalities"" for a lack of better words. They are human and go through more than most understand. Like Barbara, Skylar, and John to name a few. Who always try to keep good energy and positivity. I've witnessed them trying to brighten the mood of a customer, by showing excellent service or trying to put a smile in their face. Instead people respond with aggression and hostility. That kind of response can cause people to be jaded. It may not be the Ritz-Carlton,  but thus store is home to me because of the people who work there. Thank you; I go here multiple times a week, for the most part it’s okay but you always have like 1 employee working and when she takes her breaks she has to shut the store down because no one else is there. Really inconvenient for people who are just trying to grab a drink or get gas real quick, especially for people who are on a time limit. The store always seems dirty and the floor is sticky most days. Outside of the store is dirty and the curb appeal is not there, seems super ghetto. Most times your machines to put your phone number don’t work. Over all it is okay just needs some changes to make it better"

When she did appear out of the bathroom,  20 minutes later,  I asked her why she couldn't put bathroom duties aside for the 15 minutes so she could help 6 customers waiting! Then the cashiers friend told me, if i didn't want to wait 25 minutes to get smokes, I should go to another store. (Which I had to do the night before as there was no cashier at Murphys) The friend continued to go back and forth because she didn't think I could hear her say that,  but yes,  I certainly did! The friend continued into the store with us,  still yelling at me, because I became deaf for a moment? I heard it very loud and clear!  Then she stood right behind me just to get in my space, and i asked the friend to step back!  The cashier then said she's a customer, too?  So that gives her the right to get in my space after a confrontation?  She was just trying to egg it on.
I have been going to this Murphys since it opened.  Most of the cashiers know exactly what I get every time! They are the nicest people. So, is this a convenience store?  The friend told me I have no idea what her friend goes thru working there.  Well then, don't work there! And why is the friend telling me off?  I did confront the cashier for answers,  but not the friend.
The disrespect,  time consuming,  encounter really wasn't necessary, I'm so shocked at people these days.; Gas prices are usually cheapest in town on top of the amazing customer service. Had a brown hair cashier recommend the B2G1 for the big redbulls instead of the 2 for 5 small ones. I only had $7 bucks, I'm a college student working full time so I'm broke and always needing caffeine 🤣 thank you so much for covering the rest past $7! You guys rock :); Your pumps refuse to accept tap to pay and when I walked in the inside the kid saw me walking towards the registrator and ducked in the back room. I will take my business elsewhere.; I usually love the lower prices here but tonight an employee was smoking outside on the east side of the building about 15 feet from gas pumps and the entrance to the shop. County health says that smoking should be 25' away from any entrance of a building where smoking is prohibited. I stopped filling up my tank smelling a combination of gas fumes and the employee's cigarette.; I came to pay for my stuff and gas. The cashier was short with me and seemed like she was annoyed and in a bad mood. She didn't ask if I had a rewards phone number and seemed like I was taking too long to pull my debit card out. I love the other Murphy gas stations/cashiers. But terrible customer service makes for a poor experience."

I was informed it was policy, but I have not had that issue at any other Love's. I travel the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This was by far the worst customer service I have received. My $20 was in the machine, and it would not let me play my Powerball. By the time the machine was reset, it was too late to play, costing me my chance to win. Then the manager made me buy a scratch-off ticket. He said, ""I'll just give you your $20 back,"" and walked away with the ticket he chose. So I just asked for it to get out. At first, he said no, then I said, ""My money! Give me my ticket!"" He hesitated and then did. I left, but the store was disgusting. So if the staff can't do the lottery so they have more time, they failed.

I needed to get refueled, and I wanted to give something to eat, so I decided to try one of their sandwiches. As well as some fruit.

Happened 9/11 around 6pm
I paid money in cash for the gas and one of the employees (African American lady) forgot to put me in the system or something.

I asked her what happened, and she said there is nothing on the system. Very soon she starts to blame me and treat me unfairly.

I really do not understand.
The store was not busy and I gave her money in person less than like 3 minutes ago. How she can forgot that?

I feel very bad for her and she really needs to go to hospital.

Now, I am thinking that she did it on purpose.
She intended to do that because she could rip off non-English people.; Came in yesterday to get gas and they didn't have any which okay I get it but none of the pumps were marked till ppl went in to complain. Now this evening I tried calling 4 times to find out if they have gas yet and each call was picked up and hung up not a hello nothing.

I mean I get it you got to charge me for the cup but come on really and I brought in my own cup too. I'm not understanding why I got charged $4. The cashier told me that their manager told them to charge a cup of ice like I was getting a fountain drink.; I had recently been frequenting this store on basically a daily basis to grab a large ice coffee. I was staying at a hotel nearby for work and I actually like their ice coffee. Probably went by around 10x in the past two weeks. Today I walked in and it was a lady with braided hair that I had interacted with on several occasions. I walked over to the cups and noticed the first three up front to be pulled were visually dirty, so I pulled them out and grabbed the 4th. As I was grabbing them I heard ""You have to pay for that."" While I heard it, it didn't register in my head that she was referring to me. I turned around to get the coffee and she was standing ahead of me and said it again. I looked at her with probably the dumbest look on my face but had a mask and hat on which isn't my norm, as I paused in confusion because I hve been coming here on nearly a daily basis and did exactly as I have done everytime I've walked through tha door. I replied to her ""Do you not recognize me?"" She then asked me to pull my mask down, which I complied, and you could see a little bit of shock on her face when she realized it was me, which I kind of understand. I just checked out and was literally about to drive to CA. I was wearing basic shorts and a shirt with mask and hat. Here's the problem and where I'm highly insulted and will never return here again. I heard them say this to one couple, one time, the entire time I went here. Why did they say it to them? It was obvious they were from the immediate neighborhood and possibly transient. Why was this said to me this time? Because I didn't dress up to check out of my hotel room and drive for four hours? It's obvious why. She profiles those who look poor and assumes they are going to steal it. I told her how insulting her actions were and left without completing the trasaction.
I didn't complain last week when I walked in and the same dried up mocha drip drop on the iced coffee dispenser was still there 24 hours later, the same exact shape and all. I didn't complain three days ago when I purchased a slim jim, which was a norm for me with my coffee, it had expired in March of 2022 .... Half a year ago. I didn't get mad yesterday when the ATM was having communication errors with the vendor and wouldn't process my withdrawal of $200. That clerk did offer to pull from the cash register but could only do $40. I didn't complain when the gentlemen who works swing shift everytime insisted on grabbing my mobile phone to scan my membership barcode instead of being respectful of others private property that cost $1.4k two months ago instead of simply lifting the 6"" scanner and pointing it at the screen, which was already in place to do so, all while in a pandemic, not wearing gloves and who knows the last time his hands were washed.
And I didn't complain a few nights ago when the clerk had the door locked for 10+ minutes, to which I gave up and went elsewhere.
Thanks for the insulting experience!; Lady up front was super nice, and told me about the deals on the energy drinks, didnt need 4 but it was still super nice of her to tell me"

Conveniently located on your way out of town off of US highway 285 going to New Mexico. I do believe this is your last fuel stop before you do get to New Mexico.; A few years ago, I was on a road trip.  Running on fumes, I planned to get gas in Antonito.  Finding out there was none was like sitting down on a toilet when the seat is up.  Not cool.

Well, that's fixed now.  A great, clean, modern station with a grille and everything.  While staying in Antonito, I got a cheeseburger for lunch more than once, and it was plenty good.  I look forward to a time when the grille is open every day, or at least every weekday.  It seems that government policies have put labor in short supply just about everywhere.; I've started coming here in the middle of my work day when I want lunch just because of their cleanliness and mask protocols. I appreciate other businesses that are committed to keeping our small community safe. (Plus their grill is actually really fantastic.); My employment wasn't valued. I wasnt valued, their supervisor barks orders at you like a dog and if you happen to forget because they have you finishing and completely about 1000 other tasks, she snitches you out without even bringing it to your attention first. The manager picks and chooses her favorites, fired me for not sweeping and mopping the floors, but they were swept and mopped. If they ever bothered to look at the cameras when it's necessary they probably woulda seen that I did. Very unprofessional when firing took place, said one complete sentence to me as I was walking out and that was it. You couldn't even bother to bring me in your office, sit me down, and talk to me face to face, you said one sentence too me and walked away. Senaida and the rest of the Cordova family are by far the worst business owner's in this town, this business does not know how to treat employees or customers, unless its convenient for them. They're supposedly about cleanliness but have sooo many place in the kitchen that have never been cleaned since they opened, it was truly disgusting. They want you to deep clean the kitchen on the weekends when they are supposedly closed, but they really arent it's just their grill that's not on. Like how do you want me to deep clean the kitchen n still tend to customers who want food, mainly hamburgers?? You want me to get down on my hands and knees and scrub the floor, but your over there frying fries in the deep fryer, getting oil everywhere n I just cleaned that spot. Contradicting much!

After trying the pump, it did not work to accept a credit card. I asked the clerk, a young man, to put a sign on the pump that it doesn't work. He replied that his supervisor would not allow that. I tried another pump, it accepted my card, but when I started the pump, it would not erase the prior charge, so that if I pumped it would charge me for the prior transaction. The clerk ignored the issue. This place is incompetently and/or dishonestly run. I will never stop here again.; Always treated politely and courteously and have had on multiple occasions had staff go out of their way to give me an exceptional customer experience.

Really helped me get back on the road in time to return to Iowa and saved me from having to tow it back home. Really appreciate him helping me out and being so fast.; What an experience we had!  I was heading north to go camping, traveling past Salida, my steering brace on my land cruiser failed and sheered away from the frame. I called just about every mechanic I could find in Salida and Buena Vista. Of course it had to be 4:30pm on a Friday.  After getting turned down by many shops and service centers.  I called Ron with little hop left.  He answered and said bring it down to the shop.  After getting towed to his shop, he had gotten the chassis pulled back together and framed up before we came back with pizza and beers. We ended up driving another 500 miles after the repair including some serious off roading trails.  The fix held up with no problems.  Ron, I seriously can't thank you enough!; I have a 2018 GMC with a duramax that is no longer covered under warranty. I recently had a failure with part of the turbo system on it. Fortunately I found Ron at Diesel Dawg. He took my call and quickly gave me an appointment. Ron is awesome, friendly, knowledgeable, and reasonably priced. He really cares about his customers. I reluctantly recommend him only because I don't want him to get too busy for the rest of his regular customers.; I had stopped by and spoken to Ron last year about a small issue with my truck which is a bit of an issue sometimes as I have installed a 6.7 Cummins in my 2009 Ford F350. Ron was very knowledgeable and we quickly fixed the problem.  Just before Memorial Day I again was traveling through the area and was having a different electrical issue that was effecting my tach, causing it to move all over the place and just drop to zero at random times while driving.  I called Ron to see if he could squeeze me in and Ron stated he was swamped and would not be in over the holiday weekend which I can't blame him as family should always come first in my opinion.  However, Ron listened as I explained the issue and narrowed down the problem and gave me a fix over the phone. I did as he suggested and it took less than 5 mins and was simple to do.  It's been weeks and thousands of miles and I haven't had a problem yet. Ron is one of the best diesal mechanics I have ever come across and I highly recommend his shop...I highly suggest you make a reasonable appointment if you need work done as it is obvious everyone in the area knows Ron is the best out there. Thanks Ron for helping me out and I'll plan to stop by on my way back through in the fall."

As a black man I was made to bag up all my own items,when serval times I came they did so., the lady clerk refused to bag it up. Then made be buy a wine after I was told they open it for me then refuse to do so. I had to wait for a male(who was very helpful)employee to help me. The women are very racist towards black people and I will never tell anyone I know to shop here.; I visited this convenience store four times.  3xs between Thursday and Friday; and once on Saturday.  It wasn't until Saturday my 4th that I was proffered a bag to carry 8+ items. By Friday, it became a sort of stand-off between me and the same stalwart old lady at the counter... with the dyed or fake brownish hair. Would she finally offer me a ""paper or plastic"" or would I need to awkwardly ask if she thought it possible that I receive one. She's not currently undefeated.

No matter who was manning the counter, there were always at least six people behind the counter, with one register open despite the length of the patrons standing in line.  The rest??? Somewhere between eating the food prepared on site (forgot to mention there's a Cafe where it actually seems the workers actually WORK!)...and giving relationship advice.  Just a casual view of the seating area's state of cleanliness will tell you that if the rest are weary of the registers, they could definitely become more familiar with a broom and mop. Not to mention, there were plenty of stalls that were empty of items with the replenishing stock clearly in view in the back of the establishment.

Lastly, on the off chance someone who give a s**t actually reads this, consider this: 🤔 you chose a service industry job; your level of effort shouldn't be determined by your Ignorant and outdated opinions of who stands in front of you. I can expect this in a small town in a Southern state on the mainland.   But not in a place where the only difference between me and those I reference here is that their ancestors got ""dropped off"" the ship a few years before my own.

Do better...you know not who you may be treating like ""s**t"".  Life is not as as long as we think, and regardless of your religion or 'rearing' the one fact I know is that we are all part of one intelligent consciousness; and the way we treat others (or don't treat them) will be remembered and answerable one day.; la togo! donde hay ocho empleados y no componen ni uno en términos de servicio al cliente! they just don’t care about anything… where is management? it seems the lack of authoritative figures provoke this employee indifference to actually doing an efficient job at basic requirements & hospitality.; Good for to Go items like hot sandwiches and some pastry. Plus you can dime in, and has a good beer, wine and liquor variety. More for the locals, but great for low budget tourists..; Very convenient and has a nice selection of liquor. It’s also a meeting point for young folks that gather in front of the store to chill. Also, there’s a full bar with TVs that normally casts some important games and at times it gets really packed as any other bar. During daytime there’s also a cafeteria where you can get quick bites or order sandwiches, coffee, etc."

I also wanted them to know I 100% did not steal anything even though everything in my gut told me to just walk away..I have never been so embarrassed and appalled in my entire life. I will never, ever shop the store again. Nor will I ever recommend it to anyone else. I totally feel like I was racially profiled and treated poorly. I stole nothing , especially a single beer.

Both have short hair, (their choice). The cashier lady says out very loud a snarky comment about why my 3 yr old was going to the girls restroom with her sister. Insinuating that she was not a girl, but a boy. They say nothing and go on about their business. When my daughters come out the same lady makes a comment to the other worker that that boy really needs to cut his hair. I have no idea which child this cashier was speaking about, but the only other person in there was an elder lady. Those comments were made on pure assumptions that whichever kid of mine she was speaking of was indeed a male and needed to act more like it.
Absolutely disgraceful. Even if my 3 yr old was a male, she would have still went to the restroom with my older child as she is not quite ready  to be set free in a public bathroom alone.

Great selection on a variety of things, especially for a store of this size.; Do not and I mean do not go here about three days ago an older gentleman working the register stole money from me I gave him a $20 for $12 in snacks and drinks and he kept $4 saying the total was $16 after I seen the register say $12 and him originally asking for $12 nothing else was scanned after the total either unbelievable and then when I tried to correct him he cleared out the total and got very rude and vulgar as if he wanted to fight don’t go here when he’s working they need to fire him I’ve had wonderful service by both the ladies that work but I’ve had my money stolen and that’s why I gave such a poor review id love to hear from the owner cause that mans claiming he is but I know Sam"

The ladies making breakfast are awesome. Good food and they take care of the customers.  But now the owner has taken bread out of the breakfast menu. I don't like biscuits all the time. Mostly like a sandwich.  Now can't get that. That is ridiculous.  Mr. Jones is going to start losing business.  Especially from me. I have a storage unit at his store in Ducktown. I have to move cause the road construction is coming. Glad so I will not have to do business at his stores after I move. Just ridiculous you can't get a breakfast sandwich. You have sandwich option at all other breakfast spots. Why he has to stop. Makes no since.; Initially, I was impressed. I was headed to Racetrac, but I saw this new brightly lit Marathon with flashing lights around the car wash and I thought I’d stop in. It just so happened to be that it was $.06 cheaper per gallon than Racetrac, and Racetrac had the best price on Google maps.

But you pull up to the pump and the prices are all $.10 higher than the board. Now I know it’s not uncommon for them to have a cash price that’s lower, but they usually boldly advertise that if you pay cash, you can get a discount. This place was advertising their cash price on the board and in fine print underneath it it said cash. Print so fine that I couldn’t even see it on the reader board from the pumps, much less from the highway. Waste of my time. I got back in my car and drove across the highway to Racetrac because they ended up being $.04 cheaper gallon instead of $.06 more expensive per gallon. $.04 a gallon is nothing but they told the truth on their sign and that’s what I cared about.; Carwash leaves soap everywhere. Vacuum has no power. Attitude is always rude. Coffee is always grainy. Fuel is cheaper across the street(cash or credit). Place was better before it got bought out.; This is a pretty good gas station. The biscuits are pretty decent. They used to be better a couple years ago when they were made fresh after ordering but if I’m driving by I usually stop for breakfast."

This is a place where families stop to grab a quick bite before hitting the road again and it is a big unnecessary inconvenience to have a health related incident occur unexpectedly when it could've been avoided by simply providing fresh products for consumption.  If we pay for something with our hard earned money then we expect the best you could possibly provide especially with today's inflation issue.; Stopped to get gas, drinks, and use the restroom but the restrooms close 2 HOURS before closing? Why…? I could see the last 1/2 hour…. The cashier said they close them at 8 so they won’t have to go back and forth. It wasn’t even 8.. then she said when their shorthanded they close them early.; Stopped for drinks on the way to Taos.  Waited 3-4 minutes for the cashier to come out of her office and she walks to a different register.  Sees all of us standing at the other register doesn’t say a word.  When me n my boys walked to her, she was rude as hell.  I won’t ever stop there again whether gas is cheap or whatever.  Rather give my business to a place that actually has good customer service!!; Always good. El parasol inside is da bomb. New look is amazing. We moved n will miss you dearly. Already do!! Cheap gas. Here it's 2.50.  ouch! Take care n God bless!! You were always there for us!!; Incredible new updates all around at this store, with clean bathrooms and a very friendly staff.

I was visiting a nearby business that does not have a parking lot, so I parked at this GAS STATION and walked over to that business.

After my meeting I walked back to my car parked at this gas station and my phone started to ring. So I spent about 15 minutes on the phone around my car taking care of business.

As I finished a woman came out to me from the store and told me that this is private property and she has been watching me ""walking around"" and this is private property . During this time I was around my car walking up and down as I was on the phone. I also took a picture of the STREET to better remember it, and I was told I cannot do that either.

I must say I did not know that in America on a private property ( gas station), one will be asked to leave for taking care of a15 minute phone call. This is a very bad area of town and this gas station and the store is very run down and needs a renovation, so I do understand that it attracts people who truly are just loitering and being there without a purpose.

But it is very sad that normal people are asked to leave for nothing, for the fact that I took a phone call. I was planning to get my gas tank filled in my car here today after my meeting , for the fact that this gas station's gas prices are truly way cheaper than anywhere else in the area. In fact I used to come here a long time ago, when I used to live in the area. But after this experience I decided to get more expensive gas somewhere else, and it is worth for me to pay a few cents more just to be let alone in peace making my phone calls at a gas station.

I attached a picture of the gas station that I found on the internet, not that they tell me that I am not allowed to take pictures.; Cheap gas, friendly service & great old school style store. A lot of these cookie cutter gas stations can’t compare due to their extreme overhead. This is where I always stop to get my gas when I’m in the area as I am a contractor and drive around town ALL day.; Always Friendly Owner's Inside Whether 5he Husband Or Wife And BEST FUEL PRICES IN AVONDALE, AZ, That I'm Aware Of...; Cool little store on the corner of the street, pretty good selection for different types of items that you could be looking for at a convenience store.

Despite needing rest after a long day, I was awakened at 4:30 AM and denied further sleep. When I approached the security personnel or management, I was dismissively told to leave. I respectfully request that action be taken against the staff responsible. Furthermore, I would appreciate information on alternative accommodations for drivers, as Pilot stops are intended to provide facilities for rest, refueling, showering, and dining. The current situation is unacceptable - I urge you to address this issue. I await a response from the company. Please provide information on where and on which website I can file a complaint to ensure measures are taken. Your parking lot staff are engaging in arbitrary behavior.; Well I tried telling maintenence about the issue in shower 12 which you can't cut off the water and they did not want to do anything about it. It is literally stuck all the way on hot. Yes I know about there not being any cold water to go with the hot but I don't think it is supposed to get stuck all the way on hot and not be able to cut it off. So here is some pics to prove what I'm saying.; Worst pilot ever. They done answer their phones, put calling restrictions in their work phone!!! Plus, when I was booking my shower, app said there’s no wait for showers. As soon as I booked it, 3 people ahead of me. Well 3 to 2 and 2 to 1. Next surprise, again after 1 person, there’s 2 people ahead of me again. 🤦🏻 finally 2 hours later, I got my shower. It was alright not very friendly place. Except that one guy who let me park just to take a shower, where I wasn’t supposed to be parked. 3 stars are cuz of him.; I went to the Wendy's on site and it was clean and well lit. The staff was so friendly and helpful, and the food was fresh and tasty. I'll definitely make this a regular road stop just to visit this Wendy's on my road trips.; I'm all over the country...
This is probably 30yrs newer than the old Flying J franchise stores (like Broadway Flying Js) but , as those are infamous for being neglected and run down , and mismanaged,  this one is quite possibly worse.
Just my take on it.
Showers suspect at best...
Parking lot is a joke... drop trailers and homeless camping. No way in he'll all them trucks paying for their parking.  Every spot full, and app still says 58 spots open.
Some trucks look like they been sitting there since '94 ... trash everywhere.
Management and security lacking.
No role call for the paid parking...so u can just park. If there's ever a spot. I haven't found a spot there since 2019...
Stop being so anti-confrontational and chase the trashy rivers out.
Drop trailers,  broken down and abandoned trucks... parking lot pissers...
Get rid of em.

Yet ... I'm headed that way. Cuz that's where we fuel. ✌🏼"

According to the store clerk the pumps run slow when it is cold (like a safety mode), I had a reward for 40 cents off/gallon, so I got in my vehicle and waited probably a solid 15 minutes for it to fill up. Then I heard it, the pump didn't shut off when my vehicle was full. Spilled at least a gallon of fuel on the ground before I realized it. The fuel is great here (top tier), but the condition of the pumps is ridiculous. I'll go to Circle K or QT over this place any time now.; Stopped at this gas station and paid cash for my gas unfortunately I forgot to pump it, went back and the clerk at the register was trying to help but he didn't know what to do but he remembered me paying gas and I also had my recept piece of cake right? WRONG, after he talked to the manager in duty,  she came storming out of the back telling me there's no way they refunding me my money because there's no way for her to find out if I pumped my gas or not!!! BS,  she was rude, so at the end of the day when they reconcile the pumps and register WHO KEEPS MY $10??? Called the customer service line, they had me on hold for 5 minutes and then hung up on me.; Stopped to top of my fuel and check air pressure of my bike tires before proceeding to Oracle and up the Contact Rd to Mt. Lemmon. No line to wait for and plenty of room in the parking lot for other Adventure Riders to meet prior to the trek ahead up to Mt. Lemmon. Must add I was very happy that their pay for air machine was operational to fill up my next to flat rear tire.👍👍💯; We live near here and stop for gas at least one a week. They run out of gas quite often or they're running out of gas which makes the pumps run REALLY slowly (like 3 gallons in 5 minutes). Seems like maybe they need to do a better job of ordering gasoline so they don't run out! It's frustrating if I forget to stop in town and then this is the last station before home and they're out of gas!; Regular here and stop by probably 3-4 times a week. Always greeted with a smile and good customer service. Very polite and friendly. Pumps could use some updating but nothing out of the ordinary. Keep up the good work!"

The cashier was not helpful and when my coupon didn't work I was given a smart a** remark followed by her name and managers name . Instead of just helping. It seems that customers are not first. I wish there was another store that I could go.  I also think that's the main reason why they treat you like they do.; Circle k is always busy. They don't usually have many hot foods out if any! The clerks are good workers. And helpful! The restrooms are handicap accessable. And kept clean. They rum out of donuts fast. They have good coffee.; Odd gas situation at this Circle K: the gas station with many, many gas pumps but no gas at any of them higher than 87 octane. This town has an acclaimed state park which is also an international dark sky destination, so gets visitors from around the state and the country. Why would you not have at least one pump with an octane-level in the gas that is needed by 20% of the cars Americans drive?; The 1star review has nothing to do with the staff. The staff are always freindly (especially Dan) and are trying their best.

But pay at the pump hasn't work.for over 2 months. They only have 87 octane and diesel and will often run out of gas. The coffee is often out of certain beans, the donuts are often missing bags or deli paper, the hot dog rollers are often empty.

If Oracle had another option, this store would close within a month.; Quick in & out the times I stopped here to top off. Corporate prices and operating hours are convenient. Seems clean enough but have never really wandered in the store. Staff was friendly."

Come back a few days later, the ads are still up in the store 🙄 someone told me it was in the app too.; No longer clean and not much operational. It's clear they've given up.

When I was there I was kind and very respectful to my customers because I wanted them to have a great experience at the store I was working at the time, I’m now in California, and I’m sorry to all my regular customers! I will miss you all!!; I'd give zero stars if I could. I tried to fill up on gas and the attendant tried to tell me I had to face a certain direction. All the cars were facing different directions and there were no painted arrows or signs displayed anywhere indicating a mandatory direction. He was walking around trying to force cars to follow what he wanted and ended up creating more chaos. After waiting several minutes to get gas a pump finally opened up and I when I turned around to line up my tank with the pump he told me I couldn't do that because the cars needed to be facing the same direction. But ALL THE CARS WERE FACING DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. WHY WAS I SINGLED OUT? If you want cara facing a certain direction, paint arrows or place signs. He let other cars face different directions but I couldn't get gas because he didn't like the direction my car was facing. Unless you have directions clearly displayed, it's not your place to tell me how to pull up to a pump to get gas.; As far as circle k goes, this is a good one. Probably helps that it's not on the south side. Anyway, there's a QT further north on oracle so that had likely made this location up their game. Beautiful Pusch Ridge in the background.; Typically at this Circle K service is great it's great!! Extremely rube service this morning. Cashier was upset with me because I did not want to use self checkout. So she made smart comments underneath her breath. I did not want to use self check out because it was coming up with the wrong price. Bag of peanut butter pretzels says right on the back 2 for $3. It was coming up 2 for $3.50 on self checkout. Cashier rings it up and it still comes up $3.50 even though the bag says 2 for $3 she still wanted me to pay $3.50.  Then becomes extremely rude when she has to change the price.

I asked for her name, ""I'm not providing u that"". I mind u she had major attitude with her replies. Makes me not want to ever go to circle k; Was at circle k in Catalina on Aug 6 around 10pm to purchase gas and redeem scratcher tickets, when cashier rudely said it's past 10pm and you can not have scratchers checked,then went on helping the person in front of us. I said since when did time changed and she just ignored me. So didn't get gas, left and went to Valero got gas AND turned scratchers in.. If your going to work with the public probably a good idea to have a employee that has the right attitude to work with the public. She may need to be retrained in customer service.
Lori Ortiz-Maxwell; This place used to be the best Circle K. In Tucson, but OMG has it changed over the last couple of weeks, I feel like I am standing in line at the. MVD, and need to pull a number. Not sure what's going on. The shelves are empty, and it's more like a seven eleven than what circle k is known for it's almost as bad as the one in Marana.; Terrible customer service. No help with self checkout, but refuses to open cash register to ring up a customer. This place sucks now.; Never been inside as I'm only here to purchase fuel.

I went into fill up, and also noticed my tire light was illuminated. I pulled over thereafter to the servicing department and this charming young man (Devin) offered his invaluable assistance.

He checked my tire, confirmed that it was low, put some air in it and offered some sound and practical advice on how to proceed with purchasing another tire which I did elsewhere immediately.

Although I have roadside assistance wisdom averted having to utilize and pure happenstance that the light came on at that exact moment and I got the service I needed and then some which was extraordinary!

Shell, please know what a wonderful employee you have in this young man who was warm, endearing, empathetic, professional and knowledgeable as his invaluable service/assistance alone gave me the security I needed to make it home on a wing and coupled with a little prayer of which I am deeply grateful for.

Double the five stars as this was absolutely a ten-star and most deserving experience! Thank you Devin and wishing you all the best!; The tires on my Tesla were low and there was no air machine in the area.  I pulled up to the service station and they filled up my tires for free.  The manager was very friendly and helpful.  They refused payment for the service and I was impressed enough by their courteousness to leave this review.; The store is very.diverse. great for snacks,  lunch, drinks and convenience items. The car wash does a great job. The access is a little challenging so proceed with caution.; Not going back there with the creepy guy behind the counter."

They double charged me. Wouldn’t issue a refund. Proceeded to become ruder and insulting. Referred me to a manager but then gave me the phone number of the phone directly behind them. When I called the number, they laughed and hung up. The car wash that I was double charged for did not wash the car at all. I paid $14 to be insulted, laughed at, and have my car just as dirty as when I arrived. Completely ridiculous. I wish I would’ve read all of the other one star reviews before this experience.; I think the manager Alex and one of the customer service reps Dee are amazing. They are always friendly and looking for ways to make sure you have a good experience. They are honestly some of the best customer service folks I know. I fill up here regularly both gas and propane.; Not that impressed with Super Pumper that closes at 8pm on Saturday evenings. I was shoo’d away by the cashier and told not to come back until 6am. When asked if this was a one time occurrence or new hours she said, “it is today, today is the day the hours are like this” …. Cool, I’ll go next door to Circle K; No bathroom, bad prices, really annoying ads on the pumps.  Make you answer a bunch of dumb questions before you even can pump gas; I went in and this rude lady worked there started yelling at me about going down an isle she just mopped (and how I wasn’t allowed to go down it)."

Especially inconvenient for those of us that need diesel. People just parked more then half of the pumps chilling eating their food not even trying to move now I’m late for work because EVERYONE parks at the pump. So annoying.; I asked the front desk if the air pump was working and the man says “yes, should be”. I go dump $2 in it and it doesn’t work. I then go back inside and inquire and the man says “it’s not ours we don’t know anything about it.” That is fine but why not say that in the first place?

What is it with gas station air pumps never working. My own failure though, and have now gone to Amazon and bought an air compressor for $25. Suggest everyone do so. Surely I can’t be the only one having been to 4 stations to find one functioning air compressor, which is an annoying 1st world problem.; Cashier was rude. Multiple pumps wouldn't work for chip cards, in any fashion, and I could barely get a word in while she explained to me that I was the problem and that I shouldn't do what I wasn't even doing. Unfortunate that it's the only place around.; Park on the gas station for a minute wild I was wrapping up a call and gas station owner started yelling at me to move the ****** away!! That’s not a parking! I was terrified and had to move and refuel somewhere else. I will never go back there!"

Went in to get gas didn't realize it was full service only but they had a restroom I desperately needed so told the attendant go ahead toss 15g in. At almost $6 a gallon!! What did my full-service entail you ask? NOTHING No air pressure check, no window wash, no fluid checks NOTHING was done to my vehicle except putting the over valued gas I paid for in it. I asked another attendant if I had to fill up to get ""full service"" his answer was a huffy no..  add insult too injury I had already tipped the attendant after using the restroom inside while paying, no cash back option to tip anyone.. odd but I had cash anyway so I tipped the attendant well.

""most people don't bother to tip us""

And you wonder why?.

Way to take advantage of the working man and steal his tip money for nothing!

Fwiw I had went up and came down from Christoper creek and my windshield was covered in bugs.; Needed gas yesterday and stopped expecting the usual.  Anything but !!  It was like I had entered a time warp.  The guys there made my day.  Friendly complete service and nice conversation.  Wife and I have been telling people about the experience.

I will NEVER spend one cent at this establishment ever again, there is no compassion or kindness anymore.  SO SAD!!!

I am surprised that they were even able to get it to work here.; Somewhat uncomfortable to park and not the easiest to find but in a secure location, under roof, and within what is basically an upscale shopping area where one can go and shop, eat, etc...  In the US most of the superchargers are in malls or gas stations under the blazing sun and a good walk from amenities, when you have them.  Some places don't have anything other than a quick shop in a bad neighborhood.  It can be improved but is definitely better than many I used in the US.; Extremely difficult to access (you have to enter a parking garage through a “no entrance” gate) and there are only 2 stalls, only one of which was working. Unfortunately this is it for superchargers in San Juan so as Tesla owners we have no choice and are basically SOL.; Tesla needs to get their shi! together. This pathetic excuse for a charger sometimes slows down to only 24kw, and shows a 2 1/2 hour charge time for my model Y. There are only two stalls and they’re incredibly hard to access. To only have two chargers in a city of over 1 million people is just ridiculous. Get it together Tesla"

WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE! The shuttle was great until we got to the location. Short staffed in ALL the areas. Only 2 people attending the front counter. The line was long, took almost 2 hours to get to counter. Once we got to pickup area it was chaos. Another 45 minutes wait. Lots of commotion and people rejecting cars. Contract shows car with full tank IT WAS ON EMPTY. The usb charger completely gone. I tried calling once I realized NO ANSWER. When I returned the car I was charged more than agreed. NEVER AGAIN.; I DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL. The rental car  was scratched up which I didn’t like but that was not the  biggest problem. The car had roaches. Yes ROACHES. Our trip was 4 days but we only drove the rental for 2 days until the roaches started coming out. We ended up having to take Ubers everywhere for the next few days including to  the airport because we didn’t want to bring roaches home with us. We bombed the car with 3 roach bombs and there were still roaches alive crawling around. When I called the customer service line I was continuously hung up on for a full day and when I finally spoke to Iris a customer service rep she told me she would still drive the rental with the roaches. Before leaving I went back to allied and spoke to the supervisor who pretend to care but I was still charged more then she said I would be. I would never use this company again.; Pros: Car was decent, not raeally dirty as I expected judging by the reviews. However please make sure you take pics of the car before leaving as majority of the cars are damaged. Also very cheap, if booked at the right time and with a third party. Def book in advance. I used Priceline.

Cons: longest wait for a rental car ever!!!!!!! The worst, only one to two people at the counter even when there is a massive line. They don’t even bother to tell customers if they have cars or not. I was the last to get a car while others were still waiting. Instead, they allow them to waste more of their time. I arrive at 2, left just before 5 AM.; The shuttle took a long time but the car is in decent condition and rides smooth. The location is with a few other car rental places. Service was fairly fast and everyone is saying “hidden fees” but it’s just the normal hold they charge in your card which is then returned to you, ours was $250 and we ended up paying $350 total including for the tolls, which is fair. Since $250 will be returned that means I only payed $100 for tolls and expenses on top of the car.; Be careful when renting a car with this place using a third party company nor with them directly.  They will advertise showing a really low price and then when you arrive at the counter they will bring every excuse possible and charge triple, even when the price at the bottom states including taxes, fees and extras.  In addition please check the car triple times or even drive for 2 min to make sure is not full or roaches
After telling me they were going to work with me in giving me the rental for a price ending up being a lie, they came and gave me a car that was full of roaches and it even had the roach bombs inside the car it was nasty as hell

Please check the car and also the fees prior completing the rental

Called CS to speak with a Sup and Rep Jarol stated there was no Sup at all that ge can either file a complaint for me (which I know it will never be done) or the only way to contact a sup was by email, which this is a sign that Reps can get away with anything they including treating customers bad and even laughing at them just like this rep did to me.

I'm pretty sure it was once 24 hours until robbed at gunpoint but cant confirm.

I generally go in the day anyway. Come traditional lunch break times the place gets very busy, and I mean very, very busy which can be bothersome.

The staff on hand plays a big role. I know when angel was basically saving the store at one point, kept a few regulars but had a  decent employee turnover rate nonetheless.

The ones that have been there seem to have 2 personalities - the fake nice (which we've all been forced to I'm sure) ,and  2. Surprisingly, they are rxtremely welcoming and playful with regulars they like.

I can say they've never been personally rude to me or anything like that though.

The locked coolers also slow down your trip some, especially busy hours.; Simply put avoid this location at all cost. Dean the manager is just as tacky and unprofessional as the employee. Which explains why they work where they do! If you’re looking for low-class or non-existent customer service, then 40th St and University is where you’ll find the hood.; Warning ⚠️ when you pay $15 in cash at 10:20 am in the Chevron store and head out fill up the gas you just purchased, you may be getting ripped off.
Here’s why... after putting in gas and getting ready to leave the gas station suddenly out of the clear blue your partner asks, “ you only put $14.12 in the gas tank????” He says, “No, I put in $15 and turns his head to the pump”.  He than gets out of SUV and goes back into the gas station store. The same female with Hispanic dark hair with really long acrylic nails and tattoos on her forearm is working and informs her that it didn’t fill up to $15 in gas.  She acts dumb and says I don’t know what you’re talking about? My partner informs her the details again and she denies it. Than he has to come right out and call her out on it. He says, “give me back the rest of the money that didn’t fill up in my tank. I want my change now.” She finally gives it up and was distasteful in doing so. Theft is theft even if in small change. I wonder how many people she’s done this too? The warning ⚠️ , she’s pocketing the change or using the gas for someone else - who knows? So PAY ATTENTION! Chevron has a thief working for them. Happy Memorial Day ☹️; I personally just started working here @CHEVRON and I love it! STAFF & CUSTOMERS!! SOOOO WELCOMING I COULDN'T ASK FOR ANYTHING MORE!!

The service is good most times but can be lackluster at other times. You say hi or have a nice day and you sometimes do not get a response back. Something that frustrates me about this place is the fact they do not display the total cost of the items purchased anywhere.

I absolutely support them 110%. I love everything they carry and the great food they offer. The owners and workers are fantastic. The prices may be a tad higher, but the value is worth every penny! Thanks!😃👏☀️; This store is expensive.... everything about it. A prime example: when gas is $3.09 everywhere else it's $3.32 here. Almost everything inside the store is marked up way more than other gas station / convenient stores. The guys that own it have been there forever and are very friendly and accommodating. They don't seem to have hardly any turnover with employees so they must be treating them well. They do have a ton of items neatly crammed inside. You can find anything from fine cigars to some pretty high dollar alcohol in this store. So in summary I'll go here if I have to. I'll get gas here if I'm on E or running on fumes. The people that own it are pleasant.; Absolute horrendous customer service! I was having issues with a faulty pump and notified the attendants immediately. The pump continued to charge my card as the incident went down, despite gas not actually going into my tank. I asked if there was a way to initiate a refund and I was told that I would have to call Shell’s customer service. That’s fine, I understood  that companies have different departments that handle different things. HOWEVER, things got nasty when I asked for the number of their customer service line and they refused to give it to me. Instead, they insisted that the faulty pump was my issue and that I would actually have to pay for $90 worth of gas that did not go into my tank. On top of this, they threatened me with a $5 charge because they had to use their equipment to fix the issue. How on earth is it the customer’s fault when a pump is not working properly?? And why do I have to pay for a multi billion dollar company’s equipment when something breaks down? Accidents like this happen, and I believe a company should be prepared for it and not blame a customer when something doesn’t work properly. Instead, I was berated and treated as though everything was my fault when I did the right thing by notifying the workers of a potential safety issue. Honestly, with their nasty, evil attitudes this place should be shut down."

The station itself is pretty cool, offering many useful items for truck drivers. I particularly liked the portable DVD player.

Overall, I’d give it an 8/10; I found the axle of the trailer leaking oil this morning. I just replaced the bearing, oil seal, and brake shoe here. The mechanic JJ Philips was very professional and responsible, which made me feel at ease and completed the work quickly, saving me time to continue my trip. All the employees in the shop are also very warm and friendly. Thank you for their professional and enthusiastic service!; I liked it . We have been traveling and we got there , they have hot showers.
The water was hot . They had fresh clean towels . The store was well maintained.  They have plenty of snacks , souvenirs and items for your truck.  The restroom was clean and well maintained also. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would recommend this place.  They also have diesel and unleaded.; The woman who works at night is extremely dirty. Her behaviour is absolutely disgusting and rude She does not have the manners to talk to the customers and says that we do not sale the goods at night.
And she said I don’t care
Priscia something like that her name
Very very rude; Love TA! Good clean travel center but this location is short on staff and still manages to get the job done. The Popeye’s isn’t open all night, just a fyi. This TA could use more good workers too, especially overnight. Needs maintenance because various machines are out of service all around the facility!

Area around the pumps and store is in good shape, with plenty of parking for trucks and campers. (although the dirt lot is pretty rough in spots… just watch out for the pot holes. 🤣)
Also enjoyed chatting with the gals that were making and selling jewelry at the little outdoor Navo market. Bought a bracelet for my daughter.
I try to stop here whenever I’m passing this way.; The building was unique with a high ceiling and lots of collectibles at ok prices. There was lots of shade outside and since it was on native land it still required a mask which they provided."

Would definitely come here again!; This place is really awesome the art the craft they have is beautiful, you can even get two blankets for 10 dls a piece that's hand crafted by the natives, and they have some of the most beautiful stones.

The staff is very very friendly there is lots of parking and the restrooms are very clean.; 9/22/2018 was my first road trip and Traveling from California to New Mexico was longer then I expected, being iv never been out of California I wanted to stop almost everywhere and my husband happily did so And when we stopped in Gallup, New Mexico we pulled in to NAVAJO TRAVEL PLAZA when we entered there doors I knew this wasn't your ordinary everyday store! Well not one iv ever seen before anyways, first thing we encountered was beautiful warm welcomings, I then realized that I'm not only in a store but in place of beauty and religion, they have beautiful authentic hand painted sand paintings that are displayed with love And respect, the prices vary but with the customer in mind leaving you the customer very satisfied, they have a variety of amazing authentic handcrafted pottery displayed in various places inside the store prices vary aswell, they have multiple different types of Amazing Navajo art throughout the amazing store aswell as T-shirt and many different types of awesome survivers from postcards to route 66 little signs and so much more, they have the best vanilla soft serve ice cream iv ever tasted in my life, they have a variety of beverages,candy,chip,ect.
They have massive fireworks im guessing almost every kind of legal firework and everything is inexpensive again keeping there customers in mind and that kind of company/business is the best kind!!
The best part of my visit to NAVAJO TRAVEL PLAZA is the knowledge I learned from the lady whom I wish I would have asked for her name took the time to teach me about her heritage and religion of the art from her love ones and ancestors leaving me to want to learn more and that was the best part of my whole trip, I'm writing my review as we are on our way home back to California,
One things for Shure if your passing thru GALLUP, NEW MEXICO I recommend you stop by NAVAJO TRAVEL PLAZA youll be happy you did I promise!; Cool place
Very clean
Non pushy when
comes to a sale
Too many deals to list
Must see to appreciate; Nice clean gas station. Restrooms were nice. Lots of souvenirs. They're currently cleaning the pavement on a hot summer day which I believe says a lot of a gas station."

Even the parking lot is pothole less! The restrooms and showers are clean, as the laundry room too is immaculate. No wait times!
The shop is clean and efficient on getting you out pn yue road fast.
There are multiple pumps for fuel, which are clean, presure washed and safe to walk on.
Inside, a well stocked store with friendly staff. They even have beer!
There is a Popeyes chicken, sadly some of the staff there actually think mask work.🤣
Nevertheless, there is a Black Bear Dinner, which has better food than most of the chain. Nice portions, hot, fresh food with remarkable service.
The other TA's nationally could learn from this place.; Always big line on desk only one employee on duty. She is also tired not understanding i think she needs rest or sleep; Great little stop before the Pheonix/Flagstaff exit. It is 0.2miles from the exit so be sure to merge left as soon as you leave! Gas was cheapest in the area $3.52. Diesel is available.
Bathrooms were nice. There's a cool popcorn machine and we got a few bags for us and the kids.
Kids love the tiny green dino out front.
Black Bear Diner is conveniently next door and we totally would have ate if we had the time.; This TA location is awesome with both black bear diner and Popeyes. Great coffee and everything is stocked up well. a sigh of relief after a long travel from Vegas. The only problem is there is a small entry to this to this gas station which you could easily miss since there is another gas station next to it.; Mad rush for parking when the sun goes down. Getting in and out of the driveway is challenging because of the traffic and a nearby traffic light. They recently re-did the whole parkng setup.  You may be fooled by the old lines that were kinda painted over. Just follow the bright yellow lines and you'll be fine.
There's a Black Bear diner here. Havent eating at this one but so far the ones that I have eaten at are pretty good. There's also a Wendy's next door."

They take safeway points so you can use your points to lower the fuel points.

Staff is always nice and polite and easy to speak to.

Always stop here for relief and gas.; The parking space is good to rest in, and the toilet is nice, but... There's no toilet paper... How am I supposed to get out of here?; So thankful to the attendant who helped two European Girls with their rental car, which had an insufficient oil level. dear kind attendant, if you read this: we made our way to Grand Canyon and further on!! thank you!; Good stop along hwy. 93 for fuel, hot and cold drinks, food, snacks and personal items for your travels. Fuel prices are a little high but convenient  stop coming off of hwy. 40 heading to Vegas. Clean restrooms; Sign says $5.29, pump says $5.39. There's nothing saying extra for using a credit card. Then, to top it off, none of the washer stations had towels, and I had to search for one with wash water in it!

Also the stores tend to be organized. As you walk in, there are options for car supplies like car chargers and etc. Also a food and coffee bar as well. Subway is there for those of whom who are craving sandwiches. Come check them out.; It’s July 28th and I was parked here overnight and something really out of the normal happen today. I was blocked of two trucks parked near me and a woman truck driver that had also got blocked because of my truck started some streaming on social media showing everyone’s trucks while those drivers were asleep. Anyway when I went to the store to take a shower till everyone wakes up so could move that lady trucker run into the store shouting “block the shower don’t let him in he’s blocking my truck etc.” what happened afterwards was very disrespectful and disappointing. The most unprofessional and offensive behaviour from loves team member I think she was the duty manager today and her names Corine. While I was leaving my bag in the shower she run inside pushing me around and yelling ate saying I won’t be having any showers wt they’re store for some reason she decided to use physical contact against a customer and a professional driver at her duty. When I realised that she’s going too far with her attitude I turned on my video and started recording all of it. For further investigation and as a proof of the unacceptable actions against customers. I also took pictures of those involved in this incident so that everyone else could be aware of who they have to deal with when they’re stopped at this truck stop. Officer from sheriffs office arrived at the scene and I filed a complaint against this person/lady for physical assault and refuse of the services based on the ethnic background. I have been to almost all the love’s country stores and never experienced anything like this before I have a strong wish to report this incident to they’re head management and explain that this goes completely against they’re policy and of course against business practices. ‘Clean places, but are the faces really friendly ?’ Violent and rude would I state.; I encountered Patrick at the fuel pumps as he was straightening up and replenishing supplies. He was very pleasant and was doing a great job. He provided me with some very useful info about the local area and later was the person who refilled my motorhome propane tank. It was easy to see he knew what he was doing.  People like Patrick make my travels more pleasant.  My thanks to him and the rest of the staff.; The desert of Arizona is pretty desolate around here, so I figured to stop at this Love's, use the restroom, grab a snack and continue onwards. I was not needing gas today, so parking in the RV spots was easy.

Inside, the men's room was clean, the coolers were fully stocked and the coffee station was clean. This was a positive experience today for me.; Unless you are shutting down for your 10 hr break or a 34 restart be prepared to lose half of your clock here ....it took over 3  hours to get in the shop for 1 tire. The truck we were waiting on to get out so we could get in was in the shop for over 6.5 hours for 2 tires. When I walked over to see how much longer it was going to be all 3 techs were standing in the area where the tires are stored talking and looking at their phones.  When I asked why it was taking so long the guys response was IT COULD TAKE LONGER....so that told me right there that they do not care about their customers, they have zero respect for truckers time and they are just riding the clock for a paycheck and passing the buck to the next shift.  We will never stop at this Loves again. Zero stars if possible. Ya suck - Do better."

Figured I would fill up with diesel and propane and then wash the RV. The girl behind the counter said my work gas card wasn’t accepted so I used my personal card. This was because the employee was ignorant to the process of a company card and just kept saying she didn’t know. I then paid 100 bucks and went out to fuel. The pump was running slow and stopped at 77 and some change so I went back to inform them and this is when they figured out they were out of fuel. So I put the bottom of the barrel fuel in my RV and we all know the problem with that is dirty fuel that will clog filters. Plus, I’m pretty sure I didn’t even get 77 worth of fuel because I started on a half a tank and the needle barley moved. The girl behind the counter stated there was no excuse for my attitude. I stated to her that there is no excuse for running out of fuel which caused this. There is no excuse for a wash being closed when it says it’s open. I asked about the truck wash and apparently I was lied to earlier because the wash was still not open either! She said the remainder of the fuel credit would automatically go back on my card which I haven’t seen yet! I WILL NEVER GO TO THESE PLACES AGAIN! Loves will have my business from this point on! To the girl behind the counter…grow a brain DA! Talk about a mismanaged place? OMG! MISERABLE EXPERIENCE! Under trained employees will sink a company and this one is well on its way!

Been his customer for 4+ yrs since we moved  here in brownwood.  Always professional attitude with smile,  and his employees as well.

Mr Hunter business operates,  vehicle inspection and gas station.

If you have disability,  not easy to walkout from your vehicle but, need to put some gas in your vehicle,  Mr. Hunter and his employee come out and put the gas for you.

He is truly a honest business man in town, me and my husband highly recommend him to anyone.👍👍👍👍; Revising my review to say I was ripped off here at one point. We were asked to pay $79 THROUGHA HUNTERS I HANDED THEM CASH!!!! Then argued with me that it was not this store when in fact it was. We expect to pay the $79 again and was told it was only $7. Same as the other places this time. I will never come back here nor will I suggest anyone come here. If you've had a good experience that's awesome. But we will not come back here after finding out that we got stolen from."

It was irritating to me b/c I want to use the bathroom (this was at 4:15pm) and I wouldn't have stopped at a gas station that didn't have a bathroom. I was grumbling to myself as I turned away but decided to walk in and ask if their bathroom was broken or why there was no bathroom. She spoke rudely to me and told me they have that sign there for people who come at night b/c the bathroom isn't opened 24/7. I told her it'd be better if there was no sign. She spoke in a rude manner. Not sure who owns this place, but you should hire people with better customer service skills.  Also, you don't need a sign saying that...it's confusing.

I recently visited Love’s Travel Stop and had a fantastic experience. The facility was exceptionally clean and well-maintained, offering a wide range of amenities for travelers. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, making my stop very pleasant. The convenience store was well-stocked with a great selection of snacks, drinks, and travel essentials. The restrooms were spotless, which I greatly appreciated. I highly recommend Love’s Travel Stop for anyone looking for a convenient and comfortable break during their travels!; Excellent customer service,  Stephanie was at the front register and welcomed me in and thanked me when leaving.

Cashiers were very sweet and thanked us for coming in. Tons of selection for gift, snacks, and drinks. Plenty of pumps and parking spaces.

One random but pleasant detail I noticed was that the hand soap had a nice cherry scent with pumice for cleaning greasy hands (similar to Fast Orange). The texture surprised me at first but it worked really well!; I’m a truck driver coming off the road around 11:30 pm and I wanted to eat healthy so I went up to the Subway to get me a tuna sub and the slim mid size white guy waive me off and told me that they were closed ( and he did it in a nasty way ) although all the food and servings were still out so I went to the store cashier and ask what time does the subway close and they said that its open 24 hours. So the guy was nasty and refuse to serve me. He was nasty very unprofessional and rude.; This review reflects the Commercial Truck General Maintenance Shop, #610( Tires, oil changes, wipers, ect) Not major repairs.

In July I accompanied my son Joseph on a 1,500 mile trip to Texas to pick up a semi tractor that my son had purchased. The semi was to be driven to Cape Coral Florida where Joseph and family are presently living.

Since we were about 50 miles away from the nearest highway, the test drive was performed on the local roads with very restricted speed limits. When we finally reached the highway and were able to increase the driving speed the truck had a severe vibration which was a safety issue.

A Google search led us to Loves Truck Stop in Baird, Texas. Upon arriving, they were greeted and assisted by Haynes, the shop foreman.
We were directed to pull into the garage and his mechanics Joe, Corey and Steven removed both front tires and placed them on the balancing machine. After several attempts to balance both tires, they regrouped. Knowing the history of the truck being stored for two years in extreme heat, it was decided to install two new tires. The old tires had developed a flat spot from sitting for so long. The shop foreman and mechanics went to work and never complained. Everyone was ecstatic when the problem was resolved. Joseph and I were very impressed with Haynes, Joe, Corey and Steven's work ethics, professionalism and help with a smile. They took our predicament as a challenge. I highly recommends their service center. Staff is an asset to Loves.

Loves travel Maintenance Shop #610 is highly recommended!!!! Thank you!!!"

The garage team is, quite frankly, fantastic.  Here are my main points:

1.  Their prices are fair, and they stand behind their work.  They installed an axle on my Outback which broke a few days later (manufacturer's flaw).  Before I could say anything, they assured me they would reinstall the replacement part for free.  Of course, they are required to do this, but most shops wait for you to bring it up.

2.  They are thorough. I had an odd clanking in my Outback for years.  I took the car to several shops.  No one could figure it out.  On an oil change, I asked one of their mechanics (Dave) about it and he said he'd take a look.  A few hours later he called me about a bent strut that was hidden behind the shrouds (that all had to be removed) which was soon to fail.  He brought in welding equipment and fixed it.  The repair was very inexpensive (he did not charge for the nearly 2 hours to finally identify it).

3.  They respect your car.  No smears.  The radio and AC are not at 100%.  No dirt everywhere.  And they strive to make sure your car is secure overnight.

4.  They are a 10min walk from the metro, which makes dropping it off easy (if you can use the metro).

5.  They are honest.  All of their work stands to scrutiny.  When I needed major suspension work done as diagnosed by the dealer and another two independent shops, they cited the exact same issues at about 75% the dealer price and equal to other local shops.  They do not push needless work  at every oil change, unlike a lot of shops.

6.  They understand urgency.  If you tell them you are in a bind, they will prioritize your car if they can.

To be fair, they can be a bit slow updating you on your car's status, but they are usually busy.  They've never been disrespectful when I call asking for updates.  Finally, I've worked mainly with their mechanic, Dave.  He is absolutely fantastic, and I strongly recommend him, although the whole team is strong.; Prompt service. I have had several vehicles evaluated and repaired here. Very competent mechanics and absolutely honest. If something doesn't need fixing they call you and tell you. They always call before any major issues to discuss with you. I trust them over multiple other places.; I have been going since I learned to drive and the guys at wheelers have always done a great job at a reasonable price; Patched a tire late night when no one else was open. Great service."

They usually have what I’m shopping for and I think the staff is nice enough. I’m not trying to find a best friend, I just wanna get my food and go.; The employees here are rude and need to be re-trained on customer service. I had come in looking to buy produce. One of the female employees was stocking the area but talking to another co-worker in front of the produce I was looking to buy. I politely asked if I could grab one, she then proceeded to shove one of the items at me and then said now stop interrupting me.; The checkout situation at this location is criminal. After converting nearly half of the registers to self checkout, which most of the time don’t work, coming here has been such a nuisance. My most recent visit I waited 30 minutes in a line all the way to the back wall just to get to a self checkout station. There are often no registers open with a sales clerk. Bring back your register staff or fix your self checkout stations. Until then, you’re losing your loyal customers to other grocery stores who don’t have this problem.; I’m not quite sure if this Kroger will ever Improve. I’ve considered posting a review for almost a year now. Ever since they replaced half the registers with awful belt checkouts..
it doesn’t matter what time of day you go.. you will most likely be disappointed with their lack of produce. And heavens forbid you come before 12pm or after 7pm.. you will be waiting in line all the way to the coolers in the back. On the days they actually seem to have stock, the employees utilize every cart possible for their empty boxes.
It’s frustrating how frustrated I leave this store every single time. I question why I continue coming back. Convenience I guess.. but clearly I need to move on. Get it together Kroger.; I had an extremely disappointing experience at this Kroger, primarily due to the unprofessional behavior of a customer service associate named Bonita. From the moment I approached her for assistance, she was immediately combative and dismissive. Her attitude made me feel incredibly disrespected. I hope Kroger takes this feedback seriously and addresses the issue to improve their customer service."

I had a Link card to pay for the food and a debit card for non food items. The cashier lied to me about using the Link card and deducted  everything  from my debit card which would cause an overdraft on my bank account. I went to customer service and had them cancel the first transaction and check everything out again using the Link card. And my debit card- for a lower amount. I was told it may take 2-3 days before the cancelled transaction and credit will be on  my account. I will be calling the bank Monday.. No apologies from the cashier. He walked away. I had a large order and was very angry when I left the store. Always carefully check your receipts.

.; If there is a way I could write a review and not mark any stars. I WOULD!  Went to get gas. Listed price was $3.59 a gallon. I had 30 cents off per gallon. Went back to the pump still had $3.59 and did not drop to $3.29. Went back to cashier and told him what was going on. And he said he was in the process of raising prices up yet nothing had been changed on the signs or the pumps.  COMPLETELY GOT RIPPED OFF OF A CHEAPER PRICE PER GALLON. WILL NOT GO BACK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!; This store is awful.   Yesterday was the last straw.  The produce section is horrible.  There's literally rotting foods on the shelves.
We wanted lettuce for salads and almost all were past the use by date.  It was the evening of December 26, and many expired salad packs from Dec 21-24.  And some expiring dec 26.  Stuff with expiration dates will in the past wasn't even marked down unless it looked like it was actively rotting.  Some salad packs had lettuce liquefying and rotting.  We wanted to get sweet onions and the only sweet onions were squishy and rotten.  Onions keep for many weeks, so these must have been months old. We bought garlic that appeared to look ok from the outside, however, there were rotting and moldy cloves inside.  I've never seen garlic with moldy cloves.  They had rotten tomatoes with wrinkled skin and mold.  When I got home the onions we bought looked very old and past their prime when I cut into them.

Overall the store was extremely dirty and picked over. The back corner near where the dairy items are smelled the absolute worst like a dumpster full of garbage in the summer sun.  The meat and seafood area also looked dirty and had unappetizing smells.  I'm not even sure the foods are safe coming from Kroger unless they are prepackaged and filled with preservatives.   I wouldn't trust anything sold at this store that isn't shelf stable.

Edit: when I was at this store i needed to pic up some melatonin supplements. They were buy one get one, so I got two.  I opened one right away, however, I went to open the second bottle and now I see the seal was already opened and the contents appeared to have been tampered with.

KROGER SELLS UNSAFE PHARMACY ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN TAMPERED WITH, THE HAVE LITERAL ROTTING FOODS ON THE SHELVES AND THE STORE SMELLS LIKE A DUMPSTER.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!; I refuse to believe this store has that high of a rating. It's honestly impressive how terrible this place is. The worst part are the employees. At least at the front end, they get paid to just stand and do nothing. When I go in there are never any regular check outs open, only self checkouts, so if you have an entire cart full of groceries, good luck.
It's astonishing too, to see when people are struggling at the self checkouts, that the employees do NOTHING to intervene. They just sit and watch people struggle, they can't even be bothered to get people into an organized line. They would rather just watch everyone get pissed off and fend for themselves.
It's been this way for years so I doubt anything will ever change with this awful store.; It is 1230 on 2-23-2024.

They didn't smile, didn't seem to care about my family & put us in a confused situation because when I asked them, ""Can I use my parents phone app for free coffee & Friday freebie?"" Both female employees responded, ""As long as you have their phones & apps, just have us scan them."" However, upon checkout, one of the female employees replied, ""I was misunderstood by your question. So, you NEED your parents to come inside because it's one phone & customer at a time."" I had to put my parents coffee back and/or pay for them. That's the 2nd Worcester nouria that my parents never want me to go to for their free coffee by the app because the employees seem to be rude & uncooperative about my parents not being able to come in due to public phobias. Therefore, I'll never go back there again either (with the 2 female employees). They work at least between 9:30AM to 1PM on Fridays. My parents & I feel that we were treated unfairly especially on Friday the 13th in September of 2024. The employees need to have informed us of the ""One phone per person policy."" Before when I asked, ""Do they need to come inside?""     ""No, just type in their phone number from the app."" Then, they admitted, ""I misunderstood you. One person & phone number in the store at a time.""     The employees should not flip-flop their words from a ""Yes"" to ""No"" after I specifically ask, ""Do they need to be with me?"" It's misleading & confusing to my parents & I. No customer should be told, ""It's okay."" And then, ""No, they have to be present with you."" I'm not going to that Worcester nouria again due to the employees changing their minds on their policies. If you go here, be ready to be lied to — like my bad experience.; This is a really nice gas station. The guy working the counter was really nice. They have bathrooms.

Update: 06-05-24: asked to speak with manager on duty, he was too busy talking over me to care about the words I was trying to say when he started talking over me several times.

Final Thoughts
This location needs some TLC.; Super nice, helpful associate.  Clean store.; Strategically located at major N. Dallas intersection of Coit Rd. and 635/LBJ Freeway. Has a fast food taco restaurant attached. Stocks most all the things you want at a convenience store when you need to get gas off 635/LBJ. And, the restroom is ordinarily in acceptable condition. Typical (competitive for the area)- but not discount gas prices. Better than some similar in the area, all things considered.; The place is ghetto, the parking lot is full of garbage, the pumps look run down, dirty, and the fuel prices higher than other stations nearby.

About 7 hours ago, i couldn't get gas, due to pumps BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH! 😭😂  (actually not blue; black, so is this Linux or DOS?🤔)

When there's a computer error preventing the purchase of gas, that's a problem. The future is doomed! 😢😁

I'm unsure if this has anything to do with the recent CrowdStrike Global IT disaster affecting other systems, but i went out of my way to go to this location, because it is cleaner and less homeless-populated at 230am.  It probably eventually worked itself out, but i didn't have hours to wait.

Anyway, i thought I'd share photos (at different stages) of the boot-up\restart pump protocol. Chime in if you're familiar with this!

UPDATE: Frustrated, i discovered I left my gas cap there. Spent $17.31 at Pep Boys for an arguably, better gas cap! 🤦🏾😁; Prices are wrong and if you don’t pay attention they will steal from you.

She stated loves wont let her close the area. Oh well refund given! Thank you. Last issue,, they only had one six pack of Corona left but someone took a bottle out of the pack. I asked the cashier if they could take something off because of the missing bottle, she says no we will charge you the full amount. How are you going to charge me for six bottle when they're only five inside?; Probably the worst Loves I've been to. Most of them are extremely clean. This place is pretty messy, then you get into the restroom and 2 urinals are out of order, 1 stall is out of order, the rest look like it's been a day or two since they've been cleaned, sink ain't much better with one faucet broken and the other two dirty. 18 dollars is what they charge for a shower and as I walk in the door there's dirty boot prints on the floor, shower still has soap from previous guest, nail clippings and hair in the sink and literal smeared feces in the bowl and on the seat of the toilet. 100% unacceptable.; This Loves is the absolute worst. Stopped by 06/14/24 9:50pm Nobody seems to want to work. The diesel register is empty with a line of people waiting. I asked the cashier at the regular register for help and she said she didn’t work on the diesel side. We could see that three people were in the office and neither came out to help customers. The cashier I spoke to said the managers name is Justin. Finally two female employees that had been taking trash out came inside to cash us out. Seems like management is doing a terrible job.

I ordered 5 steak tacos with cheese and they forgot to put cheese on one of them. That's not the worst part. They gave me tuna fish instead of steak. They tried coloring it to look like steak. But you can fool a person that grew up on struggle meals.; Great place for burgers and tacos made to order at a great price.; Best tacos in Dallas. For real. I used to be a Yelp Elite.

Because the cleanliness of public restrooms is my pet peeve, I was extremely impressed. Thank you, QT. I appreciate it; This QT is always busy and the staff manages to handle two customers at one time. The store is well kept in and out.
I give four stars because I preferred the layout of the store before the remodel. The new layouts makes it hard for consumers to walk from one side of the store due to paying customers in line.
Not a very well thought out floor layout.; Unfortunately it’s not the friendliest store, if you park in a parking spot there’s only trash cans on the sides  of the store so you’ll have to walk a little ways to throw something away.

They are always always out of the frozen cappuccino or the machine is broke just like the picture shows. Why even have it in the store if it’s never gonna work. I come here a lot because I live close by and I have a 20 percent chance of actually getting frozen cappuccino

You have a 50 percent chance of having a good experience as far as the staff goes because  they are either too busy talking to each other behind the counter and won’t even acknowledge you when you’re checking out because they are  continuing the conversation with each other or they’re going to be out of something you want

The store is clean in general but there a lot of times they’re out of stock of 12 pack cokes and other items I get on a regular basis.

I try to leave honest reviews not just based on my first impression  unless it’s noted in the description. I just feel that this QT is lacking either good management and making sure everything is working correctly and making sure employees pay more attention to the customers or maybe Managment  just don’t know what’s going on when they are not there .; Great place and great service

I recently added the inside with the actual look inside the kit.; Disappointing. This location had everything neat and organized. Restroom was fairly clean and everything seemed to be well stocked. Stopped in for breakfast. Decided on the egg, cheese and brisket taco. Save your money for something else.   I purchased 2 and they both were the same. Had a fair amount of egg but the cheese and brisket could not be found. If unfolding and looking inside there was a spot or two of something that could have been brisket or cheese. And you could taste just a faint flavor of something that resembled
brisket. But if I guessed what this was without someone telling me after eating it I would just have said it was an egg taco. Because that's really all that was in it.; This is a very convenient location off of Hampton and I-20. This location is very clean and I can find everything.  I came into the store for coffee and donuts which were hot and fresh and readily available.  The store of handicap accessible and restrooms. Very clean store with great personnel. The parking lot was nite over crowded And easily accessible from the road. Also you canget lotto tickets here.  This will be my 1st choice when it comes to a Quck Trip from now on. Greatly recommended.; The Carmel frappuccino from their kitchen sucked today.  I look forward to my frappuccinos but this one may make me think twice to ever go over there to purchase again. No Carmel flavor and it tastes straight up sour. I could not bare to finish the drink it was so bad. So disappointing."

Easy in and out and nice parking are my reasons for shopping here. Gimmick pricing, making you buy 3-5 to get a discount or buy 2 get one free, are frustrating.  The store tends to be poorly stocked. If they are out of an item, often after a buy multiple sale, it may be weeks or months before it is again stocked.; I recently visited this supermarket and picked up some ingredients to make a scrumptious dinner. I got some rice, salad, T-Bone steak (which was on sale, hello bargain!), some potato, and oh, some fresh strawberries for dessert.

The store was super easy to navigate and I found everything I needed in a jiffy. I have to admit, I was feeling pretty cool strolling through the aisles, checking off items from my list like a pro. The checkout process was smooth and quick, no long lines to worry about.

Now let's talk about that T-Bone steak - it was the star of the show! I cooked it to perfection and it was so juicy and flavorful. I even impressed myself with my culinary skills, if I do say so myself.

But back to Tom Thumb - overall, I had a great experience. The prices were reasonable and the selection was fantastic.

The potato wedges were DRENCHED IN OIL AND THE INSIDES OF THEM WERE YELLOW!!! THE CATFISH WAS TOUGH BECAUSE IT WAS A DAY OLD BUT WAS REHEATED. The employee was RUDE and said not one word when I said thank you as all of those ladies back there are except the older lady. The Manager is even worse! Her name was Renea. She placed me on hold and next thing I know a guy from home goods answers then tells me to call back and dial extension 1200 WHICH YOU CANNOT DO!!  PLEASE AVOID THIS LOCATION!!!

Worth the stop. Get their card and get fuel discounts too!; Such rude staff. I called looking for my moms lost wallet AFTER the fact that they hung up on her when she called multiple times, because she used a relay service as she is a hard of hearing person. The interpreter EXPLAINS as soon as they answer the phone, but instead the staff were too impatient and hung up multiple times. When I called and spoke with a lousy excuse for a “manager” she clearly didn’t care when i explained about my mom being hung up on for two days in a row. This isn’t even the only part.

I was told they were in desperate need of a cake decorator. I was told when I was hired there was possibility for growth in the company, that was the first lie. I was hired on during their busiest time of year for cake decorating. Graduation. I did numerous beautiful cakes for them. I called out once because my 8 year old daughter was sick and throwing up and once more because there was fraudulent charges on my card and I need to sort it all out with my bank. Mind you I was part of the union while employed here. Well they pulled me into the office while I was already 6 hours into my 8 hour shift and fired me. The reason was because I called out too much. I called the union and they said if they had waited one more day to fire me I could’ve got my job back because it was not a justifiable reason to me. But they waited till I hit  exactly 60 days to fire me. They basically used me to get through their busiest time of year for cakes. The union representative that I spoke with, had these exact words to say “they did you dirty!” They just didn’t want to pay a full time cake decorator. I am highly disappointed with this company. Definitely will never be shopping there again. They also paid very little for a cake decorator but it was something and I needed that to provide for my kids. So if you are thinking of working for this company please reconsider.; Carol is rude/unpleasant and unprofessional. I asked for assistance finding an item and she didn’t even bother to look at me awhile very nasty blurting out it’s in the next aisle.  Completely disregard my need. As customer service employee she should have better service! Highly disappointed in the service received. I tried to address the issue with Tammy whom I was told is the store manager upon calling I was transferred to someone else on top of hearing them pick up and hang up the phone. Poor customer service!!!; If you're gonna get groceries get something from here using the Kroger members card, saves a bunch of money. The employees kind of suck though, checkout takes forever.; Is there anyway NOT to get Berl or Burl for the grocery pickup??. He’s always so mad that we come and he is always so unpleasant. He shakes his head as he’s loading the groceries and mumbles under his breath. He thinks people can’t hear or he doesn’t care. Does anyone know if you can request not to get him. I’ve tried giving the benefit of the doubt nuts he’s so unpleasant everytime. It’s sad people can treat customers like this.; Terrible staff.

Title: Affordable Gas Station with Inconsistent Rolling Paper Availability: A Mixed Experience

Introduction: Finding a reliable gas station that offers affordable fuel prices is a boon for motorists. However, the occasional unavailability of rolling papers can be a disappointment for smokers who rely on them. This review aims to provide an overview of a particular gas station's merits as an economical option, while addressing the issue of inconsistent rolling paper availability.

Affordable Fuel Prices: The gas station in question has consistently maintained competitive fuel prices, making it an attractive option for cost-conscious drivers. Its commitment to offering affordable gasoline has earned the trust and loyalty of many customers. The consistently low prices make it a reliable choice for budget-conscious individuals seeking to minimize their expenses on fuel.

Inconsistent Rolling Paper Availability: One drawback of this gas station is the irregular availability of rolling papers. While they may be stocked on some days, there are instances when customers are disappointed to find them out of stock. This inconsistency poses an inconvenience for smokers who rely on the convenience of purchasing rolling papers alongside their fuel needs. It is important to note, however, that the station does not specialize in tobacco-related products, and thus, rolling papers may not be a priority in their inventory management.

Potential Solutions: To address the issue of inconsistent rolling paper availability, there are a few possible suggestions. Firstly, the gas station management could consider establishing a more consistent supply chain for rolling papers, ensuring that they are adequately stocked to meet customer demand. This would require better inventory management and closer communication with suppliers.

Another solution would involve informing customers about the availability of rolling papers through signage or online platforms. By providing up-to-date information, smokers would be able to plan their visits accordingly, minimizing disappointment when rolling papers are unavailable.

Additionally, the gas station could explore partnering with nearby convenience stores or tobacco shops to ensure a steady supply of rolling papers. This collaboration would benefit both parties by offering customers a one-stop solution for their fuel and smoking accessory needs.

Conclusion: In summary, the gas station under review offers commendable advantages such as affordable fuel prices, attracting customers who prioritize cost-effectiveness. However, the inconsistent availability of rolling papers poses a challenge for smokers who rely on convenient access to such products. By implementing better inventory management practices and exploring collaborations with nearby retailers, the gas station could enhance the overall customer experience. With a more reliable supply of rolling papers, this affordable gas station could better cater to the diverse needs of its patrons, providing a more well-rounded service.; Quick fill up; great; Good place; They only sell regular gas"

The people that work at this gas station are so friendly.  This is my go to gas station in Central Phoenix.; There's a Circle K around the corner from my house, but instead I drive 3 miles to this nice Chevron. Why? Because every Circle K I've been to is disgusting - urine smell, sticky floors, bums and gum (Saving one nickel for low quality gasoline isn't worth it to me).  This Chevron is clean, friendly staff, and the pumps always work, aren't gross to touch and aren't vandalized.  I also come here to refill my BBQ propane tank.; Do not ever use this place.. Bethany home road and 7th avenue The manager a Latino Lady has absolutely zero care and zero heart. I don't understand how someone can have zero sympathy for man or animal. She was in full violation of the law by knowingly subjecting a service dog to danger or death. Absolutely shocked at that person and she was wearing a Manager label. I have been getting fuel at that station for over 10 years. Today I had misplaced my wallet and my gas light was on for several miles. I thought of I could just get to that gas station I could stay cool on the shade and if my vehicle died while I waited for someone to come  bring me a credit card or cash then me and my service dog who is getting older and really needs to stay out of the heat. We would be on a good safe place. I was very wrong. I parked in the shade and it was an unmarked parking area but the manager told me I could not sit there Even after I explained to her my situation she said I don't care this is private property. I said but I have my dog in the back and she's older she needs to stay cool My engine's going to die soon while I wait for someone to bring me some money for gas I said I can't expose her to the heat like this. She said I don't care point blank I do not care this is private property. So I left and I'll never return there again and I'll make sure everybody I know never goes to that place and I know thousands of people in  the animal rescue community would be very upset. I also believe she broke the law the ADA law telling me I can't have my service animal in that position is no sign there. Not sure what's happening anymore but why they hate but she couldn't find it in her heart at all just to be some sort of sympathetic just for a little bit and I asked her that too and she said no she didn't care. She wouldn't care if we died out on the street. And it's not like we look like homeless people I was driving a Mercedes so she's going to treat us like this I can't imagine what she's going to treat other people that are below her because she has that attitude that she's better than everybody else and it sucks she shouldn't be in that position that she's in managing people."

ACTUAL PRICE OF REGULAR IS LISTED BELOW THE ""CAR WASH PRICED FUEL"". To receive the lower priced fuel, you must buy the Ultimate Carwash, which is rather pricy...; Actually a lie. Their giant sign out front says a Price for regular gas like every other station except their number is actually $.25 higher than that, that number you can only get with a purchase of one of their $35 single car washes! Which definitely don’t seem worth it. Another strike against them was Google maps said their price was $.10 cheaper than it actually was, Which actually isn’t the price that you get with the car wash so who knows what’s up there.

At sucks to be lied to by a freaking gas station but I guess that’s what the world has come to.; I waited in line to pay for 5 minutes and the cashier seemed to be chatting with a customer or waiting for something. The customer service at this gas station is not bad but it is not existent."

I very rarely do reviews, but this one was necessary. How does a gas station fail at providing the service it's supposed to provide? Excellent question! You make eye contact MULTIPLE TIMES with a customer standing patiently for you to finish reading whatever you were reading, and then writing whatever you were writing, and then grabbing something from the printer, then going back to sit down to do something else, etc. I stood for a total of 4 minutes without him even acknowledging me with a wave or a ""one second "" gesture. Nope. Pretend I wasn't even there. Pretend that you didn't look up and see me immediately upon arrival, or the three other times I noticed you look to see if I still was there. I have never been so annoyed with somebody before. I left. Never got anything from them. No gas, no snacks. Screw this place!; I have been getting my gas at the Safeway Gas station on Greenway and Tatum since it opened about fifteen years ago.  They are very friendly and service oriented.

So when I tried to clean them with the windshield wipers, everything smeared everywhere and I could hardly see. I noticed their was no window cleaner buckets or squeegee outside, so I went to ask about it. I was told they had to get rid of them because of the new town regulations regarding bear activity. I did not want to buy wiper fluid for a rental, so I was very grateful when Donald offered me some glass cleaner and paper towels to use. Donald even took care of my trash as well, I was very grateful for the service provided!; Matt was very helpful.  I had a slow leak in one of my tires and was facing an 8 hour drive home. Matt stayed after his work shift, found the screw in the tire causing the problem, and fixed it in 5 minutes. Made it home and the tire is still good to go. I also was charged a very reasonable amount for the work. Thanks, Matt!; I first stopped at this location for a pack of smokes. I knew when I walked in the door these were ""My People.""

I traveled back down the mountain,  wipped into the station where the technician put it back into place in about 5 mins...and didn't ask a fee although I tipped him with the available cash I had on hand. I (and the three ladies with me) was SO RELIEVED AND THANKFUL! Great place & great people; Shout out to Steve at Gatlinburg gas!  He was so helpful and informative.  Traveling in a rental car and needed guidance on engine issue.  Because of him I made it home safe as he helped me with the oil change and instructed me on what to look for in the future!  Thank you so much!; Love how professional the whole team is when it comes to their service. Matt is the best mechanic you’ll ever meet and he does the job right!

Fortunately I had pulled over to check on the vibration and saw that the wholes around the lug nuts had pretty much melted and 2 of the lugs had sheared off. I lost the wheel turning around to move the boat off the road.

I unhooked the boat and went back into town to Eller's. (recommended by a cop who checked on me.) I pretty much figured they would load the boat up on a flatbed and take it into town to fix and I'd have to return for it in a few days.

He came out, lifted my trailer enough to evaluate the situation and decided all I needed was a new hub and rim. Mind you it took a few hours to track down a rim that would work as they didn't have one at the shop. Once they found the rim, they used my tire and went out to put it back on.

Overall I was amazed at how they prioritized getting me fixed and under way so quickly. Their cost was VERY reasonable, a minimum of $50 less than I expected. In addition to the low cost, they saved me 4 hours driving time for the return trip as well as a tank of gas.

Very happy with their service. If they were in my town, I'd definitely become a regular!!!; I can’t even begin to express our gratitude for Eller’s. Tommy went out of his way to tow our van from the boonies to his shop and had it fixed within the hour. Everyone at the shop was kind and professional and entertained our little ones while we waited. Thank God for people who care about their fellow man!; I had a couple tie rod ends get loose on my trip. I bought the parts and they changed them out quick and for a really good price on labor compared to where I live. Thanks again Eller's!; We needed help on a Sunday night when a shifter cable broke on our Corvette in a very remote location. Tommy towed us, dropped us off where we were staying, ordered the part and got us back on the road! What a kind, honest person and business!; We were riding The Tail of Dragon...made it to the top of the hill when we completely died.  Thank God we were able to coast into the parking lot of the Deal's Gap Resort.  Unable to start with a jump, called Good Sam's and they called Eller's and a very nice guy in a really nice truck picked us up and hauled our H-D VRSCA, back across the Tail of Dragon.   He even helped my husband get the motorcycle loaded back into our box trailer.  Thank you, so much for all your help."

A lot of food, coffee, and snacks. It also includes a little gift shop.; My rewards card doesn’t seem to work. It’s been that way the last couple times I went to pilot, but everytime they tell me it’s fine it works. This particular time, the manager told me it gives the discount at the pump, not at the cash register for how many cents saving, like everywhere else in the USA. I sent the the pump, I was buying diesel, I told the manager that. It appears that the numbers of the pump on the big sign above them doesn’t represent diesel pumps just gas, so it’s a different pump. I went back in because I didn’t know that. Not like everywhere else. I told the cashiers, 2 or them, the pump didn’t work and now I am worried my 60 bucks might be on an open pump, or another pump. Neither cashier even noticed I was there, like I was invisible, is that the new way to deal with a customer who’s annoyed at how things are working? We ignore it? Then I asked the bakery woman for a manager, the woman that originally cared my card showed up, and was the only person in the entire store that cared that I was missing 60 dollars and the pump didn’t work and I was walking in and out of the pilot a few times trying to fix the problem. She told me it was pump 9 not pump 5 that is said in a big number above it. I started pumping and the discount wasn’t even there, so I stopped after a few gallons because I am a price shopper and it made me further annoyed with pilot. I am into posting this because I want them to fix their service and get rid of their entitled employees. And so you know it’s an issue there if you have an issue!; I did my 34 hour break here. Showers were decent, store was clean. Only problem I had was both nights I was approached multiple times from people begging for money. Looked like drug addicts. The woman was tweakin and all fidgety. The guy was creepy and snuck up on my drivers door while I was getting ready to go get dinner. He got mad when I slammed my door shut.; They install the pump however they want, there is no order, drivers leave and go, the gas station employees do not react, nothing works inside, no drinks, no boiling water, very bad service at this gas station, I do not recommend stopping by."
