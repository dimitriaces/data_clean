Great little store with a little bit of everything.; Great little market near the hotel I was staying at. Visited multiple times because it is convenient, clean, friendpy, and reasonably priced.; Best market! So thankful they came to downtown. They have everything you would need from fresh food to liquor. The owner and staff are so friendly and always make sure the fruit is freshly cut and packaged each morning when we stop by. Don’t know what we would do without this place. Great prices too!; They have Dom Perignon! Picked up some last night. That in itself is a 5 star rating for this great store!"

There is a very real Arizona Department of Liquor Licenses and Control. They test stores, frequently, in the blind!

Solid and convenient. Friendly staff. Prices seem to rise very slowly.... Wide variety/selection of aDuLt beverages and smoke accessories.

I spoke with the owner,  very early one morning, recently, told him about my 2 very old liquor decanters!
1 Full, 1 not. LOL!

Not for Sale...thx; They always seem to have 2-3 customers in there anytime I go.  When I'm creating a new drink, I like this place because when it's your turn, they give you the attention you need.  And they always seem friendly which can be a challenge when you have such a ... variety of clients.; Always a great atmosphere when I walk in. The staff is very friendly, and the owner carl always tries to get items they don't sell, if there's enough demand for it.; Wanted some random beers so I figured with the reviews this would be the place... it did not disappoint. I found the prickly pear vodka I've been wanting to try and of course I went with some 903's... I love their Slushy style beers frozen for a few hours, so damn good in this hot weather!"

It was clean, and the employees all greeted me. Checkout person really helped me out. Got me signed up for their club membership, so I got a bottle of wine and the second bottle for 5 cents!; There is a Total Wine and More 6 minutes away from this location, save your time and frustration and just go there instead! They have better selection and better customer service anyway. I went to this BevMo and purchased a Monster energy drink, a Redbull, a cigar, and a Jaeger shooter. Made it all the way back home (30 minutes later) and the Jeager is not in the bag??? Tore the car apart to make sure it didn’t end up under a seat or something during the drive and called the store 5 times to see if they have it there but apparently everyone was too busy to answer my calls…. I will not be returning.; I’ve been ghosted by the gopuff warehouse a couple times .. this is unacceptable.. correct your hours or hire people that work! Wasting good people’s time and money !!

Management team on the floor were super helpful and they helped me without having to find someone in the very back of the store. They have a variety of different products and the prices are AMAZING!!! Please go Visit ❤️❤️❤️; Good sampling service. Good selection of products.; Besides this being a great liquor store , one of the workers personally helped me for more than 30 minutes. She let me taste multiple tequilas ( since that’s what I came for ) and helped me find the one that was right for me. I really appreciated her help and will be coming back even if it’s for a basic alcohol.; They are 5 when they have my brew. When they don’t a 3.. haha. My fav.

We stopped in for a late lunch and drinks and overall was really impressed! The old fashioned was on point and the charcuterie board and chicken cesar salad was good as well.
My only complaint is in regards to one of the food runners which offered more toast points for the charcuterie board, which we asked our server (who was great by the way) to grab for us. When we got the bill we were charged an additional 4 dollars for them.  If I could only deduct a fraction of a star I would but this place is already pretty expensive so I feel like it was a little ingenious and didn't want it to be anything other than a minor annoyance on an otherwise great time.
Overall I would recommend this business; This is where it all started for them. Great location to get local support. The selection of spirits and beer are great the the wine is good. The walk in Himidor for cigars is well stocked and has great selection as well. The bar area is nice for what it is. Over all not a bad place at all. The service is hit and miss and some of the staff seem lost.; Stopped here while staying in Scottsdale.  They have everything you need, including vacation friendly sizes of most products, a wide variety of beverages, including mixers, even bottled water.  I asked where I could get fresh limes and they had them in the store!  Very helpful salespeople.  Great experience.; Excellent place in the heart of Scottsdale!  They have a great selection of beer, liquor, cigars and they even have food trucks! Awesome outdoor patios with plenty of seating. Came here with a few friends and socialized over some drinks and cigars. Had an amazing time and definitely recommend this place!; The place is awesome. I can't say enough.
Great place to grab a drink and hangout. If you're just looking for drinks to go, this place has a HUGE selection.
Do yourself a favor and check this place out.
Heads up, if you're looking for the pizza you are going to need to head to the Scottsdale location.
This location does seem to always have food trucks outside though."

Act I: The BevMo Conundrum
Intrepid duo Sir Sip-a-Lot and Lady Liquorice stood before the towering shelves of BevMo, their eyes wide with anticipation. There it stood—the majestic 1.75-liter bottle of grapefruit-infused delight. But alas! The price tag read $32, which was more than a medieval dragon’s ransom. Sir Sip-a-Lot scratched his head, wondering if he’d accidentally stumbled into a gold-plated distillery.
“Fear not, Lady Liquorice!” he declared. “We shall seek refuge at Total Wine, where the prices flow like a gentle stream of budget-friendly nectar!”
And so, they galloped (okay, maybe staggered) to Total Wine, where the grapefruit gods smiled upon them. The same bottle—$24.99! Sir Sip-a-Lot did a little jig, and Lady Liquorice high-fived a passing mermaid. Victory was within their grasp!
Act II: The Price-Matching Paradox
Back at BevMo, our heroes presented their discovery. “Behold!” cried Sir Sip-a-Lot, waving the Total Wine receipt like a wizard’s scroll. “We demand price-matching!”
But the BevMo gatekeeper frowned. “Nay, noble imbibers!” he thundered. “This is not an online price! You must conjure an in-store price from thin air!”
Lady Liquorice raised an eyebrow. “In-store price?” she scoffed. “Do we look like wizards who can summon price tags at will?”
The gatekeeper remained unmoved. “Only with an in-store price shall the price-matching spell be cast!”
Act III: The Unexpected Twist
Our heroes huddled, their minds sharper than a freshly cut lemon wedge. “**What if we draw a grapefruit on parchment and label it 'In-Store Price?” suggested Sir Sip-a-Lot.; We went in to get some tequila for a party and the associates there were very polite and helpful. They explained the different processes used for different tequilas and recommended on a bottle keeping in mind our budget. They were not pushy just very helpful which I appreciate since I don't know much about alcohol at all.; Straightforward layout, good selection. Prices are a little higher than grocery stores.; What a great selection . Had everything we needed . Great store ."

🎃 Happy Halloween 🎃; I recently had a chance to stop into in to search for something to try while visiting the city. I loved the selections they provided, and they had some very rare items on the shelf. I was able to locate some of my favorite Tequilas to take home with is always a plus in my book. The employees there were attentive and offered help if they thought you were overwhelmed l, which could be easily done. I will be back."

After getting back to the car we found them wedged under the seat, and went back in to let her know and to thank her for helping us. She was so friendly even after we told her we just essentially wasted her time because we found them. She didn’t hesitate to smile and make us feel welcome.; Very friendly and helpful staff. They stopped stocking a wine I loved so they special ordered it in for me. Best prices too!; Don’t be mislead by its name. They do have countless wines but all the liquors, beers, mixers are all in one place. It’s such eye-opening experience if you are first time there to be shocked the variety of alcohols I don’t know for decades.; It would be great if they made allocated bourbons more accessible for mid level customers. I'm 3 hours away from the Valley and don't have the opportunity to shop there as often as I like. But, I do spend money when I do. The bourbon selection is above average and the Scotch selection is good. The employees do try to steer you to their brands as much as possible."

I saw a TikTok about the pumpkin flavored Buzzball Biggies so naturally I had to pick one up. Of course they’re out of stock, but no big deal, I decide on the mango one instead. Wait in line to pay for it, the cashier asks me for my ID, no problem. She then points at the 11 year old with me and asks “is she yours?”
I’m kinda taken aback and let her know that she’s my step daughter. She then proceeds to call for a supervisor for an ID check.
The supervisor comes over, the cashier says “she’s her step daughter”, and the supervisor looks at me and says they can’t serve me. I say “you ID children????” And the supervisor then proceeds to tell me “well if she was yours then we could, but she’s not.”
I’ve never been so offended. For someone to tell me that in front of her is beyond disgusting.

The Total Wine policy states “ To help in this effort, we don’t allow any person under the age of 21 to enter our store unless accompanied by an adult guardian of legal drinking age*. All parties in a group may be required to present identification. If you appear to be age 30 or under, our team members will ask for identification to ensure we are doing everything we can to prevent sales to minors. It’s our responsibility to our neighbors and the community.

*Please note: In Indiana, individuals under the age of 21 are not permitted in the store”

So if they let me enter the store with her, why would I not be allowed to purchase anything? If I’m allowed in the store with her, then by Total Wine’s policy, I’m her adult guardian of legal drinking age.
If parental rights need to be verified, maybe post that somewhere.
As a step parent, I’ve done and am doing everything to be the parent for MY CHILDREN and I have never been so disrespected by anyone for being a step parent.; My first visit to a Total Wine & More and I was amazed at the inventory they carry! It was fun going up and down the aisles  seeing all the selections to choose from, you name it, they have it. The staff was friendly and very helpful.  I highly recommend for your adult beverage wants,  needs, and discoveries!; First time experiencing racism in America. Sept 27th, around 6 pm PST. I go pick a couple of bottles of wine after 5 mins of shopping around. I come to the counter to pay for it. I am told to wait for the manager to arrive because apparently I was colluding with a friend to purchase more than what is allowed for a single party. Turns out this ""friend"" is another person of the same race as I, who was talking to another person of the same race. So I guess all people of my race look alike. This manager was perhaps was the most condescending, rude and incompetent person I have ever encountered. She even mocked my protests to my face. The store clerk is witness to all of this. I wonder if she makes the same association with every other races. If people of the same race are in the store at the same time, she will consider them all one party?

I can't believe the gall of this manager to double down on her mistake rather than make a concession that she could be wrong. She falsely accuses me, patronizes me by saying that she knows I am colluding with a friend, talks down to me, mock me and then expect me to be completely calm about the whole thing.

I came back home and curled up and felt a knot in my stomach for 3 hours and even after 24 hours, I am still in a dazed state. This wasn't even overt racism, I cannot imagine what other folks who face racism on a daily basis have to go through.

I am sure your business will run just fine even with my justified outburst in this review and I understand racism isn't illegal in America. I am just disappointed that this will continue to happen. If anyone from Total Wine management sees this post, please investigate it. You have cameras in the entire place, I know you are required by law to keep video recordings for a certain period of time.; The staff was absolutely wonderful and very helpful to me.

My brother had asked for help and the man told him he would send someone over since we wanted a tequila that was locked up. We were waiting for a bit and the staff called Dan was just at a register, they did not verbalize that they were doing anything else or let us know they were still trying to locate someone. We got help from a nice young man who passed by. My brother decided to tell Dan calmly that if he didn't want to help that is all he had to say. Dan got disgruntled and almost yelled saying he had instructed my brother to ask customer service for the bottle but the young gentleman that helped had to go get it. So please improve communication because we are not mind readers. If he in fact had asked for someone else to bring up the bottle he simply could have said so when we got to the register. He did not even acknowledge us when we were checking out. Also please have him be calm because feedback was provided in a respectful manner it was not yelled and no profanity was used. Dan should not work in customer service because you should never raise your voice or yell at a customer especially if that customer did not yell at you. We will come back because everyone else was nice and willing to help but we hope if we do see Dan, his customer service has improved.; The one star is for the employee Dan, a bald headed mid 40's looking older man, stoner blue eyes, that seem like he's had a mid life crisis, or is just unhappy with his life and has just given up on it.  I asked for help in purchasing a 1942 DonJulio tequila bottle, in which Dan said I will send an employee to help, however help never came, and it took the help of his coworker who saw me standing there to offer me the bottle. Once I checked out I saw Dan still just standing there doing nothing but looking at his computer and said to him that if he did not want to help out in the future to just say it and be clear, in which he became verbally abusive yelling saying he had put the bottle to the side, however he did not realize that his coworker is the one that got the bottle and brought it to the register while he just did nothing and lied like I didn't see it. Overall the store is nice and other staff is helpful and friendly. But I should advise that Dan control his temper not every customer will be as calm as me. I will give this store another try and hope for a better experience.; Love the store on Waddell and the 303 in Surprise, AZ. They have spirits I had to order online to get. The checkout was very good. She was so helpful with my account and what I have for rewards.
Definitely going back."

Prices are fairly good, but the sales are where it’s at. The tasting bar is a great way to try new drinks.; This is my least favorite Total Wine location in Tucson due to the higher pricing- surprisingly, a few items are more expensive than at the other TW location- and the hit-or-miss customer service. Additionally, the managers are inconsistent and put up a fight when asked to price match, which seems contrary to corporate policy and suggests a lack of training. Unfortunately, due to my business, I spend quite a bit of money here and have their highest status, but I will be looking for another liquor shop to fulfill my business needs.

I've encountered rude cashiers at this location, and even some of the white-shirt employees lack customer service skills. One named Tyler comes to mind; he shouldn't be in a customer-facing role as he tends to be rude/dismissive, fortunately he is often hiding by the customer service area or chit-chatting with coworkers. He clearly needs retraining or should find a non-customer service job. Given my recent interactions at this location, I'll be looking for another place to fulfill my wine needs.; Saw another review about some homophobia going on in this establishment and found out how true that was today. I went in to purchase a bottle of wine with my sister (who also had a valid ID) and got quite literally yelled out at the checkout and told that ""we were lucky"" and that they ""felt like being nice today""  by letting us purchase the wine there. We were both so shocked at how we were treated in this store when nothing was said prior to the treatment.; I’ve never been to better liquor store than this one. The most inventory and variety in beer, wine, liquors ever. People uniformly nice and knowledgeable too.; I usually have a pleasant experience when going to Total Wine but not today.  Almost every employee was rude and unhelpful.

It’s not that hard to be helpful and say hello. Do better."

I was loving the walk in humidor here. I didn't want to leave. My wife had to call me on my cell phone to get me out of there.

This is based off of news articles that has been published and multiple lawsuits in the US and UK.  The self-checkout technology is not a reliable technology.  If you value your freedom and not to be fasley accused of stealing, stay clear of this store because there are no other options.; My rating is the result of a telephone conversation I had with someone identifying themselves as the 24th Street and Baseline ""Store Manager"". During the recent renovation of your 24th Street and Baseline location, several construction trailers were parked in the parking spots designated for disabled customers. When I emailed my question as to why the trailers couldn't be parked in the lot on the west side of the building. As a once frequent customer,
I noticed that this lot is least used by Wal-Mart customers.

I received a telephone call from someone stating he was the manager, and that Wal-Mart didn't decide where to park the trailers. It was the decision of the construction company.  Besides, the store provided several temporary disabled parking spaces in their regular parking to compensate for the ""disabled"" parking spaces that the construction trailers were using. He said that all I had to do was look for the orange buckets (???). He had a cavalier attitude of ""What's the big deal!?"" Further stating besides the construction company would ONLY be there for two to three weeks.

I explained:

1. The new parking spaces did not meet federal/state requirements. The law requires only one(1) handicap parking space in close proximity to the front entrance for every 25 parking spaces. The new temporary parking spaces were further than the online customers parking and the space designated police parking.

2. Why is Wal-Mart allowing a construction company to dictate where their trailer should be parked and, thereby, where Wal-Mart's disable customers cannot utilize spaces designated by law? Wal-Mart made it convenient for the company you're paying to do a construction job, and inconvenient for your customers who support your business? Make that make sense......

Clearly, Fry's valued their customers. Fry's, directly across the street, had construction and upgrade to their location during the same time period, and the construction trailers parked furthest from the front entrance.

Lack knowledge is not something I would hold against someone, however, his tone of voice and his attitude was the driving force in me writing this review.; I will not go to Walmart ever again
Walmart excepts us to scan our own items then bag our groceries and the prices just keep rising 😳.
It only has two Cashiers and most of the time they are not there. Always short staff, and I usually get my own cart from the parking lot

Waited 15 minutes and then stood in line at the counter to be told when you check in at the kiosk, you also have to let someone behind the counter know you’ve checked in. Nowhere on the kiosk does it state that. Why offer an electronic check-in if you still have to talk to someone in the pharmacy?  Way to keep up on technology, Walgreens.; Was at the photo center on Friday morning and the clerk was extremely friendly. She offered to help well into her break to assist me.  Very much appreciated.; was given misinformation on several times and today was told I would have to drive approximately 25 miles to pick it up at another Walgreens.  When talking to the pharmacy manager at the green valley Continental store there was no explanation has to pqast events and no indication that the manager would follow up.; A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR ALL FUTURE AND CURRENT CUSTOMERS.

On 3/18, my Dr. prescribed an anti-anxiety medication that I was already dependent on and that I needed ASAP, and said I could pick it up that day at the pharmacy. For unknown reasons, the pharmacy said there were delays in getting the prescription. I believed my last dose I had in my possession was for 8pm, so I needed to ensure I had another dose by the morning of 3/19 or I'd go into life-threatening withdrawal and would need to eventually check into the ER.  This made the situation critical.

I called the pharmacy and expressed the emergency nature of the situation, and was told there were insurance-related issues causing the delay. Despite offering to self-pay, that option was declined with no explanation. The technician then spoke with the pharmacist and assured me that the prescription would be prioritized, and assured me it would be ready by 7:10AM the next day, if I was the first customer.

At the time, I believed I would need it by then because my morning dose is 6-8AM. However, due to a work emergency, I couldn't follow through with this plan. THANK GOD I located ONE extra pill at home, which meant my next dose would be 3/19 2PM. Withdrawal would begin by around 8-9PM if I missed it. I'd have to go to the ER to be monitored since the withdrawal is so dangerous. This gave me EXTREME anxiety to be in this situation with so little wiggle room and so little transparency from the pharmacy. But all seemed OK from here. Was it? Nope.

I had a work emergency and could not show up early. But, guess what? It didn't matter anyway, because my script was not ready at 7:10. It wasn't even ready at 11AM.

At 11:15 AM on 3/19, I hadn't received the usual text notification that it was ready. I called and, inexplicably, it was still not ready -
no one could tell me why. This triggered extreme anxiety, to the point where I approached a panic attack and cried.

After calming myself and to avoid full-blown panic, I called the pharmacy again, reiterating the urgency of the situation (which I had done since the first call) and pleading for answers and action. Following a hold, I was told that the script would be ready within the next half-hour (why did I have to plead to get this answer?). I was relieved, but furious they were putting me through this. I was still crying.

I drove there and went inside. I asked for clarification from the pharmacist regarding why this had happened because I needed to make sure it would NEVER happen again. However, his response was dismissive and unapologetic, and said it was ""it was not due until today"". This was a lie. My Dr prescribed it for the day before. I asked why the tech had told me it would be ready at 7:10AM (which didn't happen) and he just said ""the tech does not fill prescriptions, I do, he cannot tell you that"". It was clear the pharmacist was just lying and had forgotten and/or not cared.

I made sure to let them know I'd leave this review of my experience and also let them know it was clear why they had many poor reviews and a very low score. After I had my script in hand, I said the to the pharmacist ""F*** you very much, and I hope you have a bad day."" This felt quite good :) I was already walking away out of the store and he yelled ""If you're going to be an a**hole, I will call the police and have you arrested for trespassing"". Clearly, a true professional. They had wronged me, not the other way around, and I had a right to express my frustration. He just wanted to be a d***. This pharmacist was around 6'2 with an African accent, just to be clear who this was. So look out.

Throughout this ordeal, the techs showed professionalism and empathy, providing help and support where they could amidst the chaos. They were great, and I made sure to express my gratitude for their assistance in-person. I feel bad they have to to work under such a crappy pharmacist.

I'll never use Walgreens again and had all my scripts transferred to another pharmacy. I HIGHLY ADVISE YOU STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE IF YOU CAN. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU.; The pharmacy employees are generally polite and helpful when I visit. Evonne, the pharmacist who assisted me today, was sweet and attentive to be sure everything in my drive-thru order was accurate. The pharmacy team I’ve interacted with works swiftly and is extremely accurate. I don’t have any complaints and I prefer this pharmacy to the one nearest to my home. Well worth the drive for good service!"

They made our drink order EXACTLY how we wanted it!! Even though it's a stupidly picky order. And with a smile which can be rare under the circumstances! Both of them deserve raises! Thanks!!!; I freaking can’t stand this particular Target. The parking is absolutely the worst. It’s so annoying that it forced me to shop at Walmart more.

Now I have to add to my review that the shelves are empty but there’s 2 and 3 people folding close. There’s also people from what I can see just standing around. How about stalking some shelves people.

Once again I stupidly went to Target because they have papyrus cards which are awesome and the only reason I go there now. Why does target have self checkouts and not have them open 🤬; As a Target lover, this one is the best one I go to! The cashiers are super friendly and helpful, always super nice. Starbucks has some great employees always efficiently working and delivering great customer service! I do however miss one of the employees that worked at Starbucks she had blonde hair and was always there lol, she was great at cashier and making drinks, always bonding with customers and Target coworkers hope she comes back! Great store in my opinion 😁; The prices here are more expensive than the store back home in Utah. We were able to find what we needed but just surprised on how much more items costed us. Even though they are Target, they still aren't quite on Target yet.

Next time, we'll probably walk around the corner to Walmart, not that they are any better, but its Capitalism at its finest.; Self check out was a slow. Scale unable to  pick up weight of smaller produce orders causing screen to lock. Staff was busy assisting other customers. Each delay resulted in 6-10 minutes wait.   I don't appreciate creepy crawlies of this stores undercover security creeping around at every turn, pretending to shop while obviously following me 🤦. Apparently this store has a theft problem maybe cause they focus on making paying customers feel harassed instead of the shoplifters.."

I ended up going home taking a nap called in and the lady although nice every time I talked to her stated my car still won’t be done until 4:30 pm that is over a full shift. How am I missing my car that I need to make money with for over 8.5 hours when I was there before several people. I couldn’t even make an appointment online the night before because every time I clicked the option it would glitch out. At this point I feel like I need compensation for a 20 minute job that took over 8.5 hours. Worst place to get service done for your vehicle. The last trip I made had similar problems for my other tire as I was skipped over in the system due to another “glitch”. At this point I feel targeted as other cars were in and out in no time. If I can reach out to corporate about this I will. This is coming from someone who doesn’t even like to review places even if they aren’t that good. I’m a nice person but this is ridiculous to fail a customer this way. You guys cost me more money than the tire was worth next time I’ll go spend my money at discount tire where they will finish my car in at least 10 minutes for maybe $30 more than what you charge.; Thank you to Mr. Anthony Alexander he was more than great excellent customer service and the nice young lady in the deli appreciate your attention to detail this is what Walmart needs to battle with Target 🎯 my first and number one store. He helped me pick out a vacuum appreciate you. Great employees pray Walmart compensates and appreciates there good employees laughed at the door while leaving and had fun.; If I could put no, stars I would! Wal-Mart is getting ridiculous! All I wanted to get were new package of socks and they treat you like your a flipping thief!
Having to wait at the locked glass case for someone to unlock the case then being escorted to the front with the sales associate scanning the product for me.
Really need to find another place to get socks where hopefully they don't treat you like a thief...; This place changes there policies daily. Was not allowed in with a clear small backpack. As other customers roamed freely about the store with backpacks.
Also women with large handbags are allowed??
I'll never shop Walmart again...ever; I am giving a 5 star review based solely on my experience yesterday with the most amazing customer service by Kaden. She was so helpful and went above and beyond to help me after another employee failed to help. After she helped me, I also witnessed her helping another woman.

Lately a very grumpy, very rude and despotic woman has been working here. Today was the last straw for her mistreatment towards me, her name is Ann, at least that was the name she gave me, since she did not have a name tag on her. I decided to write this review, since I was not the only person who was disrespected with her arrogance, behind me there was another lady and a gentleman, who were also mistreated by Ann and the gentleman made the comment to me that the person serving was behaving very badly. Fortunately there was another lady serving who was very helpful and kind, who helped me to find another store that had my prescription available. Unfortunately I will have to change my prescriptions to another pharmacy, since I do not want to ruin my day by having to deal Ann
her excuse was that she is new to the store,  but that is not true since I have mentioned before,  today is not the first time she treats me with disrespect. I hope that someone gets on her attention before she keeps mistreating other customers.; Store seems clean and most of the staff is fairly friendly, have not used the pharmacy as of yet. Western Union is very quick and easy. The only strange thing is they have so many products under lock and key, even the body washes, have to admit, first time I've seen body wash for sale in a locked glass case. But if your item is locked away, they do have little buzzers by locked items so you don't have to go track someone down to help, which is nice. Could work on customer service at the front end as far as friendly customer engagement, parking lot a little narrow in places, but not a bad location. Will return if need be.; It may be a small store but full of extra values like better service , better attitude from employees and pharmacy area the best, personable.  Management always helpful beyond just nice.; Good customer service, nice environment. Just wish there will be music. Seems kind of mellow and depressing although the customer service was good and friendly. It doesn’t match the Aura of the store; I went in today I love love this store ! My favorite store near me but today I had the worst experience ever with the cashier ! Native looking girl didn’t know how to show respect nor talk to a customer the right way !

It's super convenient and my order sometimes simple other orders are all over the place BUT my orders are always 100% perfect.; Well I was in search for some particular bicycle parts. I hadn't been in the store for at least 5 years and had forgotten how huge it was. I'm pretty sure they have just about anything you could imagine.
Anyway, Lenny a very tall ""Greeter"" at the entrance was informative and very helpful. Knew exactly where to send me but it was almost two blocks away, LOL.

Only thing that I didn't like was when I got to the section with my bike parts they were in a locked case. A very nice black girl had the key but between her accent and not knowing about various parts or questions I had it became a bit awkward.
She was standing between me and the case so I had to hand her the parts back and forth until I could figure out which ones were the right size for what I was looking for. She was very nice and I think she just didn't realize being between me and the merchandise was just making things more time-consuming.
Unfortunately that's the price we pay in today's society for all the people that don't feel they need to pay for anything.
Everything worked out well in the end and I give the store a thumbs up 👍.

Public bathrooms were available and handicapped accessible. Could have been a little cleaner but it was near closing time. Also a huge free parking lot surrounding the store which is all located on the first floor, everything handicapped accessible.; I was shopping for a few cleaning products. Found them quickly when to pay up front lines everywhere, so I decided to go to electronics to check out. The associate working electronics was very rude, but I thought to myself. Okay, everybody has a bad day. Let it go paid for my things when exiting the store on the grocery side. I should have gone around. Instead, I went through the entrance gates. I worked a 12-hour shift at work and was extremely tired. I push through the gate and apologize to the door greater, and before I could say anything, he started to curse me out. I never cursed at him at all. I admitted that I was in the wrong and apologized for it. I asked my friend if I was rude, and he said I was just extremely, but no. I was not rude at all. People make mistakes, and it takes a human being to admit they are wrong. I did not deserve to be treated that way, and the store really needs to look at their door greater more often and how to talk to people. Every time I go to this store, the associates are very unhappy and look and talk like they want to quit. If people are that unhappy at their job, then why go. This is the worst Walmart store in Phoenix, and I will not be going back. I will drive 50 miles to avoid this store. I will be calling the corporate office in the morning about how this stores associates are unhappy that they are driving my business and the people I know away. Still has not changed. Employees are rude and very unhappy.; Salem keep some of the items in stock. I also went to buy a Bic lighter from the and they told me I could not get it because they were building a gas station what does a lighter have to do with a gas station? There's nothing torn up in the parking lot to make a gas station. I have lighters galore and they're not selling it which doesn't make sense. They should continue to sell the item in the store until that gas station is made.; At Car dept
This girl employee looks like 80’s style is low functional for real!!!!!
She won’t give me the item febreze car smell because it’s come from box locked. She wants me to pay right way. Cleaning dept have same products and no locked box. What is different!!!???

Super quick and easy. Plus you get extra discounts using the app. Love it!; Sams app for tire center needs to be updated. It will let you choose different sizes that they don’t fit even if I select search by vehicle and select manufacturer tire size. I placed an order that took a week to arrive to the store and got a call saying that the tire size will not fit, no problem ! Re-order using the app with search by tire size based on manufacturer manual, took another week to get the tires and after they arrived they call me saying that those tires will not work because they will wear at high rotation or something, really!. finally the gentleman proceeded with setting up an appointment to get the tires mounted. After couple of days my appointment was at 11am so I send out my wife with a simple task just drop of the car to get the tires replaced, well they took more than 4hrs to find out that first they skipped her to get another vehicle repaired and not only that they damaged some of my wheel bolts so they couldn’t replace my tires and send my wife no to buy 1 wheel bolts but 15 !  My wife doesn’t speak English so it was difficult for her to communicate she decided to call me explaining what was going on so we call out the manager Isidro to help her he with high respect and professionalism got to an agreement that he will reimburse 50% of the money for the wheel bolts so they send out  my wife to get them in the same vehicle that they  damage the wheel bolts after a few hours later since it was to hard to get 15 pieces in a single store (they aren’t cheap almost $10 each).my wife came back to tire center they told here that they were already working with vehicle in the dock and that all of them had already removed the tires( which was a lie) so we decided to call out Isidro but he already was off and call out manager Gabriel I try to explain the situation obviously by cellphone and this is what he told me: it is unprofessional to talk to you on the phone and having your wife just walking from one side to the other and not possible to communicate with her, what is that supposed to mean?! Gabriel may need to get a training how to manage and control to resolve different situations like Isidro did. Well my wife and I had enough and decided to go back home it was a long day for her and a disappointment, I end up canceling the service. Took it to Big O Tires. I’m a member+ by the way.

Understaffed or not they definitely need better training.; I initially visited the store to have a flat tire repaired, a service I have previously received without issue as a Sam's Club member. Upon arrival, I was promptly checked in by Arthur, and everything seemed to be in order. However, when I returned to the store, Doug became my point of contact, and my experience took a turn for the worse.

Doug incorrectly asserted that I had not purchased my tires from Sam's Club and questioned my membership status, despite Arthur having checked me in without any problems. Doug further claimed that the store’s physical computers, running on an outdated Windows 95 operating system, could not locate my record, even though the iPad system showed my information without issue. His tone and demeanor were unprofessional and dismissive, suggesting that the fault lay with the system rather than providing a solution.

As a customer, I should not be burdened with internal system issues. Doug's inability to assist me with my flat tire repair on the same day, coupled with his suggestion that it would take three days to complete the service, was unacceptable. Frustrated, I contacted another Sam's Club location at 83rd Ave and Union Hills, where I received prompt and efficient service on the same day.

This experience has been disappointing and has led me to question the quality of service at the 8340 W McDowell Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85037 location. Doug's lack of customer service skills and unwillingness to assist me is concerning, and I hope this issue will be addressed to prevent similar experiences for other customers.; Like other low reviewers stated, unless you are using pay and go, avoid this store. Customer service is so poor. Including “supervisor “ Raeven who has the nastiest attitude. Everyone acts like they’re doing you a favor by doing their job. My husband also had a negative experience.

There were literally 60 people in line and 20% of your self checkouts are reserved. You realize this just slows down the entire line, including the Spark Drivers as they are also waiting in the same line. This is helping no one and inconveniencing everyone. Let’s have a little common sense.

And not only that, but you have an obvious backlog and make no accommodation to have any cashier lanes open.

And screw you with your 10pm COVID closing hours. It’s 2024. Also, your cart return racks are all over the damn place and I almost hit one as it was sticking 3ft into the next parking space.; Went to get a fan, and some food .there was only 1 left of WindMachine, so I got it home. Took it out of the box, and it's Flippin broken. It looks as if someone cut off the plastic of the surrounding cage of the blades. It sucks that I can't get to the store to exchange it until possibly Thursday 😕; This place is always very busy. To avoid crowds one should avoid weekend trips or late afternoons and evenings.

They don't always enforce the 15 items or less in the self checkout, and frequently you'll see several checkout areas down for repairs, which can lead to long waits in lines that can get pretty deep.

I use this place basically because their Pharmacy hasn't let me down like Fry's often has. I do have to remind the Pharmacy on the app weeks in advance. The automatic refill hasn't always been reliable, but the staff has been superb at helping me sort out the details to receive my prescription at another location.

I do believe that the staff does the best job they can under the circumstances, and what more can you ask for?; I've lived in this area for a while now. (Been in the greater PHX area for going on 30 years). This is the worst Walmart. I don't like doing negative reviews, but I was here yesterday to pick up a gift and a gift card on the way to a hospital to see a friend. Parking is always a hazard at this Walmart, and once I had what I needed, the lines for the self checkout were backed into the aisles 20+ people. Since I had a giftcard, I wanted to make sure it got loaded so I went to the regular cashier checkout lines which had 10+ people with carts packed full. The lady ahead of me told me the person in the jewelry department was helping people with small amounts of items. I thanked her and went to the jewelry department. I stood behind 2 people and waited 5 minutes for one man to complete his purchase, then another man quickly purchased his drinks. Then the staff switched out and an employee sent the cashier to open another register I believe and I finally completed my purchase. After that, I tried to get out but because the lines were so outrageously long, and I was weaving between people, I ended up on the wrong side of the enter/exit rails and had to ask a staff to open it for me. I asked the staff if they needed to check my receipt but they kind of blew me off, which makes sense since I had one bag I guess.

I will not be returning to that Walmart....; If I could give -5 I would.

Didn't know what was wrong.  She asked me to check her car,  it had oil coming out of the hood and she noticed it was leaking oil from bottom.  I opened hood.

They didn't put the oil cap back on.

She could have cracked her engine, or caught on fire in 116 degree weather.

I bought oil and a cap and took it back.  The first manager was not going to help,  the next one gave her a new oil change,  tried to clean up the mess.

Just beware. This place is questionable.; Takes too much time getting an item that is in a locked case.
This has happened more than once. One time it took at least 4 employees to get help with getting the item we needed. We kept getting the ""runaround"".  I finally went to the Service Desk and got some help. I understand the merchandise being locked up.
I don't understand why it takes so long to get help.
My granddaughter has been paying a higher price for baby formula elsewhere because she doesn't want to go through the time consuming hassle of getting the formula from the locked case.; Overall, pretty good. They let me exchange an item which I had purchased the wrong color and brand of without any hassle or extra runaround or hoops to jump through. But, a heads-up: Sunday evening is a HORRIBLE time to go!!! Many popular items are out of stock, and other shoppers bring their entire extended families and seem to just be wandering aimlessly, parking their carts in the middle of the aisles with their screaming kids inside as they browse shelves 50 feet away, completely oblivious to the fact that some other shoppers are just trying to get in and out as fast as possible. In the future, I'll be shopping at like 11am on a Tuesday!!! Hopefully the customer base will be smaller and a bit more aware of their surroundings at that time!!! Lol!; This is a fairly typical location.  I have been here on various days at random times over the past couple of weeks.  This store seems to have more people stocking shelves with carts in the middle of the aisle than other places.  It also takes longer to check out, even when compared to other Walmart stores.  The store is clean and the shelves are mostly stocked.  The staff is friendly.  I would recommend trying another location or brand if time is important to you.  I've been in line for a very long time and have a ways to go.; if i could give this store 0 stars i would. the people who fill delivery orders are quite lazy. nobody ever picks up the phone when you try to contact them and even when they do they are unhelpful and completely rude. Legit had a delivery order with declined items and come to find out those items were in the store and the person filling my order did not want to do their job."

We like it as stocked up....
My.
Apologies hope it didn't add yet. I tried to get honest review. Still honest review. They're always stocked up. Their prices are reasonable and their staff is friendly. I don't ever have any problems. The only thing I can't do is operate a vehicle.  So my boyfriend, who is the driver usually weights in the car as I shop.He tells me what he wants usually.. And I get it for him. I never tried their pharmacy yet. Because I have something called optimum care. But if I get rid of often here I think I will use Walmart pharmacy. I do have a friend of mine that uses A.  A Her local pharmacy Walmart pharmacy.Sorry, but she's in a different state.She likes her Walmart.I know pharmacy.I personally never used And and they have a delivery service that was not half bad.Am sometimes they screw up or forget stuff but you know they're human tooo As for the story itself, always very clean.
N y never have any problems not usually their workers are quite nice
I have never had a bad experience as of Yet Walking around shopping at walmart not once; I think the store is set up strangely. It doesn't flow. But they do have some great clearance items I've noticed. And the employee's have always been very nice. Good vibes.; a place for all your shopping needs. a super cheap 85'' tv and snacks anyone?; 15 items or less at all self checkouts now.. They have one actual cashier.. End up waiting in line longer then it took to drive here and shop.
Then they check your receipt before you leave. YOU WONT LET ME CHECK MYSELF OUT WHY ARE YOU CHECKING MY RECEIPT."

It has a different layout, so I was lost the entire time. I had someone go get Undergarments & the associate took them to the register of her choice. While we were waiting at a different one for him to come back with them. We explained the situation to our cashier & she went to get them, but the first associate had a really bad attitude as if we were going to steal them. Our purchase was well over $200. We weren't going to steal $30 underwear. Everything else was nice.; Not a bad store for groceries and other shopping. But if you need help in any department you are in for a wait! The employees who carry the keys and are able to help have to cover multiple departments by themselves! Too much! It's even more hectic checking out now. Half the self checkouts are for members only and you have to pay for the privilege. Kinda messed up if you ask me!; The actual local store has amazing employees however the drivers that deliver for this store are horrible! They lie about delivering items and steal them, don't complete their jobs and delivery because of laziness understanding English and last follow instructions on delivering the items ordered! Please don't get Angel the delivery driver; This location is pretty small for a supercenter. The parking lot is small as well. It's a basic walmart, better at times to go at different times of the day. I went an early morning during the week and it was peaceful and not crowded but what I dislike is how certain things are locked up and you have to have an associate bring it up to self checkout. It's sad how we as grown people can't behave because it resorts to low trust. And with low trust, comes low patience and it makes someone not even want to shop here. I get the reasoning behind it but it's still unfortunate.; First best funny shopping experience ever. Enjoyed shopping with electronic cart 🛒 and survey every sections for this supermarket.

This branch area is not that big but various choices to select for all categories. Bread and bakery smells so nice. Crowed with normal people which a bit disappointed. Tourists and foreigner spotted which understandable what are they come here and looking for.

Most price tag is super cheap.

Special thanks to friendly staffs who keep my purchased stuffs that I forgot for me and don’t mind and we joked about it. The lady who supported to guide the way for me. The young boy who keep an eyes on emergency exit door. So many dumb people including me tried to walkthrough but he didn’t show any sign of annoying but polite to guide to everyone where is the right direction.

So many parking area.  ATM is available inside same as lotto.

PNC ATM is located outside Walmart but around parking area.

Some customers may smelly so beware.

In general, overall is pretty normal,cheap and ofc quality and grade also depends on price as well.

Will visit again to see 👀 rare items"

I was trying to print very special pictures from my son's firefighter Family Night and was having problems. The photo person redid my botched photos at no cost. I have a CVS closer to me and their customer service is horrible. I'll stick to my Walgreens.; Waited over 20 minutes before the pharmacy tech came to the window, then rudely asked “Can I help you??” and had an attitude over having to help a customer. Just changed to CVS 👎🏼; Whoever is handling the pharmacy on holidays like 7/3 need to be a heck of a lot friendlier. We all understand it’s a holiday and y’all probably don’t want to work, but there no reason for the absolute mess and level of rudeness this am was. The first person, young lady hung up on me, second person looked like they’d rather kill themselves then help customers. Really miss the normal staff and if it wasn’t for them I’d be moving all of my prescription; Clearly someone works here that shouldn’t. Incredibly rude, been waiting for 5 days to get prescription in, and when asked about how long, clearly it was too much for her to say. “We’re really backed up and sorry delay”
Rather, a snide remark to how many people in front and clearly zero compassion. You’re in health care whether you like it or not. Care being key word. Dissapointed, and after this, never coming back; My doctor sent a prescription in for strep throat.

Pharmacist and tech were incredibly rude. Refused to give me an estimated pick up time. I obviously didn’t feel well and the customer service/compassion were absolutely horrific

Would rather cash pay to go to another pharmacy"

He was polite the entire time and was patient while we went to get our car. The entire experience was amazing customer service, and I would definitely ask for his help at this Walmart again!!; Worst experience since covid. Nonsensical “store policy” now doesn’t allow customers to exit through automotive side door even if you’re parked in automotive parking lot which is utterly obnoxious, ridiculous and very unsafe in an emergency. Was made to walk all the way around the front exits in 110+ degree heat since garden center exit is also permanently closed just because some idiot decided to not allow customers to use certain exits. If I’m buying things at a store I am allowed to use any public exit available. Whoever is responsible should be held accountable to the highest degree. Will NOT be shopping at this place any more.; Had an appointment for a oil change car was driving fine when I went in 15 min after I pull out my brakes are scrubbing. Come on now ridiculous brakes don't go go from being ok to scrubbing bad that fast it's a progression.; I really like this location it's a little nicer they recently did the remodel so it's a lot more better looking than some of the other locations in the surrounding area. The staff is relatively friendly and it has to be a cleaner store than other Walmart said I go to. I suggest going early to shop for your goods because the afternoons and evenings get really busy. I don't see a lot of riff Raff in there like I do at other surrounding locations. I highly recommend this Walmart.; This is not the place where you want to order curbside pickup. Last time we ordered a pool for our kids and it said pick up available at 11am. We get there and it said out of stock. I get off the car to confirm and they had 3 pools on the aisle. This time we order regular size products but they end up putting everything in travel size and still charged us. Idk if the curbside employees are lacking or their lead is. They need to pick up the phase and straighten up. Hope they give people their correct stuff because so far it looks like they don’t. The other thing if something is heavy ask for help instead of being lazy. Sometimes people really need what they are buying!!"

Such a rude little attitude. My stomach turns every time I have to see her. Please give her customer service training. She needs to not have the huge chip on her shoulder every day at that register. She hates being there! She is rude to everyone! This is the 3rd complaint I've made on her. I have one customer I get medications there that won't change pharmacies. Go someplace else!; The little guy manager that works in the mornings is such a loser it’s weird. I don’t know his name & can’t tell you his ethnicity but he could be mid eastern or some type of latin-ish idk. But the dude has some extreme insecurities & I’ve never even spoke to the dude, yet he always accuses me of “stealing” which is weird because he only accuses me when I’m literally at the register? Literally at the register, trying to purchase items…and I go to that drug store almost every single day & literally spend hundreds of dollars there regularly. I’m guessing he may be just judging me by the way I look? Or there is something about me that makes him uncomfortable or insecure or something. I know pretty much all of the employees there & i was a regular customer. I just personally don’t like the guy, even before he accused me of stealing, I just got a really slimy vibe from him..just from over hearing him crack corny jokes with the employees & just his disposition in general I can just tell he is insecure about something, but I’ve never disrespected him. His voice is very high pitched & it sounds like he may be impotent & small-balled. Because he only has the balls to accuse me of stealing when I’m literally purchasing items at the register, when there is an audience. I think that may just be his little moment of glory so he can feel like a hero in front of the lil dum dum cashier girl, nothing against her, she’s just a little slow. But not as slow as harassing & accusing a regular customer who spends hundreds at your store. Literally no proof, I’m literally spending money at the register, but that’s his big opportunity to show the little girls he’s a hero despite the size of his….manhood. Not a bright guy. If I were “stealing” anything, why the heck would I go to the register & literally purchase things? Sometimes HUNDREDS of dollars!! I just can’t handle little dudes like him. He didn’t like the way I look or something & used me as an opportunity to show off for the dum dum girl. Like come on guy..you’re a manager at WALGREENS 🙄 do you get paid extra to accuse regulars of stealing? What did you gain? Im pretty sure the dum dum girl still isn’t attracted to you. I get that your job is bleak & that’s the most excitement you get on your little shift, but dude, your voice still sounds like a woman & you still spend your life working in a drug store. Bothering regular customers who spend money at your store isn’t impressive & will never change the fact that your job is bleak & you’re insecure. Did you get a raise? Did the dumdum girl seem impressed? Doubt it. You’re still bleak little man spending your days in a bleak little store. Good job though, you lost a customer just for your cute little moment of glory so you could feel like one of the big boys with testosterone. Put some bass in your damn voice next time you try to pretend you’re Superman. I literally thought you were a woman when I heard you. Congrats. Try to stretch that little moment of glory as long as you can..it’s basically the biggest hallmark of your life.; 1/5 stars specifically for the Pharmacy. I’ve been going to this Walgreens to pickup my prescriptions for over 2 years and never had a bad experience until about 5 months ago. Now every time I call I’m getting BAD ATTITUDE & SASS, and complete lies about there being issues with my prescriptions. If you don’t like your job then quit, don’t get every single person a HEADACHE when we are trying to fill our prescriptions at a PHARMACY! I’ve heard “insurance issue, didn’t receive your refill from doctor, no pre-authorization” and XYZ - then I ask HER again and she’s like ok it will be ready this afternoon with SUCH SASS & ATTITUDE - like are you MAD that I’m prescribed drugs lady????!!! Do you NOT want me to refill my prescriptions???? IM CONFUSED!??!?!? From now on I’m avoiding this pharmacy at all cost & the last straw for me was when I just called she said I needed a refill from my doctor I asked her to look again because that didn’t make sense I get hung up, I call back and a guy answers and RIGHT AWAY finds my prescription says there is no problem and come pick it up. WHAT THE HECK!??!? She needs to be fired because she clearly is finding joy in making paying customers practically beg her to refill there subscribed prescriptions!?!??; Kathryn is a awesome chick,she went out her way to get pizza I wanted that they had out of stock in the fridge..I even told her it wasn't a big deal however she found the Pizza anyhow🤌🫴pizza is life; This is to my fellow folks working at this Walgreens pharmacy.

I don't shop anywhere else for my cocktails and beverages.; When I visited the staff were very professional and courteous. I was looking for some beer from a specific brewery that they do not carry but none the less professional. They did have a ton of whiskey, bourbon, and rye that I've been looking for, so definitely a positive place for me to go back to. The only reason for a 4 star is because it's a much smaller store than I am used to. So until next time, stay cool, AZ.; Like all total wine locations the store is well kept and clean. The selection of drinks is second to none and the prices are very fair. I'm glad that they have a wide selection of gluten free beers as well that you can't find anywhere else.; *****Its  amazing to me how these clowns.......don't actually read these reviews.

Pleasant and consistent disposition with the 2 consumers I observed that were helped prior to my interaction with Loren.

I did not have time to interface with a manager to point blank ask why, but I was support very kindly by Loren. Again, consistently kind, helpful, and a delightful personality. Honestly, Loren was a gem, so, although, I had to venture in to get my fairly large order it was okay. I was unhappy, though, as the mystery continues, ""why does Target continue to give consumers expired meats in their orders?"" I have had it happen at another Target as well.

The store has been doing some updates on the merchandising lately. I only wish that the outside were clean and paid attention to.

The store is backed up and they closed customer service early. I called customer care and they can not override the stores decision. I was advocating for myself and an elderly gentleman who had been waiting longer than me. The team lead, Rebecca, stated that she couldn’t help us. No consideration shown for our time or gas to get there. It would have taken 5 minutes to process my return and help that gentleman. I am only stating her name in case corporate needs to interview her about what was happening. This situation was really shameful in my opinion. Poor organization, poor decision making and horrible customer service. I will not come to this location again. I will more than likely use Amazon for all my future purchases because an this in store experience was beyond horrible and unnecessary. Customer Service closes normally at 8pm. I arrived a little before 7pm and the man had been waiting 15 minutes already. We are paying customers like anyone else. The overriding message is that purchases take priority over returns. I am honestly floored that this happened. Its not like they had an emergency situation or medical crisis happening. If you must go to Wal-Mart, I suggest you try another one.; Amazing employees here. From those that collect the carts, the door greeters to those working at customer service.
The MG that hired these people is on the ball.
Trinity at customer service went above and beyond.
I even went online and filled out the info on the walmart.com site about how wonderful Trinity is.
She handled each customer with care. She was calm with the nasty ones.
She definitely deserves something for this. Not many places have good employees like her.
Everyone I encountered was great.
Too bad we can't tip them. It's sad. Those who deserve a tip can't get one. Those that do nothing and are horrible at stores and restaurants deman tips. I wish I could have given Trinity a tip.; Hey everyone! I was pleasantly greeted by a wonderful employee named CJ. She was doing her job amazingly and made me feel welcomed in this wonderful store. She made me feel good and I can't wait to shop here now just because of how sweet she is.; ve done order pickup from this store three times, and EVERY SINGLE TIME it’s been an absolute disaster. I’m done. Waiting 20-60 minutes for an order is beyond unacceptable. People were literally getting out of their cars and walking to the door after being stuck for 45 minutes. Are you serious? Wasting people’s time and gas like that is disgraceful. And to make matters worse, when you finally get your order, the staff acts like it’s a burden to them—as if it’s my fault they can’t get it together. This Walmart is more interested in harassing customers for their receipts than actually running a functional pickup system. Stop policing people at the door and put more staff on pickup so this doesn’t keep happening. Fix this disaster.; Attempted to take my son to the dressing room, as he has hit a growth spurt and needed to buy him new pants that actually fit. While there, between 5-6 PM yesterday, an older associate who was folding clothes in the fitting room said they were closed for the day since there were no employees to work the fitting rooms. The employee confirmed she was working the fitting rooms, but was by herself(it is a one person position). Whether she legitimately couldn’t open the fitting room, or was being lazy, it appeared as if she did not care. She brushed us off, and her tone in response was filled with disgust that she had to talk to a customer. Let me be clear, this review is being written for the one single elderly employee who felt customers were beneath her. Otherwise, the store would have gotten 5 stars. Not in the mood to spend my money when the Karen treats me like I am less than her or bothering her, by asking to use a fitting room."

I also wish the pharmacy stayed open until 8pm on Saturday. During the work week it might be difficult for some to get to the pharmacy and hold off on picking up prescriptions until the weekend. Making it to the pharmacy by 6pm is sometimes not feasible after carpooling kids around all day on Saturday. There's just a comfort know you have until 8pm to pick up your meds.; I’ve had times that I get a voice mail telling me my prescription is ready and when I get there it is not ready. TODAY 6-8-24 I received a courtesy call from a real person, I think she said Veronica but I’m not sure, anyway she said my prescription was ready and it would be put back in the shelf if I didn’t pick it up by tomorrow. I told her I’d be there today. I went about 1/2 hr later and they said they were waiting for my Dr. approval. They didn’t even apologize, they acted like I made up the “ courtesy call”.; If you’re looking for a pharmacy that runs smoothly and has customer service, this is NOT the one.

Prefacing this by stating I’ll still be using this spot since it is right next to my house. BUT! The pharmacy seems clueless at times, and if not clueless then completely rude! I call to refill, they place me on hold 4x (10-15minutes) just to answer finally with an unwarranted attitude. This is almost every time.

Please get some people back there who know how to treat a customer or retrain ur current workers. I don’t write bad reviews unless it really stands out, and the lady today stood out.; Seriously the worst pharmacy customer service. I called yesterday for my prescription to be ready today and when I show up to get them they have no record of my call or my prescription. I let them know it was urgent and they still wouldn’t be ready for an hour and a half. This also happened last month and I thought it may have been a fluke but seem like a pattern now. Get it together.; Most serious problem: they printed SOMEONE ELSE'S LABEL on MY prescription bottle. Luckily, I received the right drug, and since I looked at the receipt but NOT the bottle (drugs looked like they always did), I didn't notice right away. So I received someone else's prescription info, including their name, their drug info, and their address. A CLEAR HIPPA violation.

The pharmacy dept. didn't seem too upset when we pointed it out, just muttered that they'd been having problems with the label printing for a while (for ""a while""!).

More recently, checked in for a vaccine, using the QR code posted at the pharmacy, 30 minutes after check-in (25 min after appointment time), was told not to use the QR code, becase ""the app doesn't work very well - you should just come up to the counter."" Still took 15 more minutes to get called in for the vaccine (30 min after appointment time, with NO OTHER CUSTOMERS WAITING).

They are apparently chronically understaffed. YOU CAN'T RUN A BUSINESS THIS WAY!"

There's a new guy in meat/produce who I found out is autistic and the coach in that department was being incredibly rude to him. Making him feel he can't do anything right when he just started there. Made him upset and almost starting crying!! They pick their favorite associates and go with the flow without a care in the world.

My son and I just visited this store, and he was so excited about all the Halloween decorations. Even the registers were decorated! They are always clean and organized, and the staff is the friendliest Walmart staff I've ever experience. I come out of my way to go to this Walmart instead of the one closer to my house. Thanks and keep it up!; So I was in the 6 pm on 9/27/24
There was a guy in need of assistance. He definitely needed some help to find a 2025 calendar. I don't like to assume but he had some special needs. I seen a guy Manger blow him off and say  look I am supposed to be getting off right now. Then he walked away. He told a different person. This lady should definitely not be working in customer service. She had a nasty attitude to this gentleman. It was a major inconvenience for her to help. He told her what he was looking for and she pointed its that way.He asked for her to take him over to the calendars. The guy was obviously struggling to even talk. She acted like my teenager rolled her eyes and demanded a different person take him. Definitely unprofessional and a miserable person inside. Do better walmart 🙄  why have people that don't do there jobs working for you. If your workers can't be nice fire them. I could understand if this guy was rude. But he wasn't. Make the door the mangmet! He is awesome!!!; Walking in looking for latex gloves passing by the new Halloween candy I see two lady's putting it up and I ask where i can find latex gloves and as the younger lady starts to look it up the older lady's interrupted  and said there in pharmacy if we have them so I go and look all over the little area and don't see any so I took it into my own hands and found that they are in fact not in pharmacy but isle I6 I found that older lady super unhelpful and rude and she should probably be re trained on wear things are and how to speak to a customer; The self checkout people were not nice. They told us we suppose scan and go in a different place. We didn't know there was a specific self check out. We did apologize and they didn't. The lady was mad and frustrated that she was having problems with so called upfront. What's the point to have self checkout with scan and go if we can't go to a self scan that suppose to be like that. I swear. I'm never a person who would give bad reviews but really today.; Just bought two bags of Mr Rainier cherries (total cost $16.86 + tax), taking care to look carefully for rotten cherries.  I already had to put four bags aside because I found rotten ones in them, and thought the two I bought looked ok.  Went home and washed them, only to find 25 rotten ones - one not pictured because it was so bad, I had to throw it away!

I take care of my Mom at home, so I can't just drive back the same day and wait through customer service to get my money back.

I've included a photo.  I hope Walmart strive to offer better quality in the future!"

I had to get medication to make sure I didn’t miscarry my unborn child. When I spoke with the pharmacist and they said they didn’t have it and couldn’t get the medication until two days later. I informed them I need this medication, my doctors office needs me on it today to prevent a miscarriage. Can they see if another location has it in stock. That I could drive as far as I needed to, to get this medication. She came back about five minutes later and said they can fill it today. I asked if they are sure and they said yes. Came back later, no medicine I was told the next day. It was too late to transfer to another pharmacy. Came back the next day and they said they don’t have it and that there pharmacy said it’s not supposed to be filled for five days. I told them I needed it to not miscarry my baby can they please transfer the prescription to another Walgreens. They refused saying they could fill it. This went on for five days. Five days they refused to let me move the prescription to another pharmacy and five days in a row they kept telling me they can fill it. My husband went down and ended up in an argument with the head pharmacist about the urgency of it. Not even an hour after the argument they had my prescription filled. My doctors office, my OBGYN, when he heard what happened he was very angry at this pharmacy. He said this is the most unprofessional, lazy pharmacy and there was no reason for them to risk the life of my unborn child just so there location can get the money for the prescription. He recommended we change locations because it's not a pharmacy that cares about the people going to it, only the money.
This wasn't the first incident we've had with this pharmacy.
My husband is a type 1 diabetic with an insulin pump. Each pump has its own medical supplies specific to each tester and pump. He got a new updated pump. I had to argue with a pharmacist who believes she knew best  and changed his new lancets and test stripes to the old pump, ones that wouldn't work with his new one. she refused to listen saying ""he has this pump and tester"" and i kept telling her thats the old prescription, we need the new one not the old one. according to her its not an issue because he has his old tester. My husband had to go back after a 10 hour work day to argue with the head pharmacist why that wasn't okay and why he needs the new stuff. All the head pharmacist did was protect the person who wouldn't listen and refused to fill the new prescriptions. Eventually it got fixed after we threatened to sue them. it was the only reason they fixed it.; If there was a zero star the Walgreens pharmacy would be getting one they never answer the phone I've been on hold for over 30mins and still on hold currently. They don't even answer and say it'll be a moment instead they just keep putting you on hold. Customer service in the pharmacy department is horrible I would change pharmacies if I were you.; I refuse to go here because of the filth that loiters around the building. There is always at least a dozen homeless junkies sitting by the entrance, hanging near the back of the store, etc... you see them bent over on drugs, pan handling, loitering. Its way more than average in that area, and i believe its because walgreens refuses to kick them off the property. I cant my bring my children there, and honestly i dont even like to drive by walgreens because my kids always say something about all the people without shirts hanging around this place.; Literally worst pharmacy I have ever been to. Terrible. No one knows how to do their job and there’s something wrong with my prescriptions every. single. time. never fails. I will never be returning here after today!; I will never use this Walgreens Cave Creek Road in Union Hills pharmacy again. I spoke to the pharmacist this morning and he refused to fill my prescription. I have been using the pharmacy at Greenway and Cave Creek Road for close to 15 years. They were excellent. They are closing on February 20 and have moved everything over to the Pharmacy on Union Hills And Cave Creek Road. I can’t believe how bad the pharmacist is there. He made me feel absolutely humiliated about the medication I am taking. I felt so bad after talking to him. I can’t believe that a pharmacist is allowed to speak to a customer in this manner. I asked him to look at my Walgreens records from the other location. He refused to look at my records. And refused to fill the order that my doctor had called in. I will continue to reach out to everybody. I can to let them know about the pharmacist at this location, Cave Creek Road in Union Hills."

These guys are all very friendly and knowledgeable, have a great selection that is exactly where it should be, they’re not trying to get rich off every bottle they sell. I have wanted a bottle of Widow Jane Decadence for 2 years now and when I walked in it was sitting there and not marked way up, they even ordered a bottle that I’ve been looking for and called me when it arrived! Best store in the area in my opinion and I would drive there from Hartwell any time.; We went there on September 19th 2024 and the staff was very nice and helpful. The store was so big it took me a minute to take it all in. The prices were way better here and they had a lot of deals; Went in for the first time yesterday and man…. I have never experienced this level of customer service in a liquor store before. All 3 gentlemen at the counter were class acts and had some seriously good vibes.

If it weren't for them, I may not have kept as cool as I would've liked during my experience here.

Upon making a decision to purchase a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue, which was marked with a sticker directly on the bottle for $225, Shelley had kindly helped get the bottle from the case, and offered to cash me out. As the barcode would not scan, Shelley asked if it would be okay to manually enter the sticker price to ring me out.Before she could do so, a middle aged, unpleasant man ran over to the register to quickly scrape off the price sticker, while stating the bottle was $255. As I asked why he would do this, another elderly man behind the counter yelled ""its a small business"" and proceeded by making other rude illegible comments.

Jan must've seen what was happening, and came to assist Shelley with gift wrapping as they cashed me out.  Both were genuinely kind women and remained in the holiday spirit.

Small business or corporation, you should honor marked pricing on your inventory, and treat customers with a little respect and understanding.

I have several wine shops that I visit often because of the individuality of their selections. The French wines here are relatively good, and the Chinese premium liquor is also good. However, Linwood Wine's Linwood Plaza branch seems to be poorly managed. The prices are not accurate, and the attitude of the employees is very unfriendly. After the $41.99 wine was calculated as $85.49, and while looking into the problem, I found out that the price display was wrong. So I had no choice but to change it to a different wine. However it turned out that the other wine was also priced incorrectly. It was a chaos. The biggest problem was that when I told the store manager about the problem that there was no reliable price tag, I was even more surprised by the his attitude, saying that the customer did not understand the small mistake and got angry. If you visit this store, please always check the prices. I cannot recommend this store to those who want to buy wine with reasonable price tag. Watch out!; Great store!

In the store, on the shelves in the fresh vegetables department there are expired products, such as packaged carrots 7/5/24 today is 7/25. Asparagus price 3.99 it’s not clear what LB or bunch is for, I paid $9 because they sold it to me by weight, everywhere it is sold as a bunch, no one answered my question in customer service, my proposal was to fix it on the shelf so as not to enter  people were misled, they told me they would correct it, but 2 days have passed, and the price is the same and not clear for LB or Bunch.  A whole watermelon costs $5.99 but if I want a quarter I have to pay 1.69 a pound and pay $6 for a quarter just because they cut it, it's kind of a rip off.   The store management simply does not control anything, it’s a shame; Cashiers are outright horrible. The deli department is slow and constantly runs out of product, especially sale items. Whomever is training the staff needs to take a refresher course. (See photo) They claim that there are no substitutions because the manager is not available. They seem to wait until almost something in every aisle needs restocking. They seem not to be able to control theft. Their solution is to treat everyone as a criminal. I finally got tired of waiting for improvement, especially the deli department. They consistently run out of product, and due to shortage in staff, the complete disarray of the department, and the failure of fulfilling application orders, I have switched to the Aberdeen Shoprite. They have product and a full and friendly service.; Brianna ( my apologies if I’m spelling your name wrong) This female has been helpful every single time I had a question . When she worked in floral helpful with any questions with product. Then I see her in self checkout always a help never a frown always a beautiful smile . I continue to go to this ShopRite because people like Brianna .; We ordered catering from their app. It was easy,paid online, and chose our own date and time for pick up.
Everyone enjoyed the food for my son's birthday and said it tasted great.
Will order again for our next event.

We ordered the penne vodka, chicken Parmigian, baked ziti, sausage and peppers, mediterranean salad, and rainbow fruit platter.; When u ask at the appy department for things to be sliced thin they show you the first slice but when u get home the product is cut a lot thicker then they show you is just ridiculous is it laziness or they don't care but complaining to the store or to the corporate office nothing gets done where to get cold cuts that are cut to the way you would like them is the end question"

I used to late evening shifts. Its amazing to see the transformation after almost 23 years! For a minute, I thought this was whole foods!
Its very well organized, good quality produce and prepared meals, empanadas!; This is a very nice Kroger. It is clean and has a lot of featured sections, butcher, bakery, cheese shop, sushi, and hot food items. They even have a KroBar!! Which is a great way to have a pint or glass of wine as you shop. I have seen this in other Krogers, but to have this right on the beltline is awesome. The store also has a Starbucks. Fantastic parking and security as well.; I had a horrible incident at the Kroger on Ponce that has the bar facing the Atlanta Beltline. I asked the lady cooking outside on the patio if she could turn down the music as it was so loud people where covering there ears, except for a few illegal vendors that were selling next to this employee of Kroger. I spoke to the manager about the volume of the music. The woman cooking outside of this Kroger, who had a small beard, was an embarrassment to both Kroger and humanity in general. Another customer witnessed this Kroger employee screaming and yelling when asked to turn down the music. Even an employee suggested lowering the volume. I thought speaking with the manager would resolve the situation, especially since other employees had witnessed her acting so inappropriately. However, when the manager, an older Indian woman, came out, she said there was nothing she could do as Kroger had authorized it and suggested coming inside as a solution. To make matters worse, inappropriate ads—clearly from a Pandora stream—were playing, and the music was completely unsuitable for children of any age. It’s disappointing to see Kroger being a bad neighbor to those within earshot of this terrible music.; Horrible serve. Ridiculously rude security allowing random stragglers into Kroger but we were rejected because they were “closed.” They were in fact not closed. When asked, she stated that they worked here. When asked, the customers did not work here. Accepting monetary offers to be let into the store “after hours” for alcohol.; Poor customer service in pickup! After checking in on the app, I had to flag an employee down to remind them I was there. The employee moved with no sense of urgency even though 5+ cars had also been waiting at least 45 minutes past their pickup window. The employee NEVER returned and no explanation was given. After calling corporate, only then was I able to be told that my order would be unable to be fulfilled until 10AM the next day. Kroger said they could only offer me $10 store credit for my next order. Why would I order again given this level of customer service? Unacceptable!"

She was rude and disrespectful and didn’t know anything about customer service. I’ve had this issue with the same girl at the same location before. I just had surgery and needed to get meds and wasn’t able to. I went hours in pain because I had to call my doctors office and have the prescription sent elsewhere since I got absolutely no help. I will never be going here again. Thanks for nothing.; I've come to this Walgreens for years to use the pharmacy, usually I can hang through the long waits because they're polite about it. Dealing with Marie today was enough to make me switch. Someone her age and in her position should know better than to slam the phone down, roll her eyes, and throw her hands in the air when someone is asking a question. Terrible customer service.; Worst pharmacy staff ever. Not worth one star. They have you waiting in line inside (and drive through) for 30 mins to an hour each time to be told that they don't have your meds in stock. Always the run around with this pharmacy.; Went in last night to pick up a prescription. Was told that there was in issue with my insurance and I needed to bring in a copy of it so I did. This is not a complaint about the pharmacist that helped me last night but he told me my insurance was expired and that he would leave a note for someone to call my insurance today. Waited this morning to hear back from the pharmacy only to call them and basically got complained at over the phone from the pharmacist today that “they don’t call insurance, I would have to call insurance.” He stated that to me multiple times after I told him someone told me they would call. I get it. I’m just reiterating what someone had told me so either take accountability or don’t but it’s not my fault. I’m just trying to get the meds I’ve been waited over three days for.; If I can do a negative feedback on this Walgreens location I would. I had an appointment today (05/15/22) with my 3 kids for covid test and this old lady with a glasses thought I was the only one so I told her there's 4 of us together and she started shaking her head and rolling her eyes told me she can't do it so I was like what do you mean you can't do it? I'm not gonna come back again and go through the line also I was telling her my wife works at the other Walgreens location she just put the down the phone down right away and doesnt wanna hear anything at all and still shaking her head and it's been 2 hours right now I still havent got our results and its clearly stated and she told me we will get our results within 2 hours. she's by far the rudest employee I've encountered in this Walgreens location. I will never going back again to this place."

I always have a great experience with in-store pickup or drive up. I have never had a problem with order accuracy. Sometimes I will come in the store to browse, but I prefer not to. There are not many open check out lanes when I go inside.; Great products my pick up orders are always done on time. When I come to pick up my orders I don’t wait long at all they bring it right out. I’ve always had good interactions with the employees as well. Always friendly and professional.; I went to target to get a pumpkin  to make pumpkin  pie from scratch  because  pumpkins are a vegetable in the produce  section.  Tried to use my food stamps  and I was denied  to buy that vegetable as it's not considered  a produce  vegetable like the other items in the vegetable  section.  I was able to buy everything  els with my food stamps.  I went to frys and got the pumpkin  with EBT food stamps instead as they consider  a pumpkin  a food item and produce.; This is my closest Target but I rarely go here. Nothing says we don't trust your customers than security dressed like they are in a war zone and many items are all locked up. Sorry, but if I have to go find someone every time I need something from a locked cabinet (which is becoming more & more items) then I will shop somewhere else or online. I like to browse and read packages for contents but now first I have to find someone to unlock a cabinet & then have them stand there and watch me read packages while I decide which one I want. I have literally walked in this store for something specific, saw it was locked up so I just left & went elsewhere where they don't assume every customer is a thief.; They have started playing a very creepy and loud 1984 style announcement in the parking lot about it being monitored.   I'm all for extra security, and they have tons of that here, but that recording in the parking lot is too much.  Big brother is watching you here.

The security guards are a bit over the top too and really give you the stare down when you walk in.  Will avoid this location in the future."

Most places don’t even offer a receipt and I’d have never known about the rebate offer without this store doing that.

I also enjoyed looking through the plentiful bourbon options as well as their discounted items cart.

Staff was very nice and really allowed me to take my time looking through everything.; Just stopped in and was AMAZED by their foreign selection. Picked up a New Zealand, Belgian, Italian, Japanese, and an Austrian! And it's not just foreign. Their Bourbon selection was TOP TIER! Spoke with the owner for quite a bit and she had a real passion for the spirits. I highly recommend stopping in if you're looking for rare and unique products! 10/10; Stopped off the Melrose, MN. exit for a quick bite and fuel stop. Found Spiritz Liquor.  If you like Bourbon this is a must see. Great selection and very reasonable pricing. Alyssa is a hoot and knowledgeable about all things Bourbon.

I've updated this because I like the store and I'm hoping the owner/manager will see it and take some corrective action.

While the selection is still good (for Mississippi), the staff has gone downhill. The one guy I see every visit acts like he just doesn't care, as if customers are an inconvenience. He has no conversational or sales skills and because of his attitude, I often shop elsewhere now. The only thing he said to my wife and me was the total of the sale and ""do you want a receipt?"" No one offers to lug a case to my car, no one says thank you, no one makes any recommendations, just ""no, we don't have that"".

Buying wine should be a pleasant experience. This particular employee is driving people - like me - away.

Previous review: ""Great wine store. Excellent selection. Knowledgeable staff.""; There were 2 liquor stores I could make it to on time after getting out of work late. unfortunately I chose this one that was closed at 9:50 when when I got there and didn’t have time to make it to the other one so no rum cake for the birthday boy. I’m sure he’ll understand that the liquor store clerk didn’t feel like doing his job.; The owner always has the wine I like. Big selection and good prices.
I always shop here!!; he owner wants to limit your ability as a consumer to buy from a wider selection of wine and liquor. He doesn’t want you to be able to buy wine and ship it to your home, and he doesn’t want you to buy it from your local grocer. Why? Because he only cares about protecting his business from competition.; Always a positive experience.   Very helpful.  Staff is knowledgeable and professional.  It doesn't matter if you are buying low end or high end, you are respected."

I spent about 3 minutes in the store and purchased a bottle of malbec. The manager or owner of the store was incredibly rude. She kept stating that the store was closing, not that they were closed. She acted as if she did not want my business. She should work on her customer service skills. She was incredibly rude.; Not impressed.  Bought a bottle of whiskey labeled $33.99 on the shelf.  They rung it up $44.99.  I said thats not the price on the shelf.  They went and looked and it said $33.99.  Then the lady said thats for the other size.  I said well all the bottles are above that label do you have the other size.  No.  No apologies.  It’s either intentionally deceptive price labeling or the people that work there just don’t care.  Either way, i’ll go elsewhere next time, maybe a big box store that can appropriately price products, and be sure not to support this local business."

YOU ARE MUCHLY APPRECIATED 🫶; Don’t buy their already made/frozen pizzas. Absolutely garbage. They advise to not put directly on the oven rack, so I used pizza pans. Took twice as long as they wrote in the instructions and still the bottom of the crust was complete dough. Falling apart off the pizza pan. Went right in the garabge. What a joke.; Discovered this place while searching for a particular beer that we just couldn't find anywhere in the GR area...hubby called and they had it. Mark held six 15 packs for us and was super helpful and friendly. When we arrived we understood why they had it, they've got EVERY type of beer, liquor, cordial, hard cider, seltzer you name it! And all the fixings to go with whatever your looking for. Very clean and well organized...highly recommend; The homemade pizza is the best in town.

I made photos of tomatoes with mold and rotten potatoes today, and the box of blueberries went right to trash can at home. I pointed spoiled vegetables to a girl working next to them but she couldn’t care less. Shame!!!!!; This Kroger is abysmal. First, you're greeted by zero shopping carts because why bother having those on a regular basis?

This was a very cozy and longstanding place for those nearby, and I hope you continue to do right by her :); We stopped at this store on our way to the UP after hearing about it back down in the Metro Detroit area.  It didn’t disappoint!  The store was built in the 1950s and Phil, the owner has managed to somehow keep some of the original features.

Inside you will find supplies for your bonfires, snacks, some grocery items, gifts, a walk in beer cooler, and an absolute BANGER of a liquor selection.   He’s got the well known go to’s and a great selection for those who want something different, or looking for something for a special occasion.

The owner is personable and I can tell he is thrilled to be a part of this community. The drive is scenic and I definitely recommend.; Came in on the first day of re-opening and had a nice conversation with the new owner, Phil. He's done a great job with the place and made us feel very welcome. It's amazing to have a place to grab supplies without leaving the paradise of the lake again!; Great store.

Very clean organized and as always Sam’s club did not disappoint as far as selection goes. Found what I was looking for and then some. I love the Scan and go option on their app. You simply scan your items as you add them to your cart and pay on your phone! Huge time saver!; Undercooked BLOODY rotisserie chicken. AGAIN. This is the 3rd time this year I got under-cooked chicken from the Glendale Sam's Club. Somebody is going to get sick if this keeps happening. It's very disgusting and dangerous to not properly cook chicken. Sam's Club needs to review their rotisserie standards as soon as possible. Sam's club has lots of elderly customers who can become very ill from salmonella poisoning.; Today I got to Sam's Bakery to pick up a cupcake order.  The team at the bakery couldn't find my order.   I pulled up the receipt and realized I made a huge mistake.  I placed the order for the incorrect location (near home instead of near work).  I didn't have time to drive to that one then back near work.  The woman at the bakery suggested the pre-made cupcakes out on the floor but they were not ideal for the baby shower I was supposed to be at in 30 minutes.  She was so kind and said if I wanted plain white whip she could make a batch for me.  She offered sprinkles giving me the color options.  I told her then and sharing here too ""Breanna, you are the best person in the world today!""

Thank you for saving the baby shower! (I picked up the other order after work...cupcake for days!)

Sam's Club has a shining star on their team! ✨️

Thank you Breanna!; Today, I went to Sam's Club and was thoroughly disappointed with my experience at the cafeteria.
After waiting in line for 15 minutes, I was told they didn't have whole pizzas available, only slices. The employee seemed unconcerned and unapologetic, which added to my frustration.

I expect more from Sam's Club, especially considering the membership fees and usual quality of service.; This is my first time visiting Sam’s Club with friend who has membership after 15 years membership of Costco. There are some items different from the nearby Costco but majority of the goods are the same. They definitely have more toys for kids and pool time. Their cupcakes and cheesecakes are amazingly tasty and much better than Costco.

The most notable part is the giant blue-and-white wall painting sign to guide your shopping which is intendedly missing in Costco to seduce you wandering around to spend more. The store has similar layout like Costco with huge shelves, but the aisles seems narrower, especially, the areas nearby cashier, I found hard time to move the shopping cart when facing another shoppers. And the store layout is not as organized and neat as any Costco.

One big surprise feature Sam’s has is the scan-and-pay self-checkout by App feature to skip the line. Overall, I won’t switch to Sam’s club or pay extra to get additional Sam membership because of the differences."

They lied about my prescription for 6 weeks. They told me it was my doctor and my insurance companies fault. I finally got in touch with my insurance company who said Walgreens have the authorization number for weeks. Dave a young man said he promised he have it in two days to me. Gave me his word. He ordered it but the wrong amount.  The girl who was rude said she'd call the insurance company to see to get that amount authorized. She hung up on me called me back said frys had the prescription and it was already filled waiting she lied. So fry's will order it in for me. I've never had this problem with fry's and will never use Walmart again. Whom ever the pharmacy manger is. Is terrible at their job. Poor training and accountability.; Would NOT recommend this location for ANY  pharmaceutical services!!!

HERE IT IS Day #3 and the prescriptions called in by hospital STILL HAVE NOT BEEN PROCESSED.

They should have been ready before leaving hospital,  since it is heart medication!!!!

Worst stocked Pharmacy in my life.

Hopefully,  you don't die waiting for your medication to show up.; Read whole review....The only way to give a review was to give 1 star. Went to Dr, I'm sicker than a dog and went to Walgreens to get prescription filled, waited in line 40min just to be told to come back in 2hrs. Waited 2 1/2 hr went back and waited in drive-thru for 50 min just to be told to go inside and my prescription would be ready. Took another 15-20min. Don't know how many people that I infected.; I have been enduring this pharmacy for over 3 years, sense I moved out to this end of town. The pharmacist is very rude and treats you like your business does not matter. I am having all my prescriptions moved to another pharmacy. I can not endure this anymore. When I told them I was leaving they said quote: ""do what ya gotta do"". The rest of the store is nice. Beware of the pharmacy, I have heard this has happened to many other customers. Hopefully Walgreens gets smart and gets rid of the pharmacist.
Update, they did get a new pharmacist. Much better service.; I waited in line at CVS and couldn't get any help, so we came to this Walgreens and the employees went above and beyond. Not only did they take the time to help me find what I was searching for, but when the checkout line got very long, an employee shopping at the store stopped what she was doing and clocked in to help out. My cashier took the time to make sure I used my rewards and was very friendly. I can't imagine the pressure they are under with staffing shortages, so it was so impressive to experience the caring and professionalism. The store was clean and well stocked."

A great place to go if you like to be treated like family!; Ryan,Lisa,Joel, and Will are good employees. Matt the owner is not good. Says inappropriate things to employees and customers (especially the women). Stay away from this place. This is all in my opinion of course.; I have purchased liquor and beer here on several occasions. I have always found the knowledge and locations of their products acceptable. However the service level and friendliness of their staff leaves a lot to be desired.

Their prices are reasonable to everyone else in the market. The convenience of their location is generally why I shop at their location.  This just may change if I can't even be greeted in a friendly manner when the store is completely empty.; Been going here for years and all the workers are really nice...I just had an experience where I guess they hired a new person. She asked for ID (which is totally fine) the one I have is expired by a day just waiting for the non expired hard copy to come in the mail. Never had anyone card me before and if they did of course I had it just in case. It's clearly me and I'm 30.  I just wish all the staff was on the same page because my sister comes in there with and license has been expired for over 6 months and they excepted that, that's what is bothering the most about the situation, and my sister was just up yesterday (2-10-19) once again they excepted the expired license. Definitely lost a 4 year customer, not that that matters anymore.; It's a liquor store. You can buy liquor."

The staff are consistently helpful and friendly, always ready to assist when needed. However, the food court can get quite busy, especially during peak hours like lunchtime, so I'd recommend avoiding those times if you're in a hurry. On the plus side, the self-checkout with the phone app is a game-changer – it's quick, efficient, and makes the whole shopping process much more convenient. A solid location for frequent shoppers!; Please use PRECAUTION while eating food out of the food court. The sitting area is never cleaned, tables are always dirty and floor full of trash. The soda machines are a health hazard and full of mold around the spout of the ice dispensers. I was shocked to see that and can only imagine if the outside has mold the inside of the soda machines must be much worse. 😳 They are always short staffed in that department.
The health department should definately be called and sent over to inspect because I for sure saw alot of health code violations that need to be addressed.; I am a current Costco member and have been purchasing at Costco for many years. After having several not so pleasant customer service experiences with Costco lately, I decided to give Sams a try.....and I was truly impressed.
The Sams system is much more advanced and fluid than Costco's. The app, for example,  allows you to purchase and scan your items without the need to have to check out at the checkout lines. Costco app does not do this. They are also not completely and utterly strict when it comes to membership. There is no ""walk of same"" exit in which you have to wait in line to get out and have someone meticulously check your card to make sure nothing was ""missed"". Now if you decide to check out, the self-checkout system is way ahead of its time than Costco's. Self checkout at Costco is a hit and miss and the scale is generally always asking you to place the item and often you have to have an employee come and push it through. This is NOT the case at Sams. At Sams, you don't even have to take anything out of your cart, you scan it right in your cart and done! Amazing! There is no weighting of items, there is no counting, you just scan, pay and go!
Now, I see some one-star reviews from people about the checkout and I honestly, have no idea why they are only giving out one star. My best guess is that they expected to checkout with a person and had to wait. I am sorry for those people, but we are in the 21st century now, everything is going automated so it is time to get used to it. The goal now is to see who has the better, easier and less annoying automated system and so far Sams is way ahead.... Costco has some catching up to do.
Setting up membership was also pretty easy, and there is no picture taking, you just setup your membership and get your physical and/or electronic card and that is it!
We also stopped by the Vision Center and the customer service there was outstanding. They were extremely friendly and very helpful while at Costco, I just feel like a number. They do the job they have to do and that's it.
When it comes to pricing, it is very close almost by the dollar, but several items I saw were about $1 or so less than Costco while few others may have been higher. However, one of things I noticed was that Sams has a lot more variety to offer. Looking forward, I think I am closing out my Costco membership once it expires.; I visited this Sams Club on 4/15/24 around 5:30pm their busiest part of the day and they only had one cashier stand open. I stood in line for 30 minutes. Terrible customer service. Whoever the manager was today was not doing their job. I won’t be back to Sams. I never have this problem at Costco.; Let me just start off by saying that I only use Sam's club because that's what my work pays for. It's sucks. Sam's club doesn't even compare to Costco when it comes to service and how they take care of customers. Sam's has 1 or 2 lanes to checkout with cash you have to stand in line for 30 mins just to check out. Employees standing around on their cell phones chatting it up with each other while we have to stand in line is unacceptable. When you ask if they can open up a new lane they tell you they can't do it unless my manager tells me to. Be better and do better!"

Enjoy!; Eron went above and beyond to help me find something I needed today. I really appreciated her time and effort, thank you so much!!; Well, it's Walmart and they did not disappoint. Went in for a bike for my wife. They had 2 sizes. We needed the small. Medium was on display. Was told to order small one for pickup. Arrived for pickup... They wheeled out the medium one. This was after specifically confirming we should order it and we could not just get it on the spot.
Cancelled the order.
Went to a different store for her bike.; I had the worst experience in the Auto Center. I needed to replace my car battery and the employee did not even attempt to help my determine which battery I needed. He just told me that they were in the aisle. There was no way to reference which battery I needed in the battery rack. I had to look it up on my phone.  Not a very good way to provide service to a customer. The next time I need to replace anything car related, I would rather pay extra to go to a car part store that is willing to assist their the customers."

Great Walmart supercenter with ALL the amenities. Tire service, outdoor living (propane tanks and exchange), full size grocery with Hot Deli and all the basic depts for whatever you need. This location also has a gas station with great coffee and lunch necessities.; 1 Staff members assisted us with questions, the gentleman who checked me out was cool. People in Arizona are not friendly at all and lack customer service, except these 2 employees kudos for them.; Amazing experience! 10/10 would recommend to a friend. Perfect date location; Walmart is always a busy place, even more so on a holiday weekend. I got what I wanted in the bakery, etc. and back home. Not too sure why their policy of using self check out changed, but if you're going to change this, then make sure there are plenty of regular checkstands open. There's nothing worse than standing in one of these lines.; Shoppings great.  But I'm sick & tired of people bringing their ""support"" dogs into stores. If they were actually trained support dogs they wouldn't start barking at every little noise or every dog they see"

This is insane.. with how busy this place is.. never seen lines this long and people waiting out in the main aisle, they only have 2 registers open. Only registers open are #24 and #30. Walmart.. higher more people. Just a horrible experience for shoppers that have a full cart. I agree.. I'm not getting paid to bag my own groceries. Sad to see where our world is going.; Shelfs are never stocked at this store. I've seen employees tell a customer helping them find an item wasn't ""Their job"". I don't work there but I stepped in to help the customer. Also, I've watched employees leave a bathroom a disaster and not say a word to anyone about it. Classy.; They say the deli opens at 8am. Well it's 9:24 am on Oct 10 and there is no way to get any delay food.  This is the third scathing review I have left regarding the deli at this Walmart. Get it together, turn on the menu sign, staff the counter so we can buy the food you have in the case. I'm tired of this B.S.! I even told the lady at the checkout that the deli is still closed and it's never open. She looked and confirmed it is closed.  So your own employees can see the problem plain as day.  This deli is like this for a reason.  They must only have it there for virtue. Anyhow Safeway has a deli that is staffed; Just want to recognize an amazing clerk . Her name is April. She is very personable and helpful to us. We are elderly and we do our best to shop only in her work days so we get her station.

New pharmacist are extremely rude . Say one thing than say something entirely different. Then so I asked again how many pills and what prescription is that is ready for pickup. Than phramacist telling me I’m wrong I’m not . Just trying to clearly what meds Walgreens has ready the price and how many times I take this new medication. Both new employees got rude with me so I told them please put back meds I go somewhere else. This is a medication involved my health . Nothing to mess with. Why is Walgreens always hiring new employees and not train them properly? Walgreens should either hire and train employees better. Customers deserve better. Thus not the 1st time this has happened here. Please do better by customers; Store is great! But BEWARE of the pharmacy -- Very disturbing that I get medicine that I DON'T NEED and that pharmacy tech will argue with you about their failed auto-reminder/auto refill system.  HORRID service.
I've been a customer there since they opened, getting many prescriptions for my mom when I was her caregiver and through my own cancer journey.
In the past 2 months their system has gone crazy, sending me refill reminders for meds I did NOT order which is very disturbing. I called Customer Service and they said I had to talk to someone at the store level, transferred me and I get the same horrid person each time I call and a supervisor is never ""in the building.""
Confirmed with my doctor as well, the office did NOT receive a refill request for the med I received when the person at Walgreens insisted that I had been the one who ordered it, I told her it must have been one on auto-refill that she didn't remove when we spoke the other day, the 4th time I've called about this problem with their failed automated system that she's defending.
Today makes my 5th phone call for the same unresolved problem. I know I'm just one person, but I'm moving my prescriptions to another RX service.; We were in the El Mirage area on vacation. Our prescriptions were coming due. The Pharmacy Dept. contacted our home pharmacy and got our prescriptions transferred. Worked out great! Thanks very much for your help! 👍; I have been coming to this pharmacy for years and each time I go the service is worse and worse. The attitude from the pharmacy technicians, Vivian in particular, is absolutely ridiculous. She is very condescending and rude. Customers should not have to put up with such behavior. I called and asked to speak to the manager only to be told he was filling in and there wasn't much he could do. I did the survey that was attached to my receipt and asked to be contacted. It is a week later and I still have not heard form anyone. In reading other reviews it seems that there have been other complaints about Vivian and clearly nothing has been done. My family will be taking our business elsewhere.; I stopped into Walgreens before going to work, dressed in my work  attire(scrubs). I noticed I was be followed and watched by a store employee. Being woman of color, I figured I was being racial profiled.  The employee that was following goes by the name of Jason, come to find out he is one of the store managers or supervisors.  I  will not be shopping at this location again.  This is the worst racist store ever"

We scanned everything and even showed ID for age restricted item. We started walking out following re-stocking our cart. I hear someone say ma’am a few times and it’s Samantha telling me I need to pay for my food. It was all of $50 worth of food so it wasn’t like we were racking it up trying to get out quickly. What makes me write this is that she was treating me like some kind of criminal. I come to Walmart a lot and I see her constantly. I’ve never had an issue with her, she just looks like she doesn’t want to be there. She rolled her eyes at me and I just told her it wasn’t done on purpose. You don’t need to act like that over a mistake. This really upset us how she treated us when a lot of them recognize us and it was straight to judgement without any true assessment. I’m aware walmart sees that a lot but I work in service and I don’t treat others that way.; This store usually has everything I’ve needed in stock. Always wind up buying more than need.

The pharmacist that ask if you have any questions instructed that I could take both pain meds at the same time. I decided to look into this on my own and found out that the fda does not recommend combining these as they counter react with eachother and cause slow heart rate and shallow breathing. Luckily I had enough commonsense not to do what the pharmacist instructed as it could of been fatal.; Normally I would say my interaction was fine. However, a month ago I needed to pick up a script my doc had sent in for a biopsy I needed prior to having surgery.  I went to the drive through not realizing what the med was.  As I waited for the script to be sent through the drive through tube, I heard a voice. The voice was through a public microphone from the pharmacist.  "" What do you neeed these pills for?"" Not expecting it to be an issue I simply answered that my doctor ordered it.  She then asked if I was having bleeding , pregnant, or other issues which confused me because I had no idea why she was asking.  I then said I was having a biopsy.  She sent the drug through the tube.  First, it's not your business as my doc ordered it. Second, you said this aloud and publicly. Third it's not your business.  I will be taking my business elsewhere.  The pill was to open my cervix for a biopsy to check for cancer before a hysterectomy. I don't need your pharmacist asking me personal information in a public setting for one or at all for two.Ridiculous.; Trying to get my medications has been a hassle.

One i've been out of for so long I have forgot how long it been.

So far been getting a off brand variant of the medicine.  The issue with this one is my doctor gives me 90 count pills and yet Walgreens loves to change it to 30 count, change the dosage and add to it no refills.

My insurance says I have 2 refills but bottle says none.

Plus more recently two weeks ago I had eye surgery.

Doctor gave prescription for eye drops I am to take for 4 weeks

I am going into week 3 and so far luckily the eye drops are lasting

Thing is doctor knows I will need refill on the eye drops.

I doctor even sent over a new prescription for the eye drops.

Walgreens claims not in the system. I need talk to my insurance and doctor to over write their system.

I have already talked to them.

Even manager was rude to me.

This Walgreens needs to be audited.

They don't deserve my money!; The pharmacy is very frustrating. I literally walked away because of their incompetence.
They switched to a central fill facility and you can only pick them up the day you are scheduled to run out.
They are super unhelpful when trying to get your meds ready for vacation.
I will be switching to another pharmacy immediately."

Of curious shoppers and employees, it was mortifying;  of course, they found nothing and let me continue shopping after that,  but I’ve barely gone back there at all since that happened, but I’m so glad I gave it another shot because Ernie went above and beyond to provide the best service..it might have been the best service I ever received from customer service before and hands down the best service I ever had at a Walgreens and CVS combined. If you’ve ever been discouraged by the staff at the Deer Valley location that they used to have I would totally go back into that store and give them another shot.

I hope to see them on the shelves within the next few days.; I went in to get my passport photo done and Colin was very helpful and full of positive energy. He did a great job.; The other day I bought a knee strap. To my surprise the strap was not in the box. I took it back to Walgreens and the manager switched it out with another one.

I came with My Baby to pick up a prescription which the app told me it was ready. My insurance always pays a couple days before the pick up date and they refused to give me my prescriptions due to “pharmacy policy”  which I’ve never heard before because if my doctor released it and insurance is paying for it then its of date… not sure if it’s because she’s new here but total waste of time and rude customer service…

thats fine if truly if its Walgreens policy” but to make faces when a customer asks for the pharmacist or send notifications that the my prescriptions are ready just to drive there with my baby after a long day of work and school to deal with rude unfriendly people is unfortunate.. walgreens you really need to do better.. ill be switching my pharmacy soon.. also got my flu shot here only to get my 25 percent off coupon they offered and they did give me anything.. i swear its always something here PLUS THEY TAKE FOREVER.. guys please chose another pharmacy unless you love being onhold for ever and waiting over an hour just to pick up your so called ready prescription

They don’t answer their phones - picking up a calling and placing it back on hold without speaking doesn’t count as answering. They don’t fill prescriptions in a timely manner and generally makeup reasons why something can’t be filled - anything from a back order to a recall when it was just that they didn’t get around to filling it.

The person that answered my call was very helpful with making sure they had my prescription available. When I arrived at the drive thru, I greeted by the pharmacy tech. The pharmacist was so kind and answered my questions. I received a follow up call a few days later to offer their support and to answer any additional questions. This is absolutely great customer service and great patient care follow up. This is very important to me especially because starting a new medication  can sometimes be worrisome. Although we can call on our providers for any concerns, pharmacists are more knowledgeable with any drug interactions and contraindications, so it’s wonderful that this Walgreens location is supportive. Thank you for a great experience! I’ll be using this pharmacy location from now for my family ."

Never had this experience with any other pharmacy.; George is super racist. Changed his attitude at the moment he had to help us. Mad about same deals the store had. Did not give me a deal on my stuff. I did not argue with him but it's really wrong of him to change the price after the deal my price was 18 something.

They both had refills remaining, so they only needed to call our home pharmacy for the transfer.

I was told that the pharmacist was talking to our home pharmacy as I stood at the counter & the scripts still didn't get transferred.  I called our pharmacy in  MN and the prescriptions had been transferred the day after we took them to Walgreens. So today, 10 days after we took them in, they were finally filled.  This is the LAST time we will ever use this pharmacy.; The pharmacist or pharmacy tech, either way the one with all the tats and wires hanging out of her nose, was not very kind and friendly in assisting me checking on several medications costs. I needed to know my out of pocket cost. She said she wouldn't know what the prices are until she ran the prescriptions through the system. I understand that but back in South Carolina they can and they can do it quickly. She proceeded to give me a discount card as if she looked at me and thought I was homeless or appeared that I could not afford my medicines. She seemed to be in a hurry. My gut feeling is she had other things to do more important than take care of a long time customer. I'm not going to use this pharmacy ever again."

Well, as soon as I walked into Liquor Therapy, I felt exactly that, thanks to Paige. This is literally more than just another liquor or package store. Trust me.
Paige's energy is genuine and vivid, and offers one a remarkable experience. (Just visit to try for yourself.) It's slightly difficult to explain, as experiences as such are becoming an antiquity.

Double kudos to her for providing us with awesome recommendations to check out in the city!

I will be getting Liquor Therapy every single day that I am in town. Simply, because of Paige and her loving energy! Thank you, a million times, Paige!

A++; You have a ""girl "", not a WOMAN working for you that does not get along with me. She made that abundantly clear to my husband this evening while he was shopping for me. Very unprofessional. We will not be spending another dime of our money there due to this. You've lost quite a few of my friends as customers as well. Save it for outside of work, Stephanie.  Personal issues do not belong in the work space.
Btw: if you don't want a trick, tricking your significant other into whatever it is she and her man do...

I've lately been noticing lots of rotting vegetables. This time, I came across boxes and boxes or moldy raspberries. Almost every single container I looked at had furry mold growing on berries. Look me a joke to dig down to a box that looked relatively okay.
Seriously disappointing service too. After so many years of never checking the membership card, all of a sudden employees run you down after you've already entered the store, asking for the card.; I shop at this store often but I used the optical dept for the 1st time. It has not been the greatest experience. Simply put, they need more help. I wait a long period of time to pick up samples a few weeks ago and now the order was ready as of today and I had to leave the store without them. I am done packing my patience and will not be using this dept anymore. It is ridiculous. 1 person to deal with the register and help people try on glasses is not effective. Several people were just standing around. Maybe they weren’t part of optical but where is the assistance? Even if someone called out, is there not a plan for things like this so that customers aren’t inconvenienced??  I now have to go back at 10am (pray I can make it back to work timely) to attempt to get my contacts, which I am COMPLETELY out of. I will never step foot over there again. Please do better.; We come to this Sam's club all the time I like the new tables in the food court. They are big and nice with kids now easy to sit and eat. The only thing I don't like big lines in the food court takes 25 to 30 min on weekends just order because the person who is taking orders will help a couple of people and will go and make food so there will be no one to take orders. They don't re stock toilet paper or wet wipes on weekends when we go most of the time empty.; I am visiting Phoenix to see doctors for serious medical conditions that I have that cannot be treated in Hawaii, and I offered to take my 91 year old host's vehicle to Sam’s to have 2 tires that were previously purchased & paid for before my 11 AM doctor's appointment in downtown Phoenix. When I arrived I was greeted by tire tech Odayne and had a friendly introduction. I explained why I was there and gave him the receipt and my friend's Sam’s card along with the appointment confirmation # that I got by phone the day before.. He immediately became very disturbed that the card-holder was not there to have this work done. Odayne grubbed ""he knows the procedure"" and I cannot do this unless he is here! I explained the car owner was unable to himself, so I offered to do this task. Odayne, became quite angry After my friend arrived & signed off, both techs were ""having fun"" avoiding the work at hand, smiling & joking with each other and looking at me through the window, letting me see that it was going to get done when they decided it would be done; not a moment sooner. They hadn’t even started tire removal until the vehicle was in the bay for 25 minutes. They took as long as they possibly could to finally get the tires back on the vehicle and then torqued each wheel 2-3 times with a break in between the torquing process.
At 9:45 I walked outside in the heat, which I shouldn’t have done and asked them ""please, please, please sir ""can you get the vehicle done so I can get to my doctor's appointment."" They both laughed and found my begging quite funny. After I ""begged"" for five minutes Odayne's co-worker asked me if I would like a bottle of cold water, as I was standing in the sun with obvious heat stress.
He approached me with a cold bottle of water, reached his hand out with it, and when I put my hand out for it, he pulled it away, laughed and walked away with it!
If anyone is thinking of patronizing this Sam's Club, I would suggest you find somewhere else to shop. Costco is not only faster & less expensive, but their people are courteous & most professional.
I found the Sam's Club #6608 Phoenix/Bell road experience shocking, revolting & from the phone mishandling to the greeter Sarah's ""flipping me the bird"" when I asked to take a pic of her name badge and will never set foot in a Sam's Club ever again!; Ordered cupcakes for a birthday party. This is how they were delivered. The driver should have been ashamed to deliver these.
I called customer service and they said someone would call me back. 2 hours later and still waiting for a simple phone call. Extremely disappointed.

It is now almost 4 hours later and customer service has no idea where the driver is to deliver the cupcakes. Got the same run around story as this morning, “trying to figure it out.”

The cupcakes were finally delivered!!"

I had my dog in the car so I didn’t want to go to a large grocery store or anything. I just needed to buy a deck of cards on my way to a family function. I ran to the cards and got up to the line by 3:51. I know because my alarm went off at 3:50 for me to get on the road. I was still in the line at Walgreens when my alarm went off at 4:10. There were two women working behind the counter. They didn’t acknowledge anyone in line nor did they have an ounce of polite customer service once I reached the register. They didn’t move with any sense of purpose and didn’t even speak to the customers. I’d be more understanding of a long wait if they were friendly, but they weren’t even that! At one point, someone else who worked there walked up, made eye contact with me, said NOTHING, walked over to the photo counter and pushed some items around the counter like she was bored and had nothing better to do than move a piece of paper two inches, and then she simply walked away... At that point in time, I was fifth in line. So basically, just like any Walgreens, they’ll carry what you need. But if you have anywhere to be— or a dog waiting in the car 🥺— Don’t come here. There are two other Walgreens in AJ. An alternative isn’t far away.; Outside of a few panhandlers & homeless, the silent/invisable pharmacy, slipshod photo department, the ghost town liquer department, this Walgreens is great!

At the scheduled time, no delivery, status indicated it would be delivered tomorrow... Tried to use chat to cancel then had to call,  no one could cancel the delivery... Not gonna try delivery from this location anymore... Try at your own risk; Total incompetence!
Staff becomes aggressively defensive when questioned about anything!
Their automated system is absolutely worthless, after receiving text and calling to let them know that you can't pick it up right away they agreed to put it in the hold bin for up to ten days and then they actually call every day to remind you!
Each time you of course get another associate who explains their computer is set up for the daily reminders even though a couple of them did actually check to see it was marked for later pickup because of being out of town!
So we're in the 21st century and the only way corporations want to communicate with us is on line but they can't input a message to their system of a requested pickup date?
So when I get there to pickup my RX
They tell me it's been put back even though I had spoken to at least 6 people who called to remind me that it was ready and  3 of the 6 actually went to the hold bin to verify pickup date!
Customer service is a thing of the past!; Pharmacy it totally incompetent! Made my daughter wait for over a week for the doctor to reply to a refill for important medication fax, while there was already a refill remaining on the script. Continues to fill prescriptions that I have repeatedly told them I do not take. Called to sort it out and pharmacy manager could tell me her name, possibly Nicole,” I have so many young people”!; The pharmacy here is totally unreliable.  I’ve come here twice within a week to pick up the same prescription, and both times the pharmacy is closed even though the hours indicate it’s open.  They should simply permanently close this pharmacy if it’s never open instead of holding prescriptions hostage.  If you actually are interested in being able to access your medication, I’d suggest not having the prescription sent to this Walgreens."

The pharmacy does an amazing job keeping up with the high demand daily.
This is a much smaller Walgreens than most I have shopped in. I wish they had a larger food section and more OTC meds . Anyway the checkout is good and very friendly staff Thru out the store.; This is my local Walgreens, and I have been there several times. It's a very nice store with friendly employees. They have a huge variety of merchandise too, and lots of good sales. Yesterday, my daughter and I brought my infant grandson to get his passport photo done, which was a fun experience .  We weren't sure how baby passport photos are taken, and employee Greg was extremely helpful. He took a photo with my daughter holding him and then he removed her image (very interesting process- see photos) I really appreciated Greg's patience and kindness through the photo process.; Reasonably well-run store. Normally clean & tidy. Usually understaffed, never anyone tending the photo department. Pharmacy is also well-run and attentive although typically long-lines during snow bird season.; I purchased knee support sleeves at this Walgreens, but found that they were not snug enough to give the support I needed. There was a buy one get, one half off, sale so the total price was $38.94. Six days later, I went back to return them to get a refund. I was told that in order to get a refund I had to present my driver’s license for them to scan into their system. I couldn’t believe it. If I was returning some expensive durable medical equipment, I might not have been so unpleasantly surprised; but could not understand why they needed to scan my personal information into their system for a refund of less than $40. Since I am on a fixed income, I could not afford to let them keep my money so I had to give them my driver’s license. I could see that my name, address and date of birth was retained in their system. I felt that my privacy had been violated. In addition, I felt that I was being set up for possible identity theft since so many companies have had their computer systems hacked; allowing hackers to gain access to customers personal information. In theory, a hacker could use the personal information that I was forced to allow them to scan in and go on the dark web and use it to find my social security number, too. Walgreens is creating another avenue for hackers to steal customers identity. I will never shop, nor fill any prescriptions, at any Walgreens again. After what occurred both of my sisters will stop filling their rather expensive prescriptions there. I have never, in over 60 years, been asked to present my driver’s license to get a refund! It made me feel like I was being treated like a criminal. What an insult, especially for such a small amount.; This Walgreens location, like many in the area, is in a shopping center where the owners do not clean. There is frequently spills and trash at the entrance and the parking lot as well. I can't fault them for the numerous homeless that camp out and sometimes aggressively ask for money. That is a political issue. No matter how empty the store and pharmacy are,  you will have a substantial wait. I feel that The pharmacists don't make a concerted effort to get in touch with doctors when a new prescription is needed. Items in the store are priced a bit high but usually you get store coupons to help with that. Basically, that is what keeps me coming back. Usually the employees are really nice."

I want to definitely give a shout out to Derek who is always working and helps me whenever I go in!! He is always so friendly and sweet and always super helpful!!!! He always has a smile!!! He definitely is amazing at his job and i appreciate him!; Highest turnover rate I’ve seen out of a pharmacy. Maybe they are crappy towards their employer maybe some leave because they don’t believe in the horrible way they treat the customers. Regardless of the reason, this pharmacy cannot seem to get it together. The store manager Cory only listens to your complaints but doesn’t make sure that the pharmacy is running smoothly on a consistent basis. I get the feeling he’s just there to collect a paycheck but not really concerned with the quality of service his store puts out. With so many pharmacies within a 5 mile radius, and with lower costs for scripts, one would think they would deliver superb customer service to KEEP their customers.

Plan on long waits and long lines. Where getting the customer in and out of there is not a priority.

If you call the pharmacy plan on someone picking up without saying anything and being placed on hold numerous times. Apparently answering the phone with “Walgreens Pharmacy please hold” is unheard of. And this may go on for a while.

The newest pharmacist, the man from India I believe is hit or miss with his customer service. He is fully aware that the phones are being answered by picking up and placing the customer on hold without speaking and seems to think this is fine if they are as he said “busy”. Interestingly enough, he was very customer friendly when he was first hired. He seemed to believe in quality customer service and restoring that at the store but maybe 2/3 months in, his habits were just as bad as the techs there. I guess he said what he needed to to get the position and that was that!

For the life of me I can’t understand why bother to get into customer service or anything that deals with the public if you aren’t a customer friendly individual? Is it just for the sake of having a job? And it is really sad because customer service, friendliness and the desire to give deliver quality has gone down downhill and voicing your concerns here at this store falls on deaf ears. So why bother?  Go elsewhere as we have done; I have had issues for years but it's finally gotten out of hand. They cancelled a controlled substance prescription 4 times causing it to be over a month late and withdrawals. When I tried to transfer the prescription away, they told the new pharmacy there were no refills even though it was a brand new prescription and the website shows 4 refills. Terrible service, high turnover, absolutely the worst pharmacy I have ever experienced. Three location convenience isn't worth it and I will never, EVER return; Absolutely worst pharmacy. Mistake after mistake with no accountability. Sad, as they used to be great.
Definitely finding a new provider.; photo order has been ready for over 4 days and the manager tried to tell me it wasn't there. he looked it up in the computer and said i didn't order anything since November. despite me showing him the order was ready. after arguing he actually looked in other bins. i also ordered a custom magnet and an employee left it on a shelf. i never got a call that my ship to store was ready. the manner manager tried telling me that wasn't there either. barely helped me without me begging him to look but he was more than happy to help search shelves for a pretty blonde. very racist."

From other reviews it sounds like this is a common practice.; Went here to buy a 6 pack showed my legal ID and was refused service because I have an out of state ID. I just moved here I'm 23 years old they said that they've gotten in trouble about ID'ing people. So I assume that they have been selling to minors, they informed me they just received a huge fine for it. Bottom line just completely rude high prices would not recommend.; Beer is over priced often significantly.  An example is the 3 bottles of Cantillon that have been sitting on the shelf for around 2 months.  Why, it’s $50 per bottle.  Other stores sold out quick with a sale price at a price of $24.99 to $30.00.  Look at the bourbon county.  Same thing, price raised and the beer sits.; The guy has great beer I'll give you that but watch  out with your ATM card he overcharge me 56$ then when I caught it  he got mad at me because  there  was a line he had to refund  me 36$ in cash it might  have been a honest  mistake  but it sure was sketchy.

Although, they don't carry some of the brands I was looking for that a local competitor carries (Weller). Definitely a great stock of spirits.

The beer on the other hand seems to be poorly managed. There's far too many choices from all over the world, but I think they'd do better focusing more on the great local craft breweries we have in our region (i.e. Moonraker, Moksa, Slice, etc.) as well as other California craft brewers. They do carry a lot of these, but we are so spoiled with great breweries in our area, so it would be great to focus more on offering more from our great state. There's just too many different beers from all over the world and it's not necessarily a good thing. Sure it's fun to do a beer tasting session of beers from other regions. A lot of the craft beers they get from other regions of the world are average according to Untappd. How about some of the top breweries such as Trillium, Hill Farmstead, Other Half, Tired Hands, etc.)??? And if you want cold beer from the fridge, it's slim pickings. Seemed like it was a lot of seltzers, Bud, Coors, etc. and a small amount of local craft breweries. Plenty of local competitors with better ice cold selections. The worst part is a lot of that beer is out of date.  I saw a lot of IPAs way past their 3-month freshness date. But I wasn't there for IPAs, rather I was there because it's Oktoberfest season. They had section devoted to this style, however I was specifically looking for this year's Sierra Nevada release. I noticed they had some so I grabbed two 12-packs. Turns out it was LAST year's release. I mean, I didn't even think to check the dates because what reputable liquor store would sell a lager style that is over a year old?! And it tasted horrible. When your supply is getting old, you need to have a clearance sale. No way I'll buy beer at this place again.; Me and my girlfriend went to see and take a look at the new stock on my day off and see what was available. The entire time I was being followed because I have tattoos and so does my girlfriend. When I was looking at the selection of mini bottles,  I was followed by an employee. My girlfriend was also followed from the bathroom and back to me when she was finished. The employees only left us alone after I paid for my items. We both felt extremely uncomfortable the entire visit and we have been there multiple times. We will be back again but please don’t profile us and do better as a company and people in general. 1 star.; I found my favorite Islays there, TG they carry Bowmore, and now I don't have to go to Bev Mo anymore where they don't sell to you unless everybody in your group is 21 and over. Which is stupid because some of us don't want to leave our kids in the car, and some of us are not buying anything and didn't bring our wallets or drive.

Thank you Total Wines for being normal and special thanks to Kim  the cashier who is super sweet and extra awesome.; Total wine has the greatest prices. The employees are very helpful and nice. They know all about their products!! I get great service every time I visit, no matter the location.; I went on the soft opening night. This turned out to be very informative. I was able to talk with experts about different wines and bourbon.  I went in only to purchase a bottle of whiskey but came out with whiskey, wine and some Moet.

Taking away 2 stars due to checkout employees always asking if I want to sign up for their store credit card. First it’s TJMaxx, then Best Buy, and now Walgreens asking about credit cards. No thanks, I don’t want your 34.99% interest rate credit card to ruin my credit. 🙄😡; Bought 2 packs of camel wides a couple days ago for $19.26. Went in yesterday and the same 2 packs of cigarettes are now $25.47. 3 dollars more per pack. Some would say inflation but let's call it what it really is. GREEDFLATION.; UPDATE:  CORPORATE HAS BEEN NOTIFIED!!! The pharmacy staff from the techs to the pharmacist are all rude and make you feel like you are bothering them.  Then when you are told over the phone that you can pick your rx up and you go and then they tell you that it's too early come back another day.  I am a pharmacy tech myself and I would never treat patients like they do. Most of the time it's  either you can't get your rx cause by their calculator it's too early or it's out of stock and you have to wait till it comes in and there are no deliveries over the weekends.  I have gone several days before without meds cause they do not have it in stock.  This pharmacy used to be good and now it barely gets one star from me.  I will be changing to a whole different pharmacy company from here on out.  Unbelievable how they are ALLOWED to treat patients.  I will be calling the corporate office and letting them know this is not right. You would think with all the negative reviews something would have been done already; The manager at Broadway and Kolb is very young and naive. She doesn't have good math skills and should not be working in retail.  She is very young looking,  with short crooked black hair and white makeup,  goth look, which is funny because she belongs to FLDS CULT and is a mormon missionary.  I was overcharged and she refused to even look at the receipt, she didn't appear to know math and wouldn't add it herself,  all she said was the computer never makes mistakes,  which we all know computers do make mistakes.  Not sure how she made manager,  because everyone knows the FLDS CULT  doesn't work,  they steal from government.  So her mission is stealing at Walgreens; Went to pick up a prescription and had a horrible experience with the pharmacy tech. First she had a nasty attitude with me after I relayed that I had pre-paid for my prescription so I just needed to scan the barcode. She then proceeded to cancel out the phone number process for rewards. When I asked to put my number in, she said she had to void the transaction and proceeded to rip everything out of the bags and slam it on the counter. After getting it voided, she aggressively told me to give her the bar code and to put my number in correctly this time. I don’t appreciate this experience especially considering this is the second time I’ve dealt with an unfriendly tech. I would hope in the future that behavior isn’t allowed. I will not be going back to get my prescriptions from this location."

My dr prescribed me a freestyle Libre because my sugar levels have been going high because of steroid injections I have to use.   This is easier for me to see my sugar levels regularly. I saw my order pending and walgreens took it upon themselves to cancel my order because of the high copay price. Why would you assume the patient can't afford it and cancel it? I needed this because I can go into a diabetic shock. Now when I called today they told me they would reorder it but now I have to wait another day to get it which I will be out of town. The pharmacist laughed when I asked why they didn't call me before canceling it? She said because that would be too many people to call. So you would be ok with the person dying canceling a med because you feel they can't afford it? Why not give the patient the price and let them choose??? This is beyond unacceptable!!"

I have had immunizations here numerous times. I never had to have an appointment!

This place is literally falling apart and I fail to see how it can remain in operation in the long run.; Aside from the pharmacy folks, all the staff, by and large, is rude.  This morning, I walked in to pick up a prescription, and the pharmacy was closed.

If your friend is in line, get their phone number, and talk to them later. We all have a sad story to tell, but don't do it on work time with people waiting. I can guarantee that today is a tougher day for me then that lady for reasons I don't care to disclose. So please, can we just do our jobs, then go home and do whatever we want? Please ffs; Update:  It has been many months since I have been here ... The store looks cleaner, the shelves are stocked and everyone was  friendly.

Went to the back pharmacy no customers in line, waited for 5 min. While 2 workers at register. One tall lady (worker)  looks at me and walks back to her shelves while the other still at register. I thought perhaps the man (worker) was busy still waited. Another man comes and goes straight to him and attends to him, both him and the other tall lady oblivious to me waiting there not even acknowledging me both seeing me wait however not letting me know they will be right with me, nothing!. Was upset another person walks up and gets attended! These workers need to be more attentive! Disregarded myself as a customer, unacceptable!! Horrible customer service!!!

When I arrived I check in. Waited for 35 minutes after my scheduled appointment. When I was called up the pharmacist was flustered and said that they didn’t have the vaccine I requested and she doesn’t understand why I was allowed to schedule the appointment in the first place.

Friendly staff; I don’t know whyyy.. but when you press those buttons for assistance?! for the things that are behind glass. I swear its actually a button for the associates to hide from you and not get you what you need. You’re lucky if you get one associate to help you and that’s if you actually stay there and wait 10, 20, 30 minutes later. Orrrrrr when you go up to the cashier and keep asking then after like 10 times if they can call someone. Sometimes you’ll just end up walking away and leaving without the product you were gonna get.

Great job Walmart Flagstaff and stellar employee Matt!; For Walmart, this store is exceptionally clean. And organized, it is a small Walmart compared to the ones on the East Coast. But as I said, it's exceptionally clean and organized. The people are friendly and pay attention to your needs when you ask them a question.  And they try to help you the  best they  can. This is one of the better walmarts I have been to across this country.
Good management makes a big difference.
I came here from Dothan, Alabama, which has absolutely the worst Walmart and Sam's Club in the entire country and if you travel to Dothan Alabama unless it's a necessity, I suggest you avoid Sam's Club and  Walmart.; I was excited to find out that they had a tens unit that I needed for my mother‘s pain.

Went in with broken nose pads on my glasses asking for help with a possible repair that, as a senior with shaky hands, I couldn't do on my own. I was assured by Barbara that she would be more than willing to assist me. She proceeded with the repair immediately while I waited. She fixed the problem adding new pads and screws, adjusted my glass frames, cleaned the lenses and was beyond helpful to me with a bright and cheerful attitude.

Kudos to Sam's Optical for their willingness to help with these, what might be considered ""bothersome"" repairs, and for having such positive employees like Barbara representing them. Sam's Club is the BEST in my book for their unusual customer service!; This samsclub needs to hire young people in the gas station,  this guy was mad of me because I ask for help, when all he was doing was been on his phone,  he told me that he dosen't want to help me, the pump #1 was having issues and he was telling me that I wasn't a member,  or that I don't have money  to 😡😡 so I move to pump #11 and got gas there, he was mad of me for making him doing his job 😡 I will post pictures,  there is an old lady also that is not nice that old too"

I wasn't  going anywhere,  I'm disabled  and had my grandbabies with me. This has just been a really crappy store since you have the carts running  people over ( Happened to us on Sunday). Customer Service really isn't  there anymore !; Poor customer service & horribly run delivery service, but, it is Walmart so what can you expect.  Lazy drivers who prioritize smaller light weight higher paying items to deliver instead of something weighing more than ten pounds.  Good luck if you're mobility impaired and/or don't have transportation, you're going to be stuck waiting forever for something to get delivered even though when you checkout it says same day or next day delivery.  One order went from same day to a week later, after not being delivered the same day.  The next order was just completely skipped.; Overall, the place was clean and well stocked.

The only gripe I have is with the checkout. Lack of NFC enabled and high traffic through their POS caused paying for my stuff to take longer than grabbing it all due to ""card read errors"" from inserting.

If you go, use Walmart pay or their scan and go feature to avoid this unnecessary hassle."

Great stop and excellent location :); The Walgreens brand has let me down yet again. I started coming to this location whenever I was in town, and brand executives continue to disappoint me with their decisions. I was always helped by this one employee when i visited, very hardworking and friendly. Then he disappeared. Sources confirm he was fired for defending himself against a belligerent drunk man who laid hands on him when he was declined an alcohol sale. They tell me the store manager was fired, too, for this incident. The drunkard was simply banned from the location itself, no charges pressed while 2 people lost their job. Once again, I’m seeing why employees prefer fleeing WG. I fled 1.5 years ago myself, how sad to see no improvements made for the wellbeing of essential employees. No wonder locations across the board are consistently shorthanded.

Shout out to Toby. He went above and beyond . Thanks so much !; When this pharmacy was a full service 24 hour shop it was amazing.

I also scheduled it online but I assume that didn't matter since they didn't even bother to check. 46 minutes later they let the people who came in after us to get their shot instead of us. I'm never coming to this Walgreens again.; TERRIBLE... AWFUL SERVICE. Please use another Walgreens location other than Sunlakes. There is very poor communications from pharmacy employees. Customer service is unexceptable. This pharmacy service location staff needs alot of training.; Constructive criticism:
Okay as a person who used to come to the store on the behalf of others, it used to be really good. And the pharmacy to the makeup 'girl'who used to help with cosmetics . yes there was one!😀The last maybe three to four years when they laid off their old staff- meaning mature 40+ you saw a slow but declining stage of customer service start. Now maybe they have really terrible rules but I know is your staff is getting younger people in college and this is probably their first serious job either out of school or they're still in school they don't know anything about customer service. They're not well-trained and probably not educated about the medications they're handing out.  Instead of hiring college kids ( with the OK boomer mentality) you should hire people who live closer to the area actually care to have a job and are trained in pharmacy. Or start seriously screening them for attitude and aptitude . I think it's probably harder to get a job at Target than  in this Pharmacy judging by the turnover .Also maybe a course in empathy and learning how to deal with certain situations they need to learn to diffuse and handle sometimes difficult people otherwise you shouldn't be in customer face to face service.

But go ahead keep losing business and frustration SL residents. This used to be one of the friendliest drug stores I have ever encountered, and I've been around a while and while not a resident of Sun Lakes I was quite impressed back then it's only in recent years that I've seen real cs problems and that was before covid.; I made a mistake.  I transferred my medications here.  The prices I was quoted were not honored...  In fact.  they apparently go up $20 a day?  The non-english speaking pharmacist claim the prices change every day?    This place takes advantage of seniors in the neighborhood.  There is a special place in hell for this brown pharmacist.; Everytime I come in to the pharmacy for my Mom's prescription there's a problem. The technicians ignore you when your at the drive-thru.  I went there to get an rx on 3-19. One tech said she'd be right with me. The other technician just ignored the drive-thru.  I sat in it for almost 5 minutes without being offered any help. As a former employee, a Senior Tech and a Manager at Walgreens, I know customer service is VERY important. Ignoring the drive-thru and filling a prescription instead is a big no no! I came in the store and and wasn't going to yell, until the Male technician went over to the drive-thru right after they pulled up, yet he didn't bother to help me while I sat there. I also notice the pharmacists sitting on stools all the time also very unprofessional as they yell out your medication and what to do with it while sitting on the stool instead of getting up and talking directly to you in a private manor.  I also came in another time and was standing in line to be left there while 2 waiters were helped before me. Unacceptable! I was in line I should be helped before them, unless it's an emergency then I understand. There were 2 other technicians and one was just wandering around, so I made a stink about how I should of been helped.  These technicians aren't very customer service friendly.  If I had the right to move my Mom's rx's I would have her go to CVS, not Walgreens! Walgreens treats their employees terribly and it shows in their work ethic.  None of the managers or sales team are friendly either.  I have walked past both without any acknowledgement.  As a former employee and someone who greeted EVERYONE and acknowledged EVERYONE, I find it very offensive. I hate Walgreens and hope to get my Mom to switch! Too bad a once good company has gone so bad."

Trying to find out about my medications. After about the third time of her cutting me off, I had to ask her to please let me complete my sentence without interruption, like why am I having to ask a grown adult not to interrupt. Mind you I’m the first customer of the day, so it hasn’t been a long day. Then I used to have state insurance but now have insurance through my work. State insurance won’t let you auto refill. So I give Her my new insurance card which she puts into the system and proceeds to turn around and tell me that I still can’t get auto refills because the state insurance is listed as a secondary insurance. Then One prescription was ready but they still had to fill one so I asked how long and she said well we just opened so it’ll be a half hour and I said OK I’ll just that’s fine. I’ll come back and she said you’re gonna come back for both of them in a half hour and I responded yes and said she just hung up the phone and walked away, super rude, terrible customer service, And I might just change to the Walgreens in town and even though I’ll have to drive further at least I won’t have to deal with this rude woman; Ordered online so I could pick up in store at the photo counter. No one was at the photo counter, so I grabbed my package and took it to the register to check out. Male manager at the checkout stand. He was VERY RUDE and chastised me for retrieving my package. He said next time I had to contact the register and have a clerk called to the photo counter and that it should take less than 15 min to get someone to help me. Question? What is the purpose of ordering online then having to wait and extended period of time to pick up my order? Additionally, he said that if I ever retrieved my own package again (the one I bought and paid for), they could refuse the transaction. Not very customer friendly. Ive worked in retail for years and I HAVE NEVER treated a customer like that. And if I would have, my boss would have been all over my a$$. There are plenty of other businesses in town. I think I will start using those instead.; Kevin the evening cashier is extremely rude. Won't listen to the customer; I don't trust the automated messages about prescriptions, but that seem to be true everywhere. Good, well stocked store with staff that know the stock. It's also a place you can have deliveries from FedEx routed and foil the porch pirates, so I love that.; Automation Bad!! My medications are always late. I've driven 136 miles 3 times . Being told to pickup my medications. Each time Not ready and told to return in a day or two. Now I've been waiting 10 days for night medicine. I hope this next 136 miles they are?¿??"

Every person I've met from that department are always so friendly and hard-working.; The supervisor is out of control, very unprofessional. I just witnessed him yelling at his employees and another customer in the pickup area. Not sure if he can handle or be trusted around humans. I'd recommend giving him a timeout. I think it'd do everyone involved some good.; Garden department needs attention! Plants thrive if watered properly!!! Conveniently located, employees have become friends thru the years and banking nearby... What more could one want!❤️; I usually have a positive shopping experience at Walmart. While I understand the need for employees to occasionally check receipts, I was taken aback when a particular employee singled out my husband and me, inspecting our purchases and even removing a bagged tripod I had bought for DIY maternity photos. Despite me mentioning the price to help her out, she made a doubtful face and used a price machine to verify it. It was frustrating, especially since the receipt clearly showed the item name and price. Like many others have previously pointed out, If Walmart is concerned about theft, why not open more cash registers instead of relying on self-checkout?; The greeter was really nice the only thing I don't like is self checkout.If you have a lot of groceries it's hard to do self checkout.

Also, they seem to go out of their way to hire as many college students as possible who exemplify younger people today ( won't do anything outside their job description or anything extra ). 3 employees walked by me, never acknowledged me or stopped to pick up anything on the floor everywhere.
I work for a Fortune 50 company. We would write the mgr on duty a warning.; Very appreciative of the managers Gage and Kyle! I was gifted a lot of diapers that were not on my registry nor did I have a receipt to them and as many know, babies go through sizes quickly. I had heard from a friend you could attempt to return them for store credit and so I did. At first, the employee who originally helped me told me unfortunately it wasn’t possible to return nor exchange but I asked to speak to a manager and Gage and Kyle were the ones who helped me make it possible so shout out to them!; NAU move in days and this place was PACKED!! The employees were doing their best you could tell. We were one of the last to move in and gather last minute items. To my surprise they still had plenty of items in stock. A few were sold out but that was no biggie. I am appreciative of the employees handling the chaos as best as they could.; Me and my sisters went into target to shop around a little bit and decided to grab some coffee from Starbucks before we left. This was 2 hours before they closed and from what I could tell there was one person working and we were the only ones in line. We stood there for a little bit as the worker was cleaning up but didn’t acknowledge our presence and continued to do whatever she was doing. We moved closer to the front to hopefully grab her attention and she stared at the computer and then back at us. She finally decided to say “how can I help you”. She was pretty short and not friendly at all. Her face said it all before I even began to order. My friend approaches me and goes under the black divider and the worker shouts “You’re not aloud to go under there!” Doesn’t try to be nice about it at all. Needless to say I’ve never experienced a worker with such a bad attitude taking it out on customers. I’m not one to write reviews but I also work in the food industry and would never ignore a customer waiting. A simple “I’ll be right with you” should’ve been said.; This generation is a joke of employers. They sit there at customer service on there chair don’t even get up to greet you , I felt like I was disturbing her . Employees just walk on past you with out asking if you are finding everything!

The couple times I have had to stop here when passing through, the staff is either just straight up rude for no reason, or unhelpful. The actual store itself is overall nice as far as appearance, and the one saving grace is the manager called me after leaving a bad survey one time.

Definitely will not be stopping at this Walmart again; I only buy a limited number of items here, mostly food, because of the prices.
As everyone knows, if you want to save money, this is the place to go. Sometimes the prices are even better than what you can find online (Amazon).
This is a HUGE store, so it has nearly everything you might be looking for.
Easy parking. Easy in and out of the lot.
Probably the best place in Flagstaff for travelers needing to stock up while on a journey.; Friendly staff, all with a smile, and well organized store!

Let me tell you so was blown away with how clean and ORGANIZED the store was.  I can’t remember what day it was but it was around 9:30PM.  I try and avoid the Walmart’s here in VALDOSTA (Marketplace is nice!) because everything is a terrible experience starting with the parking lot. Cars park wherever and the employees stand around talking.  I was so impressed with the staff in Yuma I had to let a few know how impressed I was.  Even the clothes were on the correct hanger size and in order from S-2XL, I ended up buying a couple high school t shirts just to spend more money.  I took those pics to show the wife, she was like wow!; I received excellent customer service from an associate named Ramon. This night a lot of workers were stocking the grocery department and had many palettes lined up blocking the product I needed (oatmeal). Ramon was nice enough to acknowledge me so I asked him for help. He quickly grabbed the palette jack and moved the entire palette out of my way for me to safely choose which brand of the specific product I wanted. I knew I wanted one he could have maneuvered to reach but instead chose to go out of his way for my convenience and safety. I continued shopping and later noticed him kindly helping another customer walking him a ways across the store for the item he needed. Great costumer service! I am happy to deal with a human who acknowledges the needs of others and not another soulless employee that reminds us to use the app, is bothered for being distracted for the task he’s working on and shows little or interest in assisting. I live very near this store and frequent it regularly. His attentiveness and kindness is what made me leave you all a ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ review.; I like this location on Pacific because it often seems to be less crowded than Ave B or 8 E. Of course now in June there isn’t the overload from the winter visitors so that’s a huge plus.; All right let's be honest Walmart is still the best prices if you don't mind the crowds because it's the best prices this is where I shop when I have the time; This is our local Walmart so always a good time here.  Pretty much know everyone of them    Great people!   Very clean store organized comfortable and friendly!"

Leave me alone, I just paid $7.50 for a jar of peanut butter.; I showed up early to the auto department for a battery change, ROGER was extremely helpful even though he had a line of cars waiting. Every single technician asked if I needed help, although I did not because ROGER had everything under control. I explain to ROGER I would come pick my car up after work if needed and find a ride, but my car was done within an hour.

I fixed that by telling him the vaccine is bad and walk away.   He walked away and the terrible tech was very angry at me for this.    They shouldn't be pushing this crap like this.; I go here almost everyday as its across the street from me. The store is clean and always well stocked. The employees are friendly and it's easy to get help as theres always employees around. Sarah at the registers always helps me find what I'm looking for and Joy is really friendly at the customer service desk as well. The food at the deli is always hot and fresh as well. Overall good location; My experience at this Walmart was great. There was this worker that I think was named Sarah, she was great at her job. I saw her cleaning the registers and stuff like that.

I spent probably 30 minutes looking and couldn't find anyone else to help. Anyone else that WAS there saw me and just turned around and went a different way. I won't be coming back to this location.; Zero if I can give it to you Walmart. Went yesterday to the 83rd location and customer service was horrible. I can't remember when I ever had some decent customer service at this location. I asked the guy at the electric department if he could help me. Told me "" if it's not there we don't have it"" No kidding that is why I'm asking for help because there is a glass case and I can't move things around to see if it's there. The worst words anyone can say to a customer is IF ITS NOT THERE WE DON'T HAVE IT. Such laziness at Walmart. You can easily go over there and help move things in the case. Or look it up on your computer. Wow and there was no one at your department. You were just standing around doing nothing. Such a disappointment but not surprised at Walmart. Keep hiring people like that... it's the face of the company!!!!; My biggest annoyance about this location is how aggressive and rude in tone most of the employees are. After their remodel, it seems they care less about the customer and just about making money. After today, I will be less likely to shop at this location, if I have to remind an employee not to touch my phone, and rather use his words to ask me to show the receipt.
I don't know the last time that this employee has washed their hands or what kind of germs they carry, and especially with another pandemic, looming around the corner, do better about training your employees not to touch customers personal belongings.; The store is very clean, well organized.

Thank you for reading my Google review; Pharmacy staff is extremely rude. The man who took my call literally yelled at me as I was trying to explain what was happening with my prescription. Talked over me and down to me while also screaming at me. Absolutely unacceptable and inappropriate. Appalled you allow your staff to act this way.; Rude, Rude, RUDE!  I took my 95 yr old mom to have a passport picture taken.  We waited 15 minutes for someone to come by the photo center.  I pressed the button, the lone cashier called out on the PA to no avail.  We were getting ready to leave when the rudest, most inconsiderate man, comes racing by.  ""What do you need"", he says with an attitude. I need a passport picture.  ""Who is having the picture taken?"" My mom.  He snorts ""Can't do it, she is wearing a white shirt.  (It was a light rose colored blouse) ""Needs to be a dark shirt for a passport picture"".  Whaat?
He was nasty and frankly, the lone cashier was not anymore personable.  The help seemed pissed off to be there.
Luckily, Staples is just across way.  My mom & I walked into Staples, were promptly greeted, the photo taken, and 5 minutes later we walked out the door with the passport photos in hand.
Whoever is managing this Walgreens should be sent to customer servicing school so they can provide appropriate training to the staff.  They are to put it mildly, AWFUL."

You call in a RX, they tell you pick up any time after X, you arrive after that time, literally 95% of the time they tell you, it’s not ready, come back tomorrow, come back in 2 hours, etc.  They gave us the wrong medication one time, luckily we realized prior to taking it.  This has to be the biggest liability pharmacy in the country and Walgreens continues to do nothing about it.  If not for the insane insurance in this country forcing you to use certain pharmacies, this place would be out of business.  There is ZERO chance anyone chooses to go there because they get great service, friendly staff, etc.  This has been going on for years, WAKE UP WALGREENS!!   Unfortunately, it will take a lawsuit before they act.  You should be ashamed Walgreens, allowing this to continue for years !; The most awful pharmacy and staff I’ve ever been too. Bad attitudes, no accountability, bad prescription system. Two hour wait and told to check back after lunch. This is a recurring problem. Go anywhere else , also don’t trust your doctor to send in the scrip digitally. They send it but this becomes an excuse to hide behind. Bring it with you so they can’t shrug at you for two hours then take lunch; Picking up my girlfriend’s prescription and this has to be the slowest pharmacy I’ve ever been to. Both lanes pile up fast. Be prepared to wait 20+ minutes in line. I’d recommend you go elsewhere and avoid the headache; Trashy, rude, obnoxious, employee. Why would you want to hire someone like that to interact with customers her name is  Madison. She  must hate her job and people.

When I called and asked what to do, they informed me to “bring the bottle in and /maybe/ they’ll fix it.” I’m done. I’d like to add that I waited over an HOUR in the drive thru lane behind 10 different cars. Absolutely insane behavior.; Dear Walgreens,

You have a pharmacist here in Kingman AZ who believes he has more education and understanding of my child’s medical condition than their trained psychiatrist of the last, over 2 years.

My child has schizoaffective disorder with bipolar tendencies and psychotic features, severe generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, hypersomnia and panic disorder.

We have spent over 2 years and 3 hospitalizations to find a medication regimen that would keep our child safe, out of psychosis and finally at base line. Do you know what it’s like to have to admit your child and not be able to bring them home? To stay up all night long praying that they know how much you love them and that you would be right by their side, every second, if you only could?

Twice now this pharmacist has refused to dispense my child’s medications basing his refusal on his “contract” with the state.

However, he seems to be the only pharmacist in the area who disagrees. I would absolutely understand hesitation and wanting to speak with the prescribing physician first but he has spoken to him and his MA numerous times.

Multiple times he has told us that we are wrong and that our psychiatrist, who is based in Idaho, is not licensed here in AZ. That is false.

The first time he denied my child their med, we were in the emergency room not even one week later with psychogenic seizures and muscle deterioration. Will you be paying these medical bills?

The second time he denied, yesterday, his exact words were “go back to Idaho and have the med filled if you want it. Otherwise their Dr needs to come up with a ‘better plan’.”

I am not sure how to get ahold of someone at the corporate level or who that would even be but I would really appreciate hearing back regarding this situation.

We have obviously switched pharmacies but I am sure we were not the first people he has done this to and we won’t be the last. This is negligence. Unfortunately, he was not very forthcoming with his name in the drive thru but his initials MIGHT be AL. I will be figuring out his full information though and will be filing a formal complaint with the Arizona State Board of Pharmacy.; We come to walgreens for our vaccinations every year. The process is easy and quick. The pharmacist who gives the shots is gentle and puts you at ease. Would recommend this pharmacy for easy and convenient vaccinations.; I went through the pharmacy drive thru for my mom's medication and the lady rolled her eyes and made us wait until she was done eating to talk to us and made us feel like an inconvenience. She proceeded to be rude as we gave her information. Don't know her name but she had a bunch of facial piercings, go figure.; Terrible customer service.Very rude and hangup the phone instead of listening to customers.Im going to find another pharmacy.Never text you when your meds are in like they say,ect"

I walked toward the back and as I got closer to the counter the black female working asked what I needed.

I said ""I think I'm going to take a look in here."" While the coolers in the front are fully accessible to the public there's a weird layout and partition on the back end. So in that moment I realized that perhaps I wasn't allowed where they kept the canned beverages. (These must be easier to steal. The neighborhood isn't great.) It genuinely could have gone either way. I politely asked ""Am I allowed to go back there?""

The response was dripping with snark: ""No, that's why I asked what do you want."" My reaction was ""With that attitude, nevermind."" and I turned right around heading straight for the exit and she started yelling at me throwing a total fit.

This lady may be absolute clueless about her tone. That's very possible. Nonetheless there is zero chance I will ever go back. This place clearly only exists to serve people within walking distance.

I will not be coming back. This has happened on to many occasions. African Americans go to Las Amigo's. Much better service from all aged groups of employees.
Update: 3/6/23, went back 😆. Not overcharged this time. Still recommend Las Amigo's, The younger male and female tonight seemed annoyed I arrived at this location. What did I do?; I went in looking for a nice lighter. The man was so rude , there was a line and I realized that. If I had wanted to make a purchase I would have got in line .

I then said "" but if you don't sell them I don't want to wait in line 10 minutes for nothing""
He said "" you need to go out the door we don't have lighters""

There's a drive thru as well so that's a bonus for those that don't like to get out of their vehicles. I miss coming to these kind of places but I don't really drink as much anymore or smoke.

Asked him for a bag and he said ""dont be rude. does it look like im done?"" i dont understand how that was being rude.He also got mad because i wanted to pick my lime, not grab the one he gave me. The other guy who works on weekdays is very nice no complaints there. The rude one there now should just stay home with his rude attitude and personality.; If you are looking for bourbon, go elsewhere. I thought I walked into a liquor store, what I found was a museum. They charge over msrp on most items and price gouge on the sought after ones. Most of us in the whiskey community want to support local stores, however, we will never spend money at these places. They make hundreds in profit selling one bottle, in turn they lose thousands in sales from people like me.

Don’t support stores who gouge."

Showed up a little early as the last one was coming off the printer, come to find out they wrong paper was chosen and it wasn’t the adhesive backed option. No problem I’ll come back later. Brought up the missing item from a month ago. Manager said I was lying and never spoke to her, then after further investigation remembered me. Come in to pick up items a day later and they are trying to force me to buy the mis-printed items “at a discounted rate” explaining how much money I’ll save.

As a mom to twin boys, it was cool to find a card that was twin themed.

The shelves are ALWAYS neatly arranged. It really is amazing how this young lady takes care  of her store.
She would be a shining example of someone who really cares and sets a wonderful example of how a store could impress others.
I appreciate having a chance to thank you.; Obviously everyone knows about this drug store chain. Their standards and service are consistent across the stores, so you know what you are going to get most times. One thing I like about this location is the very good staff they have that works in the evening.

On this evening on a Wednesday, I was in need of getting a passport photo. I hesitate to go to a busy store in the evening since people are often going to stores after work. I dread standing at a photo center counter waiting for a long time for someone to come grudgingly to help that annoying interruption called the photo customer. But this was the absolute opposite of my experience here.

At this local Walgreens, the staff came quickly to the photo counter. They took the pictures, and went to work immediately processing them. Of course, I can get all my drug prescription needs and over the counter meds taken care of here too, along with the regular conveniences of such a store.  But the highlight of such a place is the staff. They make all the difference. One of the failings of many stores is the poor training of staff that end up treating customers as though they are a bother or inconvenience.  Not so here.

Customer service is king, and it is nice to see a place that takes it seriously.; This is legit one of the best Walgreens in the valley! Everyone is so nice and helpful. I will purposely go out of my way to go to this store because they are just that great of a location!"

I needed to know if there would be tax on it because I had a certain amount 9f money on me at the time. She didn't know and instead of telling me she didn't know and walking off this Manager took the time to go out of her way to ring it up and find out while she said ""go ahead and continue shopping and I will find you""! She came back with the answer! Thank you again for your professionalism and kindness. It's employees like you who people think about and make want to come to the store.

Staff is always helpful. Great deals on tires too.; Awesome!  Clean store, great produce, great meat counter, not crowded at all. We normally go to the other place and while we are loyal members, it's way too crowded no matter what time of day you go. Sam's has a lot more variety. We got a discounted membership for $14 a year and then $10 off to use the Scan and Go, where we scanned our own items with our phone. Highly recommended. We will be back.; I watched the cafe cut up pizza and have the icee machine running while telling me all they are out of both of those items that I pre-ordered. They offered me a pretzel which I don’t like and refused to give me a refund. If I wanted a pretzel I would have ordered a pretzel. The cashier also looked clueless and tried to weaponize her incompetence so she wouldn’t have to help

Upon looking at recent reviews, I am not surprised to see that I am not the only one upset with the service. The staff needs to get it together. Not to mention when I went to get a membership the lady at the counter called me over, only to immediately send me to the next person at the counter; causing another guest to have to get sent back in line, all so she could help someone who cut in line with a previous issue. And after the Second person started helping us, she came to interrupt to try and try to make sure what she did wasn’t wrong (it was), and her interrupting us finally being helped only put a bad taste in my mouth.; Came in from out of town and was asked to grill two nights for a large group. Sam's had everything and for a great price. So lucky to have this store available.; I just got another new membership at Sam's and had problems with Sam's credit card payment as I had not yet received my new card.

They indicated it would be submitted. I followed up and on line got an email from Walgreens on Esperanza) that it was ready for pick up. I went in and was told they have no record of my ever submitting it (even though I resubmitted it again today).The Pharmacy tech/clerk said they can't fill the prescription because it ran out. I explained very carefully that I had submitted it over 3 weeks ago and again today along withe email they sent me that it was ready for pick up. She kept repeating they can't fill it because there were no more refills. I called my doctor's office and they said they got it today. I asked my doctor to try and switch it to the other Walgreens on Continental. I ran out of this prescription a week ago.; As a loyal customer of over a decade it's disappointing that my spouse and I now feel as though we are an inconvenience to a certain cashier. We have never been rude, intolerant or inappropriate yet certain staff members feel they can treat customers as an inconvenience.; This is a big drug store with almost everything you need.; I found out that many residents in Green Valley no longer drive. They walk to Walgreens for groceries. I looked around and the store has a nice variety of products. The staff are always friendly. I like coming here.; (UPDATE) Called for fill, was told will take additional 2 days as they are out of stock on that specific medication (shocker). This store is a joke and their hours are as well. Save yourself the time and fill in Tucson, the drive is long, but at least you’ll get your medication the day you request the refill.

I am not retired, nor am I even close to retirement, however this pharmacy absolutely cannot keep any stock of the only medication I need, and consistently is “Out of stock” each month when I refill. This causes a delay sometimes of up to 5 days, stretching over weekends and holidays which is not acceptable. While I understand the local traffic is high during our peak months, I have a hard time believing that there are that many retirees on a dopamatic antagonist medication. I appreciate the staff and pharmacist, as they are just employed here, and have always been helpful and friendly but whomever is in charge of medication stock and consistency of recurring refills needs help.

Unfortunately, my prescribing physician’s office cannot locate the one on Duval Mine Rd, so I am forced to fill here, and wait for my medication while it is “on order” spanning 6 days from request to fill.

TL;DR
If you aren’t 78 years old, or actively retired, your prescriptions will LITERALLY never be filled on time, regardless of using the Walgreens app or calling in, and the medication I am prescribed is out of stock Every. Single. Month. Not acceptable, in any fashion."

Hidden 💎; I can say enough good things about this store.

Ive livd in the area for 3 years and a big part of what has kept me here is this corner store. Being able to walk down and get some essentials is so peaceful and meaningful to me.

Their staff is kind and helpful and just good people. The owner is a great guy and if you ask him to stock stuff for you he will do his best to get it for you.

I used to always drink flax milk and asked if he’d carry it for me, he did! And I was so grateful for that!

You definitely should buy all your booze and other snacks for this shop. They have a deli and great sandwiches too!; This is our corner store and we LOVE it! Bob, the owner is the nicest down to earth guy. It took me almost a year but I finally convinced him to put diet Dr pepper in the fountain😄I was so happy. The food in the deli is great, store is ALWAYS clean and stocked (except when I buy out all the Swedish fish lol), and Bob plus staff are so friendly and helpful. They are also proactive with keeping themselves and the public safe with dividers at the registers, masks etc. I saw some crazy jerk left a bad review accusing them of not wearing masks, but I can attest that they wear masks and are behind a divider. The next step would be an isolation pod. Give it a rest. I go there every day sometimes more than once and have never seen any of them do ANYTHING that would be harmful to themselves or the customers. So stop in there and check it out. They are awesome! (No I don't work here. Just a very loyal customer!); Firstly they have awesome pricing, I always expect a huge mark up at places like this, but everything is very reasonable. The staff are super friendly and helpful.

The little deli inside has great food! They exclusively serve boars head. Prices for the deli are a smidge steep, but they make up for it by not skimping on the fillings.; Live right next door so it’s super convenient. They have a very good selection of craft beer and a wine section that could compete with a full size grocery store. They have everything you could need. The owners are very friendly and are constantly trying to improve the store. They are about to introduce a deli which is exciting. Come support your local convenience store !"

Expect to be there for a long time with seemingly no explanation. This is every single time not just once in a while. Pick another pharmacy for your own sanity.; My last visit with Walgreens was excellent.    I didn't realize I had a discount coming that was associated with my phone number because I haven't used them for awhile.

I appreciated the discount and the customer service.     I didn't take photos because I was in a hurry.; I don’t know how it’s possible for every time I come to pick up a prescription there are six or seven cars in the drive-through lane all waiting 10 to 15 minutes for someone inside to literally “hand a bag” to a car.  This place is absolutely pathetic. I keep telling my wife to change over to CVS but this is 50 feet closer drive time. DO BETTER WALGREENS; This is the worst pharmacy ever. I don’t even know what else to say. Fill your prescriptions somewhere else.; This is worst pharmacy have ever experienced, at 64yrs old have experienced a few. Went 5mins til close & they refused to help cuz my prescription wasn't ready even though called earlier in day to verify it was. Then said it was returned to stock even tho it was filled just 3 days prior. It was an Inhaler which needed right away. The pharmacist told me he had young kids & needed to get home to them, this is 10pm. Have no co-pays so didn't need to ring it up. This return to stock or prescription isn't ready thing has happened almost every time get med refilled. Had to drive much further to 24hr location & wait over an hr. When call put on hold 10-15 mins & then get hung up on. Yesterday was hung up on 3 times, took 25 mins to talk to someone to see if med was ready that Dr sent refill for. Was told they didn't have a refill order. Today called to see if my prescription had been sent by Dr & they said no. Called my Dr's office & they said had sent yesterday. Called another Walgreens & they said it was ready at this location. You'll get robo calls that your prescription should be refilled but no calls once it has. They are rude & never apologize for their mistakes, just get more hostile like I'm the one responsible. Stay away from this Walgreens!"

I have some meds that can be out of stock sometimes.  This pharmacy continues to be so kind and patient.

She was just so helpful, knowledgeable, and very, very patient.

Jahira is an asset to the company and deserves any additional accolades Walgreens can muster up.

Good customer service is hard to come by and she is indeed a GEM.; Pharmacy customer service is absolute trash! In person it's ""ok"". But God forbid you call! They won't even answer and ask you to hold, they will either hang up on you continuously, or constantly pick up and immediately place you on hold! I've been calling/sitting on hold for half an hour now with them periodically repeating the same actions. I wonder if this is what they are taught to do during training to bridge the last half hour or so of their shift. Does Corporate approve of this behavior??"

They store is always dirty and disorganized now. I do store pick up to avoid going into the store and even then they can’t get that right. I’m usually missing an item or two and they take so long to even bring your order to the car. I marked that I arrived at 2:15 and did not receive my items until til 2:40. Please hire more staff and more competent staff.; I've shopped at Target for years and this location is solidly in the middle--neither excellent nor horrible.

I'm eagerly awaiting this location to get the same makeover you've seen at more-current Targets--The addition of Ulta, etc. The older Targets like this one, now feel extremely retro in comparison. Your guess is as good as mine if this location will be fortunate enough to qualify for the upgrade.

At certain times, especially towards the end of the day, you will need to use self-checkout, as there aren't many cashiers available. This is not too bad if you don't have many items, but it can be difficult to balance multiple items on the self-checkout weight checker.

The service at Starbucks is often not the best, but I'm not sure how much of that is due to this specific location or if it's an issue with Starbucks in general.

Overall, it's okay, but you might want to consider going to one of the newer Target locations.; I went into Starbucks today and the girl attending me , Alexa was her name!

Lower the price is a tad instead of paying forty two dollars for vitamins. Which is really extreme.. Can they make it fifteen or twenty??? I get people want make purchases Spending 100 or 115.00 For a few items, especially on vitamins, little excessive.
I do actually like the people in the building.They're very kand some of them , the oriental lady Likes getting incentives And sometimes that girl can Needs A bonus that also goes for..

No complaints about actual pharmacy , but they can actually teach out some of these people or Store's How to treat other people not complaining just suggesting;)!!;) And as for the price drop that would be a big Big big big benefitHugeBig BENEFIT!!! BIg BENEFIT!!  Exam.

I’m extremely frustrated with my experience at Walgreens. I take a controlled substance that I rely on, and it’s known to be in short supply. My psychologist and I have worked to stay ahead of this by ensuring my prescription can be filled with either the generic or regular version. I called Walgreens earlier today after they mentioned an issue with my insurance, and they assured me it would be ready this evening.

When I arrived to pick it up, they told me it wasn’t ready. I returned before closing, only to be told they didn’t have it in stock at all and would need to order it, with an expected arrival on the 11th. This is absolutely unacceptable. Why didn’t anyone inform me of this when I called at 3 PM? Had I known, I could have asked my doctor to send the prescription to another pharmacy that could fill it.

I’m now left without my medication, and I hate the fact that I rely on it to function. Walgreens doesn’t seem to understand the kind of relapse I experience when I don’t have it—it’s truly unbearable. The lack of professionalism was evident, and I’m deeply disappointed. Walgreens, if you don’t have the medication, please let us know upfront so we can make other arrangements. Now I’m left scrambling, hoping and praying that another pharmacy can help me tomorrow.; Hi, I had to share an absolutely wonderful experience I had yesterday! I just got out of the hospital and had some pretty expensive prescriptions. The amazing woman behind the counter, Gracie, found a cheaper price for me than my insurance was. She saved me about $50 and was just awesome! Then the awesome pharmacist, Luu, noticed some of the meds had pretty specific instructions. He made sure that I was well informed and really helped me out! Both Gracie and Luu were incredible, knowledgeable, and kind and I recommend them wholeheartedly! They should probably even get a raise for being sooooo awesome!!!!!💜🙏🫶🤟💜🙏🫶🤟💜🙏🫶🤟; Most “Woke” Walgreens I have ever seen. Nothing but a bunch of mask wearing rude employees. One of the female employees was literally blocking my path and I said excuse me and she just stood there like a brain dead zombie, staring at me with a mask on and then says “Did you need to get by?” Wow, just wow. They also don’t know how to make a proper path to the cash register, you literally have to walk towards the back of the register area or walk towards the front of the store which makes them think you’re going to walk out with the items.; I had been trying to fill my prescriptions here and I kept being told I owed significantly more than my insurance company confirmed I should pay since my deductible had been nearly been met.  In fact, I was told by Walgreens my deductible was twice the amount on my card and in my policy.  Finally, my insurance company figured out that Walgreens incorrectly input my name, relationship code to the policy holder and other items when I was originally put into their system, therefore Walgreens never applied my previous out of pocket payments on prescriptions to my deductible.  After a week and a half of trying to get my prescription filled and on day 2 without my medication, my insurance company called this Walgreens with me on the phone, as well.  The person we spoke with was angry, he acted completely annoyed to deal with this, and he kept arguing with the insurance company that I had not met my deductible despite her telling him repeatedly that I had.  He then ""accidentally"" disconnected the phone call.  The woman from my insurance company was appalled by his treatment of me, and the incompetence and lack of any desire to try to fix the situation.  I am transferring my prescription to another pharmacy and will never again do business with this Walgreens.; 5 Stars to a seriously overworked team.

Every person there was putting out 150% to fill orders, answer the phone and  be friendly and helpful to the folks waiting to check out.  I didn't feel good about what I saw and neither should Walgreens management.  Lets just remember that what people in a pharmacy do is important and mistakes can have terrible results.  These people need some help."

I have been waiting for this photo cube for the past 4 days. Two previous managers there had stated that no one has been trained and they do not put priority to the photo dept therefore it would be ready the next day. As mentioned I have waited 4 days for this photo cube for Yolanda to then tell me they do not make those in store and they get shipped instead and I could go to a different store to have those made. She mentioned this very rudely. It does not state online that this is the case that I could get it shipped to me. The two previous managers mentioned it could be made and that due to lack of training in the photo department it had not been made.; Not only is this the dirtiest walgreens you will ever visit. They are also not good at filling a prescription with the correct insurance. My last prescription i was told my insurance didnt cover all of it so I downloaded the good RX app and paid the discounted price. Today when they told me my prescription was not covered by my insurance at all I asked to verify which insurance they had on file. They had some completely made up insurance that she claimed was from my last employer. I've never had employer sponsored healthcare. It turns out that my insurance did cover all of my prescriptions this entire time.

They look horrible with breast and a lot of facial hair and the shaved head. I really don't think they should not look that horrible.
I stopped in on our way home and wanted to buy stuff but forget it. Went to tell the manager how unprofessional that person was but guess manager is gone.

Literally every single time. Just a couple examples, one time I went in for cold medicine I think it was well the Walgreens app had coupons on it for the items I was purchasing, well their system was not processing the coupons for some reason, they were adamant that there was nothing they could do about it. I even asked for a manager and said you can see the coupon on my app and that it is legit can’t you just honor it? She said again nothing she could do I would have to call corporate as people have been having issues with the app. Second time I went in and there was a posted discount for an item I purchased and again their system was coming up with it as regular price I said well you have a sign back there that shows this sign, the cashier even went and looked and said oh that’s weird but again refused to honor it!! So since your system or your workers don’t do their jobs by making sure the item is marked as sale in your system you won’t honor what the clear sign says?!?

I will no longer shop there and I know this probably means nothing to them but hopefully this helps save future customers a headache.; In the year and a half I have lived in the neighborhood and been going to this location, I have had more problems with my prescriptions and their lack of communication on Walgreens part. At first, I thought it was the Pharmacy department now I am realizing it is the whole dang store. I was just rudely greeted by a manager who instead of trying to fix the problem spoke over me and made it sound like I was the one creating the problem. I would highly recommend going to a different pharmacy. GET IT TOGETHER, WALGREENS.; If I could give zero stars I would...I was at this location the other day to buy some cold medicine and leave. I felt like going in my pjs because it was going to be a quick trip but apparently that was my first major mistake because almost immediately I started being followed by 2 employees as I walked across the store. Then as I proceeded to check out they were both standing behind me starring at me (but pretending not to stare at me and ""work""). I felt so uncomfortable, I didn't realize you need to look a certain way in order to not be discriminated and followed when visiting this store. Maybe if the staff actually did their jobs there wouldn't be empty shelves and more customers like another reviewer mentioned.; This Walgreens is awesome!!!!!!

I left bc my attitude is just as bad as hers, and I'm not gonna a let it come out this early.
Hope she loses the plate to her microwave.; My experience at this store was not good at all, instead of asking me for help they followed me around the whole store Made me feel uncomfortable  and so I just put my items down and walked out. I'm not sure if it was because the color of my skin or the way that I was dressed but all I wanted was a couple of items of makeup for my daughter and I couldn't even get it Because I felt so uncomfortable. They also made it very noticeable that I was being watched and they whispered amongst themselves while Eyeing me which is definitely not A good form of customer service. Even one staff member came right behind me and snatched an item off the shelf and when I told her I apologize for not putting it back in the correct place she ignored me, gave me an evil look and walked off.I probably won't be going back to that store unless They have a new staff or at a different time when it's a shift change.; I just want to shout out to the cashier and manager that were there today 07/22 at 9:59 pm.

The pharmacist Dr. Bereket, and the  pharmacy technicians Richard and Joe truly went above and beyond to help me and make everything right after a long day! I cannot thank them or sing their praises enough. This was the 3rd pharmacy I had been contacted over the course of the day and they were the first ones to truly be able and won't to take the time to help me out.; Absolutely do not try and fill your prescriptions here!!!

Absolutely ridiculous!!! After I pick up my prescriptions tomorrow I will not be using CVS whatsoever to fill my prescriptions I'll takenmy business elsewhere!!! I'm really glad I just called because my prescriptions were supposed to be ready days ago and today is the first day that I've been able to feel good enough to go out and they don't have them ready and supposedly they're going to have both of them ready tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. which is absolutely insane!!! Your pharmacy is literally open 24 hours a day!!! And I know I'm not the only one because every time I'm in there somebody else is having an issue with them too!!!!; Antonio who helped me out in the Photo Department tonight passes the ninja processing vibe test!! Super personable, photo book turned out amazing making me look like the best daughter in law what what too!!! Website quoted middle of the night time frame and he processed it asap! TY Walgreens for offering late photo printing options too!!!; Changed to this pharmacy 2 months ago and I do not recommend. I will be changing back to the previous Walgreens location I went to.
The first Rx I had filled I was shorted 30 pills of a controlled medication. I was able to pick the missing medication up after speaking to the pharmacist but this was really concerning.

I wish I had the woman’s name that I have spoken with over the phone a few times when calling the pharmacy. She is very rude and short every time I’ve spoken to her. I asked a question about their store’s policy (because they all have different policies) and I wanted to make sure that my meds would be available and in stock to pick up when it was due and so that I was not out of my medication just like any of my other routine meds. I was shut down and told they would not fill early. That’s not what I ever asked. I simply asked if they would have in stock so I could pick up on the date that they are able to fill. I don’t think that’s unreasonable. If they only refill 1 day prior (Day #29) and that happens to fall on a Saturday or a Sunday and are out of stock - you will have to wait several more days for them to order your medication and have it filled. I told her that I was trying to avoid a delay or being without my meds as there was a time my meds were due on a Friday but because they didn’t have in stock on Thursday and didn’t submit the order in time … AND it was a 3 day weekend, I had to wait 5 days before they would have in stock so I was out of my meds for 4 days. She had the audacity to argue with me and tell me that wasn’t possible, that never happened, and the only reason there would have been a delay is if there was a manufacturing problem. Seriously? Why are you even arguing with me about this???

Avoid this Walgreens.; I would give 0 stars if it were allowed.  The customer service from the pharmacy is a joke.  They have no customer service skills what so ever.  I was simply calling in ahead to request an additional bottle for my script. I was on for 8 min before deciding to just go to the pharmacy and the call transferred to my car.   I am currently on hold going on 22 min now(still holding) . The call has rang through the hold 7 times now, and each time nobody says anything,  they simply answer and go right back to hold.  Not a please continue to hold (answered and back to hold again) not a bite me,  NOTHING! So frustrating.
Still on hold 30 min later
By the time I got to the drive-thru window, there was one guy very polite working the window and the whole Pharmacy was full of girls standing around and giggling and waving and chit-chatting to each other not working."

However, I don't agree how the owners treat their employees, and would rather shop somewhere else, but unfortunately it is the only reasonably priced option where I live. That is why the rating is not higher; I love the grocery pick up and delivery services! Always friendly and efficient! Saves me so much time every week!

My card was not working so I was forced to use another which didn't have the right amount to cover the transaction.
Julian was the cashier and he was so encouraging and patient. He helped me get the total to the right price and even chipped in to cover the change I couldn't cover. I hope that doesn't get him in trouble, because this review is a shout out to him and the way he treated me. It's so nice to see a young generation be so caring. He truly made my whole night better.; My husband got disorientated going to our car after shopping.  Not sure where he had parked.  It was shortly thereafter that staff from Walmart came to his aid.  They were concerned for his welfare and were going to take the time to help him.  A staff member found me, told me what happened and suggested I make sure he got water.  We both have nothing but the highest praise for these employees who put the welfare of a customer at the top of their concerns.; The floors were a little dingy. The produce department was very impressive. The ACC department and garage area were well taken care of. The gentleman who was working freight inside was awesome. I believe his badge stated TL Dakota.

However, to I interacted with a guy that was very rude. I just needed to pick up some prescriptions. I am very flexible on picking up prescriptions, if the Rx isn't ready, I just want to know what's going on and get any problems fixed. Today, one Rx wasn't ready despite me getting multiple texts saying it was. The guy tried to tell me Rx wasn't covered by my insurance (it is) and was very snippy and rude. I didn't care that it wasn't ready, I would have come back, but I needed to make sure that it would be filled and covered. I ended up needing to go in (an ex was too big for the drive through drawer). When inside the snippiness continued and he rudely explained that it had been put back (ok no problem, I just requested it be filled again - no hurry). Inside I was horrified by the toy they had on display at the register. They had a rubber duck in the style of Donald Trump with a bandage on its ear. I don't care what your political views are glorifying political violence in a setting such as Walmart is not acceptable. I don't mind people being proud of their political views, whatever they may be, (though I don't think it is very professional at a business like Walmart) but displaying something that highlights political violence is sickening. Do better Walmart. I am going to look into taking my prescriptions elsewhere because I don't need to deal with someone who is rude just to pick up necessary medication. It's sad because I have had such great experiences with this pharmacy before, but this guy ruined it.; Employees are rude. Asked for help getting water off top shelf and three employees walked away not helping. One male employee with long black hair balding with beard gave me a stupid smile and walked away. A 4th employee helped me. All self check out rows were closed except last row and people were waiting. Never will go back to this store again and hope they close allowing a store to open were employees that are nice helping old people.; This Walmart store is undoubtedly one of the cleanest I've ever been to in my 30 years of living. The representatives were extremely friendly and truly went above and beyond to assist me. 😍; Today my boyfriend and I were shopping and we had a Caucasian dude followed us in what looked like he was taking a pic or video . As we checked out no one said hi or good afternoon but some worker came up behind my boyfriend who is ""Blk"" and grabbed a plastic bag he put down. It was very rude and felt unwelcome like they don't like ""blk"" men secretly. We are confused because this just happened to me this passed Friday. Some Asian worker there came up behind me and was 2 "" from me stood up behind me looking at my transaction and my boyfriend was behind him. I was so afraid I didn't turn around but I was then calm when I saw my boyfriend behind him. It seems like they treat us as if we are stealing something. We've been shopping here for a year not sure what the real issue is but we had enough. Not going silent anymore.; Thrift store is pretty decent would be nice if their mobility scooters would have more and we'll all be working but other than that it's a nice store to shop at the the staff seems to be very nice"

I’ve worked at Walgreens and the items close to expiration should be pulled from the shelves BEFORE they expire. Not left for customers to buy.; I went in for a Coke Zero and three employees were at the front gossiping about other customers. They all looked me right in the face and did not greet me, just kept speaking poorly on a customer.

I grabbed my Coke Zero and walked up to the register and the three started talking about breaks and who gets to take one. The cashier was screaming the entire transaction that she hadn’t taken a break yet. It actually hurt my ears, her voice sounded like she has smoked for as many hundreds of years as she’s been alive.

She did not make eye contact with me the entire time I was checking out and kept screaming while holding my receipt up. Am I in NYC? How is this behavior appropriate? It’s time for basic customer training again me thinks. I should not have had to have my ears ringing just to get a Coke Zero.; The cashier at the front Michael was rude unprofessional and and harassed my daughter about her ID when I was buying a bottle of wine she is 15 she doesn’t have one he was just very unprofessional over all and should not work in customer service!; I understand they the pharmacy has reduced hours, but when I went I not was closed any there was no sign stating when it reopened.  But asked at the front and the rude young man barked - “there’s a sign, it’s 2:00”.  I went back and checked again and another store employee asked if they could help me, I stated I was looking for a sign with pharmacy hours because the young man had been rude about it.  The employee couldn’t find a sign either.  Unfortunately, rudeness is very common among their employees (not the pharmacy employees).  Last time the cashier ripped my debit card out of my hand and swiped it - it wasn’t working for her either."

I said don't worry I won't because I won't be coming back here again after shopping here for the last 16 years and she said GOOD! Just so you know!! Wow!!!; The pharmacy here has PROMPTLY to filled rxs just phoned in by Drs offices several times. I don't drive, so I really appreciate that they expedite these fills while friends wait for me. I love that a Pharmacist speaks to you regarding every prescription, too! Pharmacy techs here are all professional and kind as well. Glad THIS is MY PHARMACY! Thank you all!; First time seeing the new reno....Nice inside with a great selection.
The gals in the pharmacy are awesome and very personable.; This is the worst Walmart I have ever been to. I have never been so disrespected in my shopping experience. Publicly humilated and treated like some third grade animal. Thier staff degraded me like I was a terrorist. I will never set foot in that store again.; The Walmart team here is very friendly with a good attitude and very helpful They seem to be happy and take pride in helping others find what they need."

There is a strong smell of cigarette smoke in this establishment but that's okay, they have an excellent selection of beer, and smoke products. Patty (or Pattie?) helped me out with a Drekker PB&J which was very nice of her, and she helped me find one other flavor to try out.

She mentioned she would order anything in that you would want, so if there's a particular beer you're looking for, Beer World appears to want to help you obtain it. That's nice, I've never had a local place to go to that would order me in something if I wanted something different that wasn't available in the area, not sure on the pricing on that, but it appears to be a featured offered.

Pretty neat place, oh and they have a drive-thru!; This place doesn't look like much. As a matter of fact, I would have drove past it and went to QT if not for a friend's recommendation. Don't let that happen to you, it's a hidden gem! The owner mans the counter himself. They guy is knowledgeable, funny, and friendly. Visit a few times and he will remember your usual order or your craft tastes and recommend something for you. He has the standard domestics plus a nice selection of craft brews from which you can build your own six pack and sample. Overwhelmed by choices or not sure where to start? Just ask him, he knows his inventory and is happy to help. Even if you think you don't need help, listen up- he has good suggestions. Prices are average. You can save a few cents by recycling your old cardboard 6-pk carriers.; I love this place. They’re so interpersonal and work to get to know their customers. Just amazing customer service and connections. My husband and I visit often to try out something new and it’s always so positive. I brought my dad and he loved it as well. I can’t rave about this place enough. As an introvert who doesn’t like the crowding of bars, the level of social interaction and variety is so ideal for me. One of my favorite local businesses.; This place is has a great selection of Beer but I go there for the selection of Hemp Wraps that I can’t find anywhere else!; Edit 2021: beer world was my favorite spot but they were bought out and now they only sell basic beer. If you're looking for everything you can find at Circle K, then this is your spot. It's not the cool craft beer store it once was.

Original review: Beer World is a gem in Mesa! Tons of craft options and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. I'm happy I found such a cool spot!"

Not only is that ridiculous but it's illegal unless they have a sign posted in the store stating they don't accept coins or certain methods of payments. They told my husband not to come back. No problem. We never will.; Fantastic local shop with friendly service and great little selection of food staples in a relative grocery desert.  This place has saved me a few times when I needed to grab a couple ingredients but didn't want to drive to the grocery store.

Don’t come here if you are looking for efficiency from the the drive up crew.; I usually love Target, but AVOID this location. The store is small and a lot of basic products are now locked in glass cages. There are never representatives available to unlock them. I waited 15 minutes and wandered around the store for another 10 trying to find someone before giving up. They also frequently change what they do and do not sell in the store and most of the time are low stocked on the items that are “available” so I never am able to check everything off my list. It’s worth the additional drive to go to the Target off 44th St, or even a competitor closer.; my review probably won’t matter to most, i needed to use the bathroom and i had my 12moth old baby with me and no one else. to pit in perspective i couldn’t wait any longer to use the bathroom.  first they had to call someone else to open the family bathroom ( witch is fine) but it took 10 ‘minutes for someone to show up all for them just to tell me i can’t take the cart with my baby in it in with me. my baby can’t walk, and  i didn’t want him on the floor or out in the hallway alone i was willing to put my stuff back that i had in my cart but he told me it didn’t matter and it was apart of there “policy” i was polite  i wasn’t rude or a “karen” but he wasn’t giving me any other solutions other then holding in my uncontrollable bodily functions or going somewhere else. HE was rude and unconsiderate of the fact that i was alone with my baby and needed to use a restroom. even if this is the policy or he was lying to my face about the policy something needs to change i expect more from customer service job for mothers who are alone. this would’ve have been that big of a deal if he just left me use the restroom instead i got stressed out and cried in the middle of target thanks; Was sold a video game that did not have the correct disc in the case. Immediately came back to the store to correct the error but was accused of swapping the disc & they refused to make it right. So now I’m out of $75 because obviously one of their employees accepted a return that they shouldn’t have.; One of the smaller Target stores, with a compact, yet sufficient selection of groceries, tech and clothing. A very small selection of books. Oh, and the shelves are almost empty of sales products. (I am being told that it is not unusual.) The place to find all GCU students."

Never have I shopped at a Walgreens where I didn't find at least one -if not all- of the cashier and floor management to be brusque or oblique or indescribably rude or sub-rosa disdainful of people in general. Occasionally, there comes a weirdo or a pleasant odd bird, but not today.

They are the reason why I prefer Walgreens. God bless them and I wish them all the success. ❤️

Its a confusing layout to other walgreens i have been to.  The pharmacy is adequate. It is quite security conscious due to the area. I would not feel too safe going alone there despite parking lot at entrance being well-lit in the pm and a busy cross-street. Please check pharmacy hours. For the most part they shut at 6pm.

I went back to see if they can reprint it. The guy I talked to with a long striped colored hair stated that I have to reorder it and they will print it out. It sounds so inconvenient to do that especially if you picked out 60 photos to be printed. He seem like he did not want to do some little order research to just get it printed out. Just plain out lazy. I do not like individuals, who can not do their job. I ask someone else by the name of ""Star"", who got it done right away without having to tell me to reorder it and she said she can do it with no problem.

Bought a bunch of their Xmas present items. Had to return 2 of them because they were so cheaply made they didn't even work. Tried the big dill pickle. Almost thru up. Food is supposed to taste good not bad. Why do places sell food that no one would eat? I just don't get that? And why do they only make one check out person ring everyone up? They never have two check out person's working no matter how long the line is. It's like they could care less if you buy something in their stores. They just don't seem to care. And I go regularly to get my refill medication and it's  always like this. It never changes; I had to get two prescriptions filled for my dog. I came here around 7 o'clock at night. I was glad the pharmacy was still open at that time of the evening.

The young pharmacy tech who helped me was very nice. He helped me with the Good Rx coupons. The other guy made sure I understood the directions for giving the  pills to my dog.

I didn't have to wait long at all to receive have the prescriptions filled.; My father and I went to buy walgreen's severe cold and flu that stated at the price of ""8.99"" on the price tag ticket. When we  purchase the product, the price on the receipt said 11.99. With tax, it was a total up to nearly 13-14 dollars. If the medicine cost 11.99, please put it at 11.99, not 8.99. And some lady with short hair and a guy that works at the register told my dad if there was difference in pricing, we should tell them before purchasing. How should he know that ? Does my dad even work there ? GEE Why should it be a customer responsibility to tell an employee at walgreens ""what the pricing was before purchasing?"" We only knew it was 11.99 after the purchase not before it. If the price ticket on the shelf said 11.99 instead of 8.99, this would not be a problem. To add, the cashier stated he could not refund and it was only ""exchanged or store credit"". It took the manager to give us our money back for a good 15-30 minutes. The manager seem to be the only one to show genuine sympathy and apologize to us while the other lady was frustrated about the situation. Walgreen should check their employee's for being incompetent, their lack of communication skills, and their incorrect prices."

And the workers tend to be a bit demanding when it comes to checking out i.e. self-checkout; I usually use the delivery service via Walmart plus  the lack of care is getting out of control the orders are always late by hours and the food is never fresh or quality they’re so careless  truly shocked by the lack of care I was refused a refund and told it didn’t matter if the order was late or food was fresh because it was received?!

I felt as if they wanted to help me and not that I was intruding in their workday.  Great Customer Service!; Do not use same day delivery from this store.

** Update- found out a driver signed up for our order at 5 p.m. and held it for 2.5 hours before deciding they couldn't do it.  Needless to say I was at Target (for the last time) at 9:30 p.m. and never going back.

Costco makes you scan your membership card before you enter now, so I’ll be shopping even more at Sam’s Club. Great job to everyone. Keep it up.; Great location however, the loading docks are a mess! The staff back there have an attitude problem. We were there an hour before our appointment and told that we couldn't dock, eventhough all the docks were empty. We were also told that we could not come inside to use the restroom until our appointment time. Off loading took two hours!  The restroom was one of the most disgusting I've ever run across!

I really appreciate them!; Every time I’ve been into this location to shop, it’s always been some sort of issue with pricing, understaffing, cashiers and managers not qualified apparently to find my shopper card on file, or even fix the issue. Today was despicable. A lot of sale prices and clearance pricing on cosmetics. But Walgreens doesn’t like to honor their sale prices once you get to the checkout. Your manager on duty was a real piece of work. He basically argues with me about the discrepancy in pricing saying , “ a customer probably put the wrong product in the this area”, lol. Basically saying the customer is the problem- not him, not your regionals, not anyone else but the customer. He refused to honor the sale price on any of my cosmetic items, was very smirky and disrespectful. I just left all your products there. Never to return, and continue shopping  at CVS. I hope Walgreens goes out of business. The worst!; The services in the farmacy is horrible, every time that I am trying to refill a prescription they can't find the prescriptions for my son, my son takes controled medication and he is insulin depending, and I have to go several times, and to call the doctor to confirm if the prescription was sent, until finally they go through all my son prescription and find them, is like they are no willing to search and check for it. Then when finally found it, they said to me come back tomorrow. I went today after days trying a refill a prescription the farmacist was assisted other client and when finally another employee appears she told me sorry we are close, I look at my clock it was 7 pm o'clock I was there before 7, and she said sorry we actually closed, i tried to tell her that i was there and the other guy was attending a client and I heard all the instructions for their medication, and I  only want to pick up a prescription that is ready. My son has been missing his controlled medication now for days because his carelles in attention and actitud, they really don't care about the people they attending and the emergency of them.
The cashiers at front are nice this is only good about this place..; Every time I go in there the cashiers are rude to me! The only helpful person is the women who works in cosmetics. I shop here often and it’s ridiculous that I’m treated the way that I am. I can’t help but feel it’s due to the color of my skin. On multiple occasions the cashiers (older caucasian women)that ring me out do not say one word to me. They’ve ignored me when I’ve said hello. I’ve literally seen them chatting it up and laughing with costumes ahead of me (Caucasian women and men) today the cashier Ignored me as usual and I said hello twice. She asked for my ID and I said well hello there you are and she ignored me and continued to scan my items and bag two of my glass items together carelessly. I will not be shopping here anymore!; We are regulars at this location and are generally happy with the promptness of preparing prescriptions, the automated communication updates and variety of items available on location. The hours are convenient. The store is kept clean and well organized and the staff is friendly and helpful.  Please click 👍 if this was helpful."

No help on the floor. But the very worst is their cafe, so little people in line and about 5 people in the back serving. They still can’t get their grape out of their backend. Kept giving my order away to whom ever came up. They just said oops let me get you another, we’ll it only took 3 times to get 2 hot dogs and a pretzel. The only plus side that yeah it’s cheaper than eating some other fast food places.; Ruth really made the mistake to treat customers like trash today. It was really busy because it was lunch time, she was treating everyone with an attitude, and then when it was finally my turn, I asked her for a pizza pretzel, and before saying anything else, she made this annoyed weird face with anger, and said no because it’s a 30 min wait (which is pretty normal for this location, usually 20-30 mins). I told her I could wait, and she still hesitated and suggested that I don’t. Anyways, she finally put in the order. Charged us. No big deal. Understood that it was busy. Moving on. 30 mins later, we get our order. Part of the order was wrong, but whatever, didn’t even bother to tell them. But, Because my pizza pretzel was hot I needed utensils, and there weren’t any knives on the dispenser for it. I go to the front again, and I asked for a knife, and she told me to find them in the dispenser, and I told her there weren’t any, and she kept saying that there were. I kept trying to explain to her that there weren’t any. And she kept fighting me to check again. I went, checked again, and nothing. So I go back, asked for a knife again, and she starts arguing with her co-workers and laughing that I keep saying that I keep claiming that there weren’t any knives. I stood there for about 2 mins waiting. And Ruth kept telling me to get the knife at the dispenser area, she said she was busy helping with orders. And once again, she told me to look in that area. I told her “M’am! I am not blind, can you please just get me a knife.” After rolling her eyes, and her co-worker telling me that I don’t need to have an attitude, even though it wasn’t, and simply was over begging them for a knife, the co-worker went to the dispenser area, and she realized that it  was stuck, so it took them a couple of minutes to fix it, they finally fixed it, didn’t say anything and just walked away. Overall, food tasted well, just the experience made it really bad, especially when I come here often. I understand that they were busy, there was no need for employees to treat their customers that way.; I always have a good experience at Sam's Club.  I much prefer over Costco for a number of reasons.  I've had both memberships at the same time and most recently chose to renew just my Sam's Club membership.  More locations available for me to shop although they closed the one closest to me.  I wish they had one in my city.  I always start with gas.  Most always the lowest price I can find most anywhere.  Using the gas application within their app for gas makes fueling up a breeze.  Very quick.  Food court is always good for the money if you need a quick bite.  Although they took away my favorite pizza (the supreme). Most everything is always in stock.  I love using the scan and go shopping tool on their app.  So nice not to have to wait in line to checkout and makes the exit process very efficient.  Products are always good quality and prices are very competitive.  They change a lot of products very often which is nice.  Keeps it fresh.  Service although minimal is always good.  I will definitely continue to renew my membership.  The value is definitely there.; Frankie in the meat department was very professional and helpful. I didn't see the grass fed grass finished striploin steak out on the floor. I mentioned it to him and he brought out an entire box full of what i needed. We took some time to appreciate the quality of the meat, it was a good time.; Sam's Club has so many different products for you to choose. They have also added a new convenient way to shop. You just shop, put your items in the cart and scan as you go. Once you are done, you just add your credit card information and away you go!! There will be a receipt that is on the app and it will show how many items there should be in your cart. The person that is standing by the out door will scan a few items in your cart to verify that they are on the receipt and away you go.
Scan & go is the way to go!! Oh did I mention that you get discounts on certain items when you use this app?? It saved me an additional $25!! I would recommend if you are going to Sam's Club that you do the scan & go!!"

That's why Costco is my only option.; Not impressed at all. Although they did have a few items that Costco doesn’t carry so this will be the only reason I come back. Thought I would give Sam’s Club a try as I have been a Costco customer for years. Glad I only paid half of the usual membership price due to their membership discount going on. Immediately when I walked in the store appeared unkempt and felt dirty. One person running a checkout whom was in training and the rest were all self checkouts. Thankfully it wasn’t busy. Employees not professional at all in appearance and or mannerisms. Some prices good and some not so good. Produce and meats not even comparable to Costco. Most looked like they were not fresh or day old. Unfortunately the quality is just not there. Not sure if I will be renewing my membership and so glad I did not pay more and go with the plus membership. If you are a Costco member I suggest you stay there. Costco has much better quality in produce and meats and Costco runs multiple sales where you get excellent discounts on products that are already decent in price. I didn’t see one item marked down from original prices. Very disappointing.; Sam’s Club really needs to take some notes from Costco. We have been so spoiled by Costco that anytime we go to Sam’s Club, it is a major letdown in terms of customer service. At this particular location, the café is a complete joke. If you look at the pictures, so many people are waiting for their food, but nobody was getting anything, including the people that had paid in advance with the app. After 15 or 20 minutes, someone finally asked where the food was. The guy behind the counter said, “If you tell me what you want, I will get it for you.” You read that correctly, he wasn’t going to send out any food unless people ask for it. People could have told him anything, and he would’ve handed it to them without seeing if it was really part of their order. This location gets worse and worse. They really need to train their cafe employees.; What is with all these people in Az. with all the black clothing on? Is this the color of death? to look 'tough'? to identify with the gang image? I don't get it, and I don't understand how this became a trend. Think it started in the early 90's with 'rap'/hip-hop crap..E-gawds..Robert at 69.; Store was nice,  clean,  good selection,   Sunday and very busy.  Got to the front and there was one cashier.     3 employees standing around the self check out while a huge line was behind the one cashier.   Come on Walmart this is insane."

Update: Received a follow-up response from Beverage Barn with same flippant attitude we got in the store. It was not for the pruchased raffle that happened 11/30. Poor customer service and responses.; Even though I moved away from this area for a while, I've come back and the people at Beverage Barn have welcomed me and they said my name as the were greeting me. Last night the lady said , ""Wow, its good to see you, haven't seen you in a long time. "" That makes people feel good and the workers at this place, it just comes out naturally for them.

I normally grab a couple 6 packs of Koppaberg for my fiance when I come. However everytime I need it I have to ask for it because it's not something that has a spot on the shelf for some reason. I was told they had 23 in stock when I asked this time, but when the girl went back there they were all reserved for a wedding. They have good taste 😅. My frustration comes because if they were all already purchased they should have been removed from inventory. When I asked the two girls at the counter why isn't it kept in stock, they just said he (assuming the owner) doesn't keep it, they only order it when people request it. However I've picked it up many times without having to special request it. If clearly this is something people are wanting why would you not keep it in stock.; The two females that was in there, How you gone speak when somebody come in after me but not say anything to me!

They're also selling 5-year-old beer that is supposed to be sold fresh. I see the owner has now replied claiming that that beer has been sold out for years that picture was taken in October 2020. Also I have absolutely no interest in telling him who I am because he's the rude person I mentioned in my initial post. Feel free to lie about when you sold that beer (if you ever even sold it) although I do have a feeling this made you take it out of the cooler.

Stop in and check them out. Very convenient to campus. Don't have to fight the strip traffic.

Still awesome!

Take your business elsewhere and buy a nice bottle at MSRP.; Nice staff, dealt with out of towners well. There was no social distancing or masks used by staff or enforced. Some of the issues I had were the results of state laws so I'm not knocking them for that, which the staff explained.

I hope they business goes to hell…….; 2 stars for the decent selection, taking into consideration the size of the place, and the staff, who was friendly.

I give the low rating based off of the fact that they price gouge. I understand the concept of consumerism and supply vs. demand, as well as the fact that I can go elsewhere, but this is to warn others to be wary.

I saw two different bottles of allocated bourbon that were easily twice the retail.  What's sad is that they know that someone will come in, either desperate or uneducated, and pay those prices.; University Liquors was very efficient, had a large selection, and the staff was super friendly.

All of the staff made me feel very welcome. I Visited on January 2nd.
I'll make sure to stop here again next time I'm in Maine :); Do NOT use this redemption center they legit throw peoples money away!  My husband went in yesterday to return bottles after having to waste a 1/2 hour he took bottles that the machine wouldn’t take to the employee who went through them and proceeded to throw away bottles that clearly have the 5 cent return on them because “ we don’t take them here” so instead of asking if he wanted them back to return elsewhere!  When my husband asked for them back he was told they were thrown away and taken to the dumpster There was atleast $5+ in returns how dare you think it’s okay to throw away other peoples money! Will never return to this location again it’s a waste of time and clearly money.; Went there to return my bottles. Didn’t like that his was self service. Since when do you go to return your bottles & cans you have to do the work yourself. Then why pay 2 -3 people to be there. If I wanted to do that I would have gone to Shaws. Just saying!; You have to really watch this place. You could do the machine and return your bottles but every bottle that you throw in that box don’t count it being counted because I counted how many one time that I threw in the bin and when I went up to the front to exchange my receipt for the money, counted 45 bottles the dude only counted 24 Kind of a rip off if you don’t count your bottles that you throw in the bin; Always liked coming to Damons until having to deal with this one lady. Idk what her issue is with people but generally when people have 10-15 bags of bottles they are not stored in a house and there may be a little dirt on them.

Crowlers batting %100; Steve's is one of my all time places to come to get alcohol! I truly believe that this store is a Madison staple. They have a vast selection of wines, and they also have a healthy selection of champagne/bubbly wine. I adore the fact they have a whole wall dedicated to tequila, which is my preferred hard alcohol. Steve's also has Sake! It's so hard to find sake at liquor stores. The people working here are amazing and nice!; Recommended! This is a great liquor store with an excellent collection. One of the reasons I like going here is because they have nice little placards that tell you about the wines. They're informative, and the owners tend to highlight wines that are good buys or interesting finds.; Great selection. NA and other options available!

Staff is fine, pharmacist Emily Nadler is HORRIBLE.  She is an awful representation of an otherwise decent brand.; Rude & incompetent pharmacist & staff.  They did not want to assist in transferring my prescriptions from Walgreens. I was told to find a different Pharmacy, then I was told it would take two weeks, then I was told it would take 72 hours. I called and prescriptions were not filled. I called after 2 weeks and they said the transfer was complete and asked me if I wanted them filled. I thought that was the point of getting them transferred. They said it would take two days to fill them. I went in to pick them up and they double filled one prescription and failed to fill three of them. I called to ask why they didn't fill the other three prescriptions and was scolded by staff. The woman said she had to restock all of my prescriptions and I should have picked them up sooner. I explained that the prescriptions were not filled and each time I called they said they were not filled. She blamed me for their incompetence. The pharmacy did not have my correct phone number which may have led to the complications. The staff is extremely rude and unfortunately the pharmacist is the pharmacy manager and the store manager has limited hours and capabilities. I was told to file my complaints with corporate because they would not be addressed at the store level. I had to transfer all my prescriptions to another CVS location.; There were three of us in line waiting. Four ladies talking about their ages and laughing while we stood there waiting. The gentleman in the front had been standing for 20 minutes while two people answered phones and one stayed at the window just waiting for cars to come.; My daughter needed her medicine. They told me it would be about an hour until it’s done. Luckily, my husband looked online at their portal, and found that it is out of stock and won’t be able to fill it until tomorrow at 6pm at the earliest. I tried calling to see about switching it to another location and was on the phone for 57 minutes!! That is absolutely unacceptable. To make matters worse, at about 12 minutes, a lady picked up the phone, and after me saying hello, she said hello and then told me to “hold on just a minute.” This location does not have good customer service, and they are always behind. It is difficult to get ahold of anyone to talk to them. I understand that they could be under staffed, but there has to be some solution to this problem. It has been going on for more years than before covid.; Thank you to my CVS Pharmacy Staff at store# 7660 in Phoenix, AZ.

Unfortunately after many years there I will be switching locations.; No one wants to work the counter register and you are forced to use self check out. Pharmacy people are good. But the parking lot and landscape looks awful. Almost looks condemned out there. CVS also has huge markup on most items. Mainly I go here for my meds; To be honest, I'm really tired of all these companies having automated voicemails or answering for the pharmacy. It can't answer any of the questions that I have and for that reason I'm super disappointed. You should have more jobs CVS.. I think your customer service would be better then; Here to grab meds, came in to find out that they decided on their own to forward the medications to a different location. Now waiting so far 23mins to get it here and filled.

While waiting the ""pharmacist for the day"", Mal a snotty lady, was told they made an error on medication. She was rude and very adamant that the lady was wrong, she needed to run it back to her insurance, because it wasn't them .. well it was them, they charged her for 3 months supply, and gave her 30 days supply, and she had to give her a refund and rerun it.

I witnessed tour outwardly reprimanded colleague because a lady named Sharon said to do things one way, but she shut her down and told her ""don't ever say Sharon said something when IM here, I'm the one who's in charge and what I say goes"".... She absolutely needs more training and customer service, but also communication. I understand having the title of being in charge, but to act like a total ignorant oppressive monster is not okay.; CVS membership owner and go to this location about once a week because it's right next door.  The store itself is fine, some employees are super friendly and others really arent.  While not in the best of areas, it could be far worse.. so I don't fully understand the vibes of disdain for the job I get from a few of the staff members.  I've had bad luck with calling the pharmacy multiple times of the day on several occasions.  Store is clean and usually stocked with whatever I'm looking for.  Be prepared to be asked for money from boozers outside once in a while."

The daytime manager and front store clerk are always helpful and pleasant.; (REPORT THEM) worst experience with this location. Not only did I have poor customer service I also was accused of being a thief. I was shopping with my mom for her vitamins and dental floss. My mom needed assistance by the vitamins and pushed the button. We waited for 10 min and the manager finally came to help after the other associate called over the intercom for security to check the aisle for thieves. So when the store manager comes up to us to get the vitamins out the lock box she turns to my mom and says it will be at the front. We don't argue we walk to the front thinking nothing of it. I try to check out at the kiosk and my mom at the register with another associate who couldn't locate my mom's number. So she creates a new account. My mom asked the manager why she didn't give the vitamins to the associate and the manager said she didn't have time for thieves. Which we were paying for the things. She told us she didn't need to deal with us or any attitude and kicked us out. We asked for corporate number and she refused so I asked her if it's normal practice to deny providing corporate number which is nowhere on the building. She then stated it was 1800 cvs which is incorrect . I'm a state employee and with accusations like that are automatically suspended if reported which she did call an officer. I did wait outside calling corporate which I found online. The store manager Monica Hernandez is very rude and discriminating just because I am dressed in leggings and a sweater no make up, messy bun and Crocs probably thinking I'm a homeless person but I didn't refuse to pay. I was refused service which she states is her right. Please don't give them your money if they feel discriminating is appropriate treatment.; This CVS Pharmacy is disappointingly unprofessional. Every time I’d come here for a pick-up, pharmacy technicians and/or pharmacy assistants would be rude. One experience in particular made me switch locations when a bottle of Cetirizine was supposed to have a quantity of 90 but instead had a quantity of 30. I then had to pay for the prescription again (had to take the L). Oh and another thing, the pharmacy had claimed they didn’t have record of me picking anything up from their location in the past 6 months when I’ve received countless of medications, which I found strikingly unusual.

TLDR: This CVS Pharmacy doesn’t pay attention to medication quantity, they don’t keep record of when you pick up prescriptions, and their customer service stinks!; This CVS is the closest to our home.  We have lived here for 23 years.  What was once a clean, organized store with kind, professional employees has changed over the years.  The employees at the front registers are nice enough. However the store is a mess.  Empty shelves and a terrible selection of goods. I rarely bother anymore and simply prefer to order from Amazon.  I am taking the time to write this because you MUST do something about your pharmacy.  They are rude, slow and quite frankly not smart enough to be working in their positions.  I have had many terrible experiences at this location.  Medications are never ready when promised. Staff goes out of their way to make it known that they don't care.  At my last visit I picked up two of my three medications (because although my doctor's office made note of an adequate alternate drug) your store couldn't complete the entire order making it so that I had to drive to a second pharmacy. The young woman at the drive through was fine during our initial interaction, once she passed my meds through the window she didn't make eye contact or say a word.  I looked at the window and said \""Okay, is that it? Am I done?\"" Finally she picked up her phone line and said \""yes\"". It was lazy, rude and lacking simple social skills.  I have had enough and will be changing to another pharmacy for all of my family prescriptions.  Do better people. You look really bad.  I'd be embarrassed to be any part of your company.; Sorry we are ""short staffed"" seems to be the answer for every mistake. The rep said we don't have anyone that can call your insurance??? I'm sorry but your mistake is the reason why we have to call them now, really thought that would take priority. I wish they knew what it felt to go without my rx, they simply don't care. I hope management or ownership will hurry up and hire more people to avoid these issues, until then 1 star."

I am grateful he was able to help me right before they closed for lunch. Great patient care at this pharmacy and David went above and beyond to help me.; I've had nothing but good experiences with this pharmacy. Went to them because I was unhappy with the one inside target. This pharmacy helped me with everything when my son was sick a few times and when I had to transfer a prescription. They where helpful over the phone even though I knew they where busy and took the time to explain things to me. Being a new mom I'm running into many new experiences and I'm glad they've been there to help me in store and in drive-through.; Keep more products stocked on the shelves they were a little bare today.

She is knowledgeable and friendly and I've had the pleasure to have her help me several times this past week. My insurance is no longer contractual with Walgreens as of 1/1/2023. To move all my husband's and my RX's to CVS was going to take effort but Hannah's expertise and excellent customer service made it quick and easy to do. David the pharmacist is also very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly.  I'm glad I was able to have such two great people to help the transition go smoothly.  A+++ and 10/10 all around for outstanding customer service!  Thank you Hannah and David.; I picked up my Rxs for my husband today. Another hit for me at the CVS Pharmacy at 18469 N 7th St in Phoenix.  This time I had the pleasure to meet Dorothy.  She was very efficient and friendly.

I thought it was very interesting that they have a doctor's office inside of this Walgreens, I have never seen a design like this before. For architecture purposes I really enjoyed going in here, but I cannot tell you whether the doctors are good or not. They also had some really beautiful flowers outside, they even had birds of paradise. As for the product, like I said it is fairly priced and I was able to find things that I was not able to find it other Walgreens.; I am not sure what is going on here but I needed a script for my husbands blood pressure medication.  I called them on Monday to retrieve script from my pharmacy in Nebraska.  I did not hear back from them.  Tuesday I called the Nebraska pharmacy and I had them fax the script to Walgreens as Walgreens told me they didn’t have time to contact the Nebraska pharmacy. Tuesday later afternoon I called Walgreens and they said the script wasn’t ready yet but they were processing it. Wednesday I finally went in to check out why a simple but important blood pressure script wasn’t filled.  The lady told me it wasn’t done, did I want to wait for it? I said absolutely! The pharmacist was filling scripts, stapling bag and pitching them into a bin behind him. Real classy!; It is one thing to require a photo ID on products like tobacco and alcohol if the customer has a possibility that they are underage. It is another to require if from someone who has a long past looking young. Adding insult to injury is every Walgreens store does this and will not accept photo ID on electronic media even though all of Arizona law enforcement accepts it since it is issued by the government.; I went to the pharmacy and was a bit confused with my prescriptions.  The person that helped me had extreme patience with me and was very helpful since two of my prescriptions had been changed to a different dosage.  Thanks to her for keeping me on track.  I've been very pleased with all the services at this Walgreens. The waiting time was not excessive, maybe 5 minutes.; Change your provider and save yourself the headache. Stood in line today for 20+ minutes just for everyone to chitchat with an off the clock coworker that came in for her own medicine. People come there to get the meds they need, not to listen to the employees at the pharmacy talk about their covid experiences amongst each other. Ive been trying to get my wife meds for weeks now. The doctor says she did her end, insurance said it's absolutely approved, Walgreens says the doctor never sent it and it's not approved through insurance. Which out of the three do you think is giving me the run around????"

The lady from the pharmacy who administered them pushed them into my arms SO slowly, which makes it hurt way more!! OUCH!!!; My experience while printing a photo this afternoon was a wonderful experience. The guy was genuinely nice and even helped me put the photo in a frame.; The pharmacy operation manager is rude and does not know how to bill insurance. I believe the reviews for this pharmacy/store. Don't know how most of the pharmacy staff still have a job there.; I thought the reviews were a little extreme until I started using this pharmacy regularly. The wait times for filling a prescription are longer than any other pharmacy I've ever been to, even for very common prescriptions that don't need any kind of special mixing or ordering. I have never NOT had an issue with insurance at this location, despite using the same insurance at other locations. I've had to explain to multiple employees how Tricare works (extremely common insurance) and have had them argue with me about it only to call Tricare to confirm pharmacy benefits and find out that I'm correct. I primarily have filled prescriptions here for my kids when they're sick, so that makes the issues even more frustrating. Waiting hours and hours or even days to get a script filled for a sick kid is unacceptable. Today was the last straw for me, though my own fault as I should have switched pharmacies ages ago. I called just to get a status update on a prescription for my sick baby and the pharmacist wouldn't tell me whether they had even received my prescription until I gave her my insurance issue for the 4th time in a row. I'll be utilizing another pharmacy going forward.; On hold to speak with a pharmacist now for over an hour... unfortunately this is a common occurrence for this Walgreens. have never had so many problems with any pharmacy I've ever visited as I have had with this one. It's too bad because it is so conveniently located but I will be going out of my way to visit another store. Over the course of the past 4 days I have been put on hold for over on hour twice, hung up on without speaking to anyone twice, been incorrectly told that my medication is ready for pickup when it was actually out of stock, and FINALLY after I get my prescription filled and am going through the checkout process I am told ""hang on a second"" and then met by the operations manager 15 minutes later who informs me that they ""accidentally deleted"" my prescription during the checkout process and need to get a new one sent over from my doctor. So essentially day 5 and I still haven't been able to get my medication.
Something very odd is going on at this pharmacy and I will not be going back, I recommend that anyone reading this review steers clear of this location as well."

The employees are nice too and always greet you. I work in this plaza and im always greatful they let me use their bathroom to freshen up on break even when I don’t have anything to buy. Thanks guys; Pharmacy is the worst!
Understaffed, high turn over, takes forever to get prescriptions filled, never answer the phone, they dont ask if you need to talk to the pharmacist about your medication information.
Every time  I am there they are arguing with customers.; I have dealt with Walgreens for several years. As they are required by my health plan I have no real alternative. I have found them to bombard me with messages to order more drugs. In addition, when I have requested a reduction in the medication amount to be distributed they have ignored my request- distributing the 90-day max. When a prescription is back-ordered, they are slow to respond (taking multiple days) even when the medication is on hand at another Walgreens close by. If you call to find out the status of a back-order they will look up where it is available and they tell you to call that location. When you ask them to coordinate (one Walgreens to another) they tell you they are too busy. This combination of emphasis on revenue and avoidance of service is one reason why we have high health care costs and low satisfaction with our health care system."

They stock liquors I've never seen before so if you're seeking hard to find spirits I recommend checking this liquor store out.; Love this place!!! They’ve been around since I was a kid. Stopped in yesterday and picked up all kinds of things. They welcomed me and my team in and were very patient. Thanks guys!; Marks up their allocated bourbon to ridiculous prices over fair secondary prices. It’s called a museum by the local bourbon community.

Good prices, amazing selection, and plenty of sales, especially on freshly arrived cases.

Always have good supply of rare hard-to-get releases, like KBS or Bourbon County. Highly recommended to get that hard to get bottle.

And as a bonus they do help you carry it to your car, if you buy more than you can carry. Definitely good service.

I hold very elaborate events and have personally used the services of this location for years I’ll be moving to California this June. However, I wanted to personally leave a proper review.

We couldn’t recommend a better place. In the north liberty area!

Johncy I personally thank you for your service and fair sales in our community.

We will miss you on our relocation and wish you only the best.

Stay classy.

Been stopping there for a year weekly. Working my way through the inventory. 😉  Super friendly and helpful staff.; Prior to this last week, I had only been to Johncy's twice before.  Johncy is renovating for a better atmosphere, and that's great.  But what really makes this place special is that the guy is a servant to his customer.  You can't find it? He'll get it for you. He's a service first guy and has awesome prices on his goods and a HUGE selection.  Now compare that to a convenience store clerk you just pulled off smoke break to come ring up your order and I promise you'll never go anywhere else! Check them out; Great little liquor store. Great selection of beer wine and whiskey. Friendly staff and reasonable prices.; Every now and then you get it wrong, and this time I made an error.  When I called Johncy's and inquired about a delivery, I had no idea additional licensing was necessary to do what I was requesting.  I thought they did not want to deal with my request.  I wish they would have told me, but they didn't and I felt slighted. I am sure Mr Johncy runs a top notch establishment and is a man of the highest integrity and intelligence.  My apologies to his store, friends  and employees for writing a bad review."

You gotta give them an email and a phone number but they don't SPAM you up with the stuff at all. Customer service is amazing every store I go to. My only small gripe is I wish they were open later. All the ones by me are only open til 11 or 12 p.m.  And I work like a between 2nd & 3rd shift. But they're amazing nonetheless and definitely suggest you check them out!; This place has everything. Each time I have went into the store I have always been greeted and ask if I need help. They run specials on home grown products made in Indiana.  They always have a clean and wonderful store with great employees that know what they sale. U can sign up for store card to use when u purchase items to earn points towards non-alcoholic beverages.; extremely rude! I cant wear a mask for medical reasons, was asked to put one on anyway! The mandate has a medical exemption! I will never shop here again! Hire some people with some decency!; Almost all the employees are nice and knowledgeable. Free tasting on certain alcohol is a plus. Prices very fair for a liquor store. Only thing I would suggest is a bit more variety, specifically on malts, singles and other similar drinks."

Everyday I walk around the parking lot and nearby areas and find at least 15-20 of their alcohol bottles everywhere. They need to equip the areas with garbage cans considering the amount of foot traffic they receive. They are ruining the area and the neighbors are tired of them and want them to leave the area and relocate!!!; Please rotate your coolers! I got 3 large truly cans the other day and 2 were expiring in October and the other 1 expired in April? That makes me wonder how often expired beer is sold here. Now I'm wondering about the wine too.; This store is a terrible place to work. A couple of my Co-workers have been great, but the manager, Angie is absolutely horrible. She is very rude and cranky. She drives good employees away. And she refuses to have an open mind to new and better ideas. She shouldn't be a manager anywhere.; All their employees are friendly and personable. Great customer service; unlike Payless Liquors on Albany. They have the rudest costumer service reps that I have ever come across in my entire life (50 yrs). It's unbelievable how rude they are. Actually, in all honesty it is only one who is the problem. I think she is a manager. She trains the new employees to be rude like her. When they hire a ""nuwby"" they are always friendly, helpful, curious, etc... Greet you with a smile and hello. However, after working and training under this rude and hateful person for a couple weeks, they also forget their customer service skills...they become a chip off the old block
If I sound disgusted it is because I have good reason to be disgusted. I was totally humiliated and slandered in front of other customers, by this certain ""so called manager"". I could have and should have sued the establishment for what this chick screamed at me and said about me. I am sure that the company has lost many good paying customers due to this chick. I had been a daily regular for years. Although, I never liked going in there because of her. Yet, it was close to home and convenient.
Anyway, that's all I'll say about that for now.
Swing on over to Crown liquors, corner of Sherman and Raymond. I have never been given a reason to complain there. Even though my brand is a couple rollers more than the other. I guess it's a small price to pay for good and friendly service.😁😋; Friendly staff and very convenient. Only minutes away from my house. But I have decided to take my business elsewhere after tonight and can probably speak for the other customers that were planning to buy product from this same store tonight. We were told they have to close early because all systems were down. They didn't offer to take cash which I had. And I have to say not the first time I've dealt with this. Seems to be an ongoing problem with inventory issues as well. I hope for some improvement in the future."

I like that they have a sale table in the back to purchase some much-needed wine when you want to restock. Hello to all at Wyman Liquors, perhaps at times you are not nice to this person but I like you all the same. Not my family either since the world dictates as if family depends on who is paying,  when not in fact.; Picked up a couple of rare finds. Great selections.

I’m an out of town visitor, spending some time with my service man son (go Army!) and we wanted some great beer for the next few days. Enter Grapes and Hops! First off, the business is set up to serve you a beer or wine to enjoy, while you shop - a very refined experience! The store is easy to shop, the beers and wines organized by style.

Next, what a selection! You would have to be mighty hard to please to not find something you like. I was in the shop to buy beer but was impressed with both the beer and wine selection. Don’t look for big brewery products or common place wines here, this shop is definitely top shelf. Be sure to look at their port and champagne offerings!

Another feature of this store is the staff. Ask for Marcy! She was very helpful. Served our beer and answered a lot of questions. She was very knowledgeable about the stores stock and promised to research the possibility of obtaining beers not currently in stock.

My son and I spend a delightful 45 minutes enjoying a quality pint and picking over a great selection of beer. We went into the store for a six pack, but ended up with two six packs! A great way to spend some of our afternoon! The store has a variety of specials, one for everyday of the week!

Cheers!; Even though I don't come here often, the staff always makes me feel so very welcome and appreciated. I typically am by myself when I come in and I never feel out of place. Marcy is a rockstar! Gracious, kind and so cognizant of the people she helps.; Nice place. Huge selection of craft beer. I didn’t even look at the wine. They also have 10 taps for draft pours. It’s bigger than the location on Ramsey with some different beer choices, both on tap and in the fridges. I drank a draft sour from Clouds Brewing and took home a four pack of different Edmund’s Oast. The lady working was friendly and attentive. Cozy spot to sit and drink a couple of good beers.; Great place! Beer selection is on point and the ambiance is cool and relaxing. The gentleman that help us out yesterday was really professional and knowledgeable. Only thing I would add is a TV to watch a game and enjoy the great beer!; 🍷𝙵𝚛𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚍𝚕𝚢 𝚜𝚝𝚊𝚏𝚏 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚠𝚊𝚛𝚖 𝚎𝚗𝚟𝚒𝚛𝚘𝚗𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝

I was on a video call with one of my children and was talking about tent rods to fix the tent I set up in my backyard so we can all camp out. The ""woman"" working there said to me "" that's inappropriate,  talking about bras"" . I was talking about tent rods. She decided to get in my face and threaten me, not even having correct knowledge of the conversation I was having with my child. I will NEVER go back into that store with her working there. The owner at one point told the employee to walk away. She was in the wrong and completely disrespected a potentially paying customer that not only took money away from the liquor store,  but money away from Filhos, where dinner was going to be had afterwards.  Shame on her for her sickening behavior. What a disgrace to a local business that employs horrific people with such audacity to chime in on a conversation with a mother and her child that did not, in any way, have anything to do with inappropriate talk.; I love the store itself, it has a great selection to choose from. However, every time I have gone in, I feel very uncomfortable. There is a short-haired older lady that is always rude and cold. She stares at you when you pull up to the store, and is cold when you check out. I get the vibe from her that she is annoyed that you are there, and I feel unwelcome there. Back when I still had my vertical license and was newly 21 and just picking up a single bottle of wine, she was extremely rude about it. She took forever to look at my license and would claim that it was ""the wrong way."" I explained that it doesn't expire for another year, and she went on to say that because she was ""nice,"" she would accept it, but it ""would never be excepted in Boston or at bars."" I can confirm that that is not true. I've never had any problems with anyone or anywhere because of the vertical license, just from her. Needless to say, she is the only reason I almost never go to that store, which is such a shame."

Go early and often.; I am new to the area. I stumbled upon this place during my few hours off duty on Mother’s Day. I was interested in a glass of wine. The door was unlocked, there were great reviews, I thought I hit the jackpot. I was asked what I would like. I responded a glass of wine. I was then told that the Bottle Shop was having a private tasting. If the store was not open to the public, why ask me what I wanted? I left because it was not my intention to interrupt their private tasting, but there no sign or other communication indicating that I should “move along.” This was an extremely baffling experience at a place that is so highly regarded. I’m left wondering if this is the weird gatekeeping/racism I should come to expect on the North Shore. Zero stars if I had the option.; Great selection of wine although I went there for the beer found some excellent sours!! Nice atmosphere!!!  along with customer appreciation.; Could not be more impressed with the Bottle Shop, specifically owner Amy. My colleague lives in Wilmette, and I stumbled on Amy's shop online when I was looking for some place that was able to send him birthday beers.

They even ship to ya! People in Maryland love you guys! Keep up the good work and I’ll visit again soon.; My last time coming to the store was today.  I always try to buy local to keep money within the North End community, but I do not feel appreciated as a customer.  Time after time I try to start conversations, being friendly, talking about wines, liquors, and on occasion, ordering wine.  I have a 150+ bottle cellar and am always on the hunt for a new wine or spirits.  However, I always feel as if I am disturbing the owner Jeff who 9 times out of 10 bites your head off.  Today was no different; I simply asked about getting Sam Adams Utopia which comes with a price tag of no less than $240.00 a bottle.  Instead of welcoming business Jeff remains angry and rude creating an unfriendly environment.

I will now spread around my business and give all my business to the competition or direct order from wineries.  For those reading this go to Golden Goose, Hanover Wine and Spirits, Wild Duck, or if you want some fantastic specialty wines go to The Wine Bottega.  To add one more wine location that is also fantastic take a walk over to Beacon Hill and try Beacon Hill Wine & Spirits Co.

There were two cars in front of me. I have pressed the service button multiple times and they are not paying any attention. I didn’t jump into a closed lane. It’s been 30 minutes so I’m not about to leave without my prescriptions. Going inside isn’t usually any faster but I’m watching them check people out and keep their backs to me. Come on you guys!!!; Never ever answer their phone. I needed medication interaction advice and could not get it. Eventually went to voice mail but never got call back. Not people friendly.  The automated line doesn't recognize what you need and just replays the same choices over and over. Going to find another pharmacy.; *Warning* Avoid at all costs. It is criminal what they are doing. This is Medicare and Medicaid fraud down to a science. Please, federal investigators start a case on these places. My insurance covers about 98% of prescription costs at my previous pharmacy Westmoreland (that Kroger bought out for their customers database), but at Kroger's my insurance is covering less than 2.5%. Pharmacy techs say that Kroger club prices get it lower than my insurance, but even that is over 4 times more than I paid last month.

I wish that I could give these folks zero stars. I believe they are committing Medicare/Medicaid fraud. Kroger's bought out my pharmacy, Westmoreland. Prescriptions that I paid $1.20 for, with my insurance, now costs almost $20. My entire monthly prescription costs were less than $20. Through Kroger's it is over $150. I'm disabled and this is the difference between having food and having medicine.

This also doesn't account for the horrendous service. If you phone, they won't answer. You have to make at least 5 calls to even get your call answered. Orders that should be filled the same day, takes them at least 3 days to fulfill. This is a business that the community needs to come together and refuse to do business with. If you're an investor in this enterprise, you should be ashamed.; Avoid this pharmacy at all costs.
You’ll stand in line for an hour or more, just to get them to refill a prescription; and then come back later to stand in line for another hour + to pick it up.  Since they never answer the phone.
I literally almost threw my back out standing, while ONE Tech did whatever they do back there.
The line went all the way to the cash registers.
I honestly don’t understand why each and every customer has to talk to them for ten minutes, just for them to grab the medicine and go.
Half the time, the tech wasn’t even at the cash register.
WTH you doing back there???? Move the line along !!!!
This is a big problem.  Serious problem.; Just got a prescription filled and had a wonderful experience with the pharmacist Rachel and the techs. Yes, there was a 15-minute wait, but chairs were available. The tech rushed mine and another lady's script so we could get them before the staff went to lunch.

Recently there have been problems at this Kroger pharmacy, resulting in turnover most folks aren't aware of. A few weeks ago, ALL the pharmacy staff quit, according to two store cashiers. They said things would eventually get worked out but it'll take a little time. I'll give them that time, because this has been MY pharmacy for over 15 years. The staff have always treated me well, even when there were five people waiting in line.

Kroger management may want to consider raising wages. A sign near the aisle states $14/hour starting for non-certified pharmacy tech, while employees at the ice cream place in front of Kroger start at $16/hour - and they don't have to deal with irritated customers nor consult insurance companies."

Super cute and well stocked and everything was clean! Even the bathroom. The parking lot was really small though and super crowded a little bit dangerous. They should maybe get a bigger lot. The staff also was not very helpful and they didn't wanna be there I don't blame them but defintely need customer service training; I live really close by. Am an actual employee from Walmart but another location. I did some shopping with my mother who's getting Alzheimer's and she wanted to scan so I let her. But almost close to finishing and this older lady who checks our receipts for missing change that the machine didn't give us back. Because of our Dr pepper we didn't scan that was gunna be handed to the lady's in the corner by the ice machine but instead this lady got me took it up on herself to decided to checking our bags making us feel like we were stealing to come to find out we paid for everything except the Dr pepper which we handed back as she checked our receipt. I snatched our receipt well she snatched it back I re snatch it. I don't plan on coming back I personally don't wanna be employed by Walmart now because this is not the first incident I had with WALMART!. Since I've been shopping there. I've seen this lady be rude and always gets complains but yet makes it to manager or supervisor. i get she sees theft happen a lot but to make us feel like we didn't was sad, made me mad. To be asked one thing, TO GIVE US OUR CHANGE $. YET SHE HAD TO EMBARRASS US BY CHECKING OUR BAGS FOR EVERYTHING WE PAID FOR EXPECT THE DR PEPPER WHICH WE WANTED TO HAND TO THE LADY CAUSE WE CANT PICK IT UP DUE TO ME HAVING SURGERIES AND MY MOM BEING VARY OLD NOT BEING ABLE TO LIFT PROPERLy. Yes I have a picture of her. Walmart won't let me upload it to reviews; Beware when shopping here. We have multiple times ended up with food that had been expired, and not by a few days but a month or more. This time my fiance had gotten a bag of little donuts, we have never had issues before but he ended up reaching in to find them molded, why? Because they expired in June! How do you let something THAT EXPIRED still be on the shelf?! He had ended up eating one prior too so were hoping he doesn't get sick. I had gotten yogurts there before too that ended up being a month expired. We shouldn't have to be checking everything we buy to make sure they aren't crazy expired ffs. Will be glad after this month we wont be shopping here ever again because this is beyond not ok.; Worst Walmart in Tucson. Below you'll find pictures of the ""Loss Prevention Specialist "" which is extremely rude and is now harassing me if I decide to go into Walmart.  All because on July 15, 2023, while I was shopping another customer in the store stopped me to ask for help in the pet aisle and afterwards she apparently stole something. After I tried to help that lady I continued shopping. I had no idea anything was going on until I noticed a lady following me around the store. I was uncomfortable and I took a few pictures of her and then she started making remarks directed at me and when I asked her what she said,  all she would say was ""you heard me"". I informed her I did not hear her, but she refused to repeat her remarks.
Now, I was upset so with my pictures I asked a Walmart employee who she was and if she was an employee. I was informed she was a Walmart employee and worked in loss prevention. I then asked to speak with the store manager but was advised the actual store manager is not there but they have a manager on duty. When I asked the manager on duty why this lady was following me around and making rude remarks to me, the manager said my friend stole something.
I was confused because I was alone and I informed the manager I was shopping alone, at which point she basically called me a liar because the ""Loss Prevention Specialist "" told her otherwise.  I asked the manager if they were referring to the lady that asked me a question in the pet aisle and I explained there was a lady that asked me a question about dog shampoo when I was in the pet aisle but I don't know her, she is a stranger.
Needless to say, I was less than happy with how I was being treated by the manager on duty and the fact that this loss prevention lady (Walmart employee) had the audacity to make remarks to me which were obviously rude and/or unprofessional because she didn't have the nerve to repeat them.
I looked down at my full cart and said to myself, No, absolutely not, this is not okay. At this point I wanted to just walk out and leave the full cart there and drive down the road to Fry's to get my groceries BUT it was already 10pm and I had a long day at work and I was tired and still needed to make dinner.
So right there at the self check-out I decided to set aside everything in my cart except what I absolutely had to have for dinner that evening.
I advised the manager standing there, that they can now return all of these items because I refuse to give Walmart my business after how they have treated me.
BECAUSE the only thing I have done today is be nice and try answer a question when a stranger asked me for help.
I got busy and did not contact the store manager.
I have not returned to this Walmart location
UNTIL TODAY.
When despite my better judgment, I decided to stop off to return 2 things at this location, only because it was the closest most convenient location.
I purchased the items from a different Walmart location.
After walking in and standing in the customer service line I was immediately harassed treated like a criminal, complements of the same person!!
So today I took some more pictures to show corporate the employees harassing me.
The ""blonde"" in the pictures is the so called ""Loss Prevention Specialist ""
and the current manager on duty, which were both EXTREMELY RUDE, to me today for no apparent reason, other than to harass me and to be vindictive.
I will be contacting corporate because today I was harassed for returning 2 items.
Based on my 2 ""wonderful"" experiences with this ""employee"" the so called ""Loss Prevention Specialist "" she is not very good at her job because she apparently watches other people/customers(the stranger I helped) steal things and then spends her time harassing/ alienating actual customers while acting extremely unprofessional.; Arrived on my bike at 905 to return a 50 lb bag of dog food and was told I'd have to come back tomorrow. Then, to add insult to injury I was made to wait an extra 10 mins so they could check the cameras to make sure I didn't steal it. Definitely avoid this marketplace if you actually need help cuz you won't find it here.

Edit:
So, I returned today like the lady told me to. However, customer service, an oxymoron if there ever was one, closes at 6 on Sunday. She said she told me last night. However, I swear I wouldn't have waited until 7 to ride the 2 miles with an extra 50 lbs on two badly infected legs had she bothered to mention it. But on the plus side, I wasn't accused of stealing anything this time. 1.2 stars"

I also have to say there’s at least five associates on the floor helping people which is one of my pet peeves when an associate is around and they don’t   help a customer when they are in need. Like going out of their way to show them where somethings at. I saw this at least twice during my visit. Then I was looking for some thing and I told the guy to just tell me what isle it was on, he could tell me exactly what aisle and I went there and the item was exactly where he said. It smell clean in there like. I said every single thing I was looking for was right there.; This Walmart usually always has what I need. It is usually always clean apart from all the homeless outside. The only problem is check out can be faster."

He said to come back in 30min.This caused me to be unable to get my much needed medication. This is his job and one more min of inconvenience is not too much to ask. Instead he showed why Walgreens is having to close stores across the US. His attitude is one of a true underachiever and the problem with today's workforce as a whole. It's a job...; I’m absolutely furious with this pharmacy.(This is only a pharmacy review).I’m furious and disappointed because this is our main Walgreens we go to, but when you F up this bad, you get a bad review. My mother tried so hard to help my aunt who’s battling cancer get her medicine she desperately needed. After she had to call in because she didn’t hear any update from the order put in at 1pm, This pharm tech said that it would be ready 30 minutes before they close. So, she went in early because she doesn’t trust their word because they’re cutting it close and never gave an update. She checks in with them and they end up not having the medicine after saying it was being filled.They send her to the location on Silverbell after she asked where they have the medicine because she needed it tonight. She drives all the way over there and they end up not having it either. So, River location lied about them having it or what?! So Silverbell sends her to Fort Lowell and Campbell location who, guess what?! DOESN’T have it either and it ends up being too late to get the medicine. They have to go the next day to pick up the order. Walgreens you really screwed up! All you had to do was your job. Say you didn’t have the damn medicine. My mom had a full tank of gas and now has half of a tank of gas and my aunt still suffering. Complete s%#t show, Walgreens.They’re both exhausted.So, I have to stand up for them. This is the best way. You paying attention now, Walgreens?!; For the cashier Jaquie when a customer is polite, you should be polite back. A please and thank you goes along way. Terrible customer service skills; They have most everything you might need, friendly and professional staff I usually pop in at least once a month! Shampoo, toothpaste and deodorant and refreshments are some of the items I purchased at Walgreens! It's not to far from my apartment so the convenience is great, they have rewards and specials that I take advantage of as well!; It's ridiculous and absolutely annoying having to hear ""we are always hiring"" It shows dishonesty and disregard to people who actually want to work and could be applying to other places that actually need help. Either you are hiring at the moment or not stop trying to waste people's time.  I had an employee tell me that they are constantly having employees come and go. That only gives the impression that they have poor management and poor customer service, and the bad reviews to this place only proves my point."

They seem to be good hard working guys who go out of their way for customer service. Great selection of beer and wine and a surprising number of taps for your growler refills.
Prices are equal to or less than the QT down the street and they'll take requests for your favorite brand.
They have delivery available with better coverage than most Tempe pizza joints.
They do need better street signage as it's easy to drive by them if you're not looking.
Definitely worth a stop if you're anywhere near Priest  and Southern.; They have an excellent (almost overwhelming) selection of different beers, with a decent selection of wine. I picked up a couple of varied cans and a growler of a blood orange witbier which was inexpensive and delicious. I'll definitely be back to try more of their tap selection and get more growler fills. The owner told me they're working on getting a license to be able to give out samples of their on-tap beers, which will make it even more attractive for me as a growler refill station!; While visiting Tempe, I ordered wine online via Drizly and ended up purchasing from this store 2x. The delivery person was very pleasant and the 2nd time, I learned he's the owner of My Beer Wine #1.

A lovely person, and the store has great service and fast delivery. I understand that it's a new store and has a broad range of craft beer from what I see. Also has reasonable prices and delivery cost from my wine purchasing experience. I highly recommend and hope the great selection, service and pricing enable this store to continue to succeed.

However today I felt compelled to leave a review on this place for the first time. Today I walked in was not greeted nor was I asked if I needed help with anything after pacing the aisles for a couple of minutes. The male attendant was deeply engaged in a conversation with another male. Shortly after me, a white male customer walked in and surprisingly the attendant immediately acknowledged him. After my disappointment, I then proceeded to walk out which is when the attendant asked if I needed help with anything. He was completely aware of what he had just done. Very poor customer service.; Friendly associate, she called management and they made the decision not to sell us but two bottles of Moscato after driving two hours.  We were there to purchase cases.  Apparently we had the means to pay.  Stated unable to because needed it  for other customers.  To sum it up didn't want the money right then (now).  But when one store will not make a good business decision, another will.  We were able to fulfill our goal.  The trip was successful after all.; They worked hard to keep inventory up during this pandemic. Always having what I'm looking for. The employees are very friendly and helpful. Thank you.; Overpriced. Parking lot is always crowded, hard to maneuver in and out. Wouldn't suggest unless your wanting high priced wine or specific type of whiskey, brandy, bourbon or high priced champagne; $150 for a bottle of Blantons is absurd.  I’ll never buy anything from this store again after seeing how they gouge their customers on bourbons."

I’m a local business as well who spends a lot of money and cares about shopping locally. I want to support year round business here in our small town. I have had two separate experiences now with the owner, John who made promises and did not deliver.

I’ve always called days in advance, asked if there are specific times better than others to pick up and wait my turn in line with others despite putting in orders ahead of time. I was told to come down and pick up my order I had waited 3 days on. I called ahead to ensure it was there, ready to go and waiting for me. When I arrived, not only was it not there in full (he quickly could find one bottle but the others had been sold), I was told by the owner that because there was a line behind me (which I had also waited in) that he was not going to look for it and I could take part of my order or… and he shrugged at me. Needless to say I walked out without making a purchase at all. He clearly did not care about my business. The business of another local business owner. I will be sure to let anyone know every chance I get to not to take their money there as he seems to care only about himself, the larger faster dollars and not showing mutual respect to other small business owners in our very close knit South Haven.; The Depot is within walking distance in downtown South Haven. They have an amazing selection of beers, wines, and spirits. And it's got atmosphere. You owe it to yourself to check it out.; FYI the deli is only open Tuesday - Saturday. If we had seen that we wouldn’t have stopped in hoping to get a sandwich. Looks like a cool spot though to eat and they’ve got some pretty good alcohol options.; Great options, all home made sandwiches. I would definitely recommend this place for any one who wants a fresh deli sandwich foe the beach!; We pre ordered a bunch of sandwiches and a charcuterie board for our arrival during a family trip. Everyone I spoke with was so helpful and friendly. The charcuterie was impressive and was a huge hit with the group! We will definitely do that again when we’re back in town."

Gurney’s is so popular in the area that during peak summer months, you should plan on getting there around 11am if you don’t want to wait in a 30+ minute line that goes out the door. NO TOMATOES, so don’t ask! Trust me, you won’t miss ‘em.; When you see a line of people out the door, it's probably pretty good!

Gurney's is pretty good and then some! Sandwiches were made to order with generous portions of fresh ingredients on thick bread.  Delicious!; Pick up a sandwich and have a picnic.  Do not let a long line intimidate you as it moves along pretty fast... WORTH IT!; I always have great things to say about Gurney’s! Amazing sandwiches, friendly faces.

But there was a cockroach under the sticker of my homemade Twix cheesecake. Omg I was so excited to eat it too. My boyfriend and I went in because we saw the good reviews. He got a burger and I got a sandwich along with some chips and cookies and some other snacks ($43 worth). After we received our sandwiches from the deli counter, I noticed a cockroach above the cookies. Ugh I was so disappointed. I tried to think about how many restaurants I’ve eaten at that have cockroaches that I have never noticed. I tried to eat my sandwich. I really did. We threw the stuff out. I was checking over our other snacks we got from there and saw the cockroach under the deli sticker of the Twix cheesecake (pictured). I know both of the bugs I saw were cockroaches, I unfortunately know what cockroaches look like. I called the store immediately when I saw the second cockroach because at that point I didn’t even want to eat the packaged lays chips I bought. I told the woman the story and asked if I could get my money back. The woman said “yes” and nothing else, she did not sound shocked at all, nor did she question me. Anyways, when we got to the store, the woman at the register told me to show her where I saw the roach. I showed her, and I also showed her the one under the sticker. She barely looked at the sticker and told us that it’s probably a piece of peppercorn or spice from the deli. I assured her that I have great eyesight, I know what a cockroach is, and even if it wasn’t a cockroach (it was), there’s no denying that it was a bug of some sort. Definitely undeniably NOT a peppercorn/spice. The woman told me she’s there everyday and never has seen a cockroach… Based on the state of the store and the TWO that I saw, I highly doubt it, or she needs to visit an optometrist. Not sure how the health department hasn’t done something. At the end of the day, we got all our money back, even though she questioned if we wanted a refund for the whole order… Umm yes? We do? Cockroaches are not to be messed with. Stay clear unless you’d like an extra protein surprise 😊; Best “Home Town Deli” ever!

I make it a priority now if I'm on that side of town. They always have a lunch special, or you can just order off their menu with a variety of condiments for everyone. I love they have jalapenos to add to my sandwich.  Prices are great, your dollar goes a long way and all the homemade cookies are to die for.

Friendly staff, great selection, and a large friendly dog to greet customers. This place is lacking nothing. So thrilled with an allocated find today!; The people are friendly, and the selection is good, however my one complaint is pricing is not always current. There will be one price on the sticker in front of the selection on the shelf, and when you get to the register it is higher. They always push it off as O well we just haven’t updated the computer yet, but it happens all too frequently.; The most amazing Staff on hand to help with all of your drankin' needs! Excellent  selection, second only to the service!; I wish the people that work there were a little friendlier. Also when it is evident that you need help carrying everything out it would be nice if they would offer instead of having to ask or making a second trip. Shopping carts within the store would be nice."

This place deserves zero stars.  Scum of the Earth.; Guy that works there in the evenings is always nice and they have an amazing variety and selection of vapes. my go-to now!; Visited this store for a bottle of bourbon priced $129.99 on Drizly. Their shelf price was $199.99. I showed the women and man in the store the price on Drizly. The women then called the store manager. He would not honor their price on Drizly. The man then made a joke about me to my face, and I told it wasn’t funny and he shouldn’t be making jokes about customers to their face.This is a classic ‘bait & switch’ scam. Beware!; Sign outside said Jamison 41.99. Inside it’s 49.99. The nice lady asked the boss and he said the sign is broken and then told me to go somewhere else. Very rude and obviously he hates his store. Everyone else was nice. I wouldn’t spend a dime in this store ever. Classic bait and switch. If the sign is broke easy fix.  Flip the breaker. Sign isn’t broken; Selection is amazing. I don't particularly like being watched as if I'm stealing stuff though... But I get it. Maybe it's just the area or something.

Thank You; This Walgreens got robbed. When I went to buy a snickers, pork skins, dove chocolate and a orange juice. I was at the line waiting to pay my items. But that's not why I'm writing this review is cause of the simple fact that when the GM was walking by on my side of the line and speaking on his phone. He expresses his frustration with the word ""again"". I do think that the safety of any one in this Walgreens goes first. I would never thought that just paying a security guard was too much money or unthinkable for Walgreens to invest. Especially when their was a first time. Our life are not a joke Walgreens. I do believe Walgreens should care more about their customer. Thanks; Store is pretty clean even the bathrooms. Staff is very rude especially girl at check out Lizabeth."

I came here for hard-to-find bourbon, and they have it. At the most reasonable prices I have EVER seen. They don’t play games or try to get more money out of you. Adam and Rick were super friendly and helpful, part of what made the experience great was chatting with them. Come here first if you’re looking for a great bourbon shop!!

Update: I've been here 2 years and still love shopping here. A hometown feel with variety I can't find in the big stores. Perfect portions of meat and beautiful local produce for just 2 people.; Service here is always friendly and happy to help. Caribou service is good too, I'm from MN and love that Caribou Coffee is at this location.
The deli food is delicious, love the specials...pot roast is fantastic.
The parking lot, store, and bathrooms are always clean.
Uhaul service has been slow the 2 times we have used it, though I don't think its their fault, it's uhaul's system.; I just had the best experience grocery shopping at this Country Market location. A big shout out to Jeff in the meats who talked hunting and fishing with me and then hooked me up with the best shrimp at a better price. I don’t think I’ll shop anywhere else while I live in the area.; Staff was great, polite. Prices could be a little more competitive, but can't they all? The selection is good, even better saving with the penny pincher and Max card. (They do not have to be used together.) A decent organic section, and they have the widest collection of liquor shots.

I don't know much about liquor but sometimes my recipes call for certain types of wines or liquor and I'm pretty oblivious as to where they are located in the store so the staff takes time to help me search but mostly knows where to find it and about the types I need for my dishes.; Definitely has one of the biggest varieties of wines to pick from definitely need to check it out if you're looking for something like that great people very knowledgeable help you find it if it's at another liquor store; Bill and Denny are awesome. However the new manager,  I don't have any nice words to say about her. She accuses people of things that are not true. She followed my mom around the store.; Bill is awesome! The second we walked in, he greeted us and asked if there was anything we were looking for in particular. My fiancé told him he was looking for a specific brandy, so Bill walked us over to the brandy. We didn’t find the exact one we were looking for, but he had some other suggestions for us. I haven’t tried it yet, but one of his suggestions was a mixture of a peanut butter and a chocolate liquor. I can’t wait to give it a try!

Bill is 100% the reason we will come back to this liquor store. He’s such a nice guy and extremely helpful! It just seems like he really cares, and that’s rare nowadays."

God bless you and thank you for reviving my hope in humanity.; Great customer service. Took care of customers and had everyone smiling entering and exiting! Definitely will come back again.; I called the store 5 times at 3 in the afternoon to check on availability of an item and no one answered the phone. When I finally got through I was told they have 7 of the appliance items I was looking for in stock.  But once I got to the store there was none. After I did other shopping the night clerk at the register didn't even know what he was doing so I had to move to another register just to pay, leaving one of my bags behind on the carrosel. From my experience a very poorly managed store.; Very clean friendly, always find someone to help you if you can't find it. Large fishing, camping and ammo selection. Now selling guns and more....they have just remodeled the interior of the store.; Don't go here if you work late and need something last minute they close at 11. It was ten minutes till they closed and I was told I couldn't come inside at first I had to haggle with the lady to get something to feed my dogs and baby wipes for my kid.

While I was inside going down an isle to get these things a worker stops me and yells aggressively at me that ""we're close you have to leave right now"" In response I asked can I just get what I need to get??? These people are ridiculous and aggressive between 10:45-11."

Had some great informative conversations. Raise your spirits here; Great experience in the store over the weekend. Instantly greeted as I walked in and was asked if I was looking for anything in particular. I've been looking for Weller 12 and Weller Antique for awhile now and while Nas explained why it's been hard to find but told me that if he comes across a bottle he'd let me know. I shared a story about my sister in law finding a bottle of Elijah Craig 18 for my brother and how I was hoping to find one as well. I had just met Nas and he told me he thought he had one at a different location. He didn't have to do that but I truly appreciated his kindness so I bought the Basil Hayden Red Wine Cask Finish
since I've been intrigued by it for awhile before I left his store. He called to verify the EC18 was still available since it was on the other side of town and didn't want me to drive there if it was already gone. True to his word, I was able to purchase it today. Great service at both locations. Too often I read reviews detailing negative experiences so I definitely wanted to share my positive experience. Thank you Nas. You're a team player!; I like liquor Bueno. Effie is a great employee.  She knows my name and always greets me with a smile.  Maybe you can get some blinds for the front window for your customers and employee s. Thanks; Good selection, friendly and helpful staff working here. I’ve gotten multiple recommendations from staff and they are always happy to help pick something new or find something you’re looking for; First time in the  store and the guy would not sell me liquor. He thought I was drunk because I went to door next to the entrance. He had no reason to suspect I was drunk and I do not even like to drink alcohol.

I did that move because I was waiting to meet a friend, he was running late so i thought I would look around and buy a bottle of wine for my wife.

He had no reason for his comment and i will never buy anything from this place and I strongly discourage anyone from buying anything, unless you want to be considered a drunk."

The attendant was very nice and helped us get a discount on some beat-up bottles. So we were able to save even a few more bucks. Awesome selection if you are looking for craft beer.; I honestly think this is the best craft beer store in DFW. I’ve gotten to try so many new and great brews by shopping here. If Anun (not sure how to spell his name, but he’s the really cool younger dude) is working, he always has fantastic recommendations. That dude can tell you about almost any beer they sell, which is very impressive considering their extensive collection of local and regional craft brews. He’s genuinely the best and seriously deserves a raise. And if Prisma is working, she’s always super polite and nice to interact with. If you love beer, live in the area, and don’t frequent this place, you’re really messing up. I’d honestly give 6 stars if I could!!!; There may be a few places that have a bigger selection but no one with more rare beers. This is a craft beer lover's Paradise, hands down!; Been going here for years.  This place is awesome because for a store so tiny, they carry hundreds of beers.  Even rarities like big bombers from local, far away, and international breweries.  If you're a beerknurd and you live on the east side, this place is a must.  Try them once, come back for life."

Annoyed with the city for banning tobacco here (I don't use tobacco to be clear) because the connected Hy-Vee sells it all so really it's just lost funding for the park department but really that's beside the point.; Great liquor store...

They have hired some new people and one of the females is rude.  Actually now I think about it most of the employees could be a bit  friendlier, there's like one employee who's cool.

I had an unexpected problem with a payment card once, and the staff did everything they could to help me resolve the issue. Without me having you ask, they kept my order pulled save ready until I fixed the problem. The store has an update atmosphere, and the staff appear to get along.

The layouts great lots and lots of wine about three-quarters of their coolers that wrap around more than half the store is wine and craft beer. Very impressed and got my 12 year old Weller's and my Special Reserve I'll be going back soon! Glad to meet these fine gentlemen.; The very best liquor store!!! The owner and employees are extremely professional, friendly and generous. Gave me a gift on my birthday!!! I love this store and how the new owner cleaned it up, refurbished it and stocked it everything and anything one could ever want!!!! The very best selection in town!!!; Unprofessional rude. The three guys working behind the counter we're not very welcoming when in just to buy some lotto tickets they didn't say thank you for my business I tried to break the ice and say Merry Christmas and the three of them standing there with their turbans on their head just gave me the coldest stare and replied with ""no thank you"". This is America if you don't like what the United States is about and the love we have for Christmas you can get the hell out of here. Just really pissed me off it's the holiday season supposed to be cordial and nice so I tell everybody I know not to ever go to that store again boycott it at every means"

On the other side of street is Original Tommy’s Burgers which I haven’t try yet but farther than that there is Super Char Burgers which I came across ordered a burger & fries with high prices. Inside the liquor store with great prices of snacks, beverages, liquors & much more!! Great selection for me to purchase & play lotto scratcher tickets. The owner at the counter who is kindfulness, friendly, smart & super duper nice to me. Not rude, very good attitude of which I could tell very polite. Having no issues. Keep up the great work definitely come back again. Nice & clean, well organized. Of course I like the hot weather. Anyway I highly recommended visiting to City Market 21 Liquor store & the customers must try fast food burger & fries at Tommy’s & Super Char Burgers if you come across. This was my best day I had ever experienced.; I was there today at 12:50pm. I bought a money order and paid with four 100 dollar bills. Everything seemed good until I was in my car writing info on the money order when he clerk came out and said one of the bills was fake. I went back in and saw that the bill shown by him was fake. I was a retail store manager for over 10 years and know how to spot a fake money when I actually check.  The only thing is that I tend not to check anything that I get directly from a bank. I quit my job prior to Covid so any 100 dollar bill I have now is from Chase. Now here is the what gets me frustrated. He showed the surveillance video of the whole transaction. I saw that he kept my 4 bills separate from the rest of the store money until the last minute. He took one bill that he was comparing my bills with from the drawer, turned around, and walked out to the parking lot to talk to me, presumably to show the difference between the two?  I watched the video till this point and decided this guy is good and I must have had the fake bill all along. If that one bill he took from the store drawer was the problem why would it be in the drawer in the first place? He seemed to me a straight forward person. I paid him the 100 then came home fuming to call Chase. The Chase customer pointed out something that I hadn't thought of. That I've always used an ATM, never went to a teller to withdraw money.  An ATM machine makes a mistake. What is going on. ANYWAY. This isn't to blame the store.
Everyone at this store always has been friendly and helpful. I get no nonsense straight honesty vibe every time I visit this store. The store is well organized and very clean.  The clerk was very calm, polite, and accommodating the whole time I was there. I really appreciated that he didn't get emotional.; City Market #21 is a gem among liquor stores.

There were 5-6 people in line at the register, so I joined the line. When it was finally my turn, I showed him the order details. Description of the cashier: long hair, goatee, light skin, and about 5 feet 9 inches tall. He pointed to a place, barking, ‘Wait over there,’ without even looking at me. I tried to explain that I was there for an order pickup, but he didn’t listen. All he said in return was, ‘Wait there,’ yelling again without explanation. At that moment, I felt completely and helplessly discriminated against. What was worse, he kept serving the next customers, continuing to put on that fake smile on his face, being courteous with them while I had just been ignored and dismissed in less than a minute. The difference in his behavior towards me versus the others made me feel deeply humiliated and angry. I knew without a doubt that it was prejudice driving his actions, and it left me furious and incredibly hurt. Clearly, this store employs racist and mean-spirited people, and if fair and decent treatment matters to you, you shouldn’t give your business to people like this.”; Jason’s Wine and Spirits is more than just a liquor store—it’s a cherished cornerstone of the Silverlake community. Every time I walked through the door, Harry, the owner, greeted me with his signature, “Party time?” which always brought a smile to my face.

I vividly remember one time when I walked in with tears in my eyes, going through a particularly rough patch. Harry noticed and took the time to offer me some profoundly wise advice that I will always hold dear. His empathy and support in that moment were truly touching and made a lasting impact on me.

During the two years I lived in Silverlake, Jason’s Wine and Spirits became a weekly ritual for me, and even now, I make a point to stop by whenever I'm in the area. It’s a place where you can count on finding not only what you need but also a sense of community and warmth.

That place is a 5 star compared to this. It almost feels as though there is a candid camera. I mean you can’t be this bad. First I tried calling to avoid waiting for my script to be filled no answer for the entire 45 minute ride here. Second for whatever reason with Walgreens they need you to show up to start the process of preparing your script. This place lacks processes and training. This is like going to the circus minus the fun and cotton candy. Hands down worst pharmacy I have ever been to; Oh my, where to start. I got used to going to Safeway, but my new insurance wouldn’t cover RSV vaccine type, so off
to Walgreens I go. I made an appointment, filled out all relevant paperwork, and when I got to
the counter 20 minutes in advance, I had to do it all again! Then I waited and watched all the chaos behind the counter. Customers complaining about prescriptions not ready,etc. When the pharmacist was ready, I had to sit in a corner behind a screen. Customers were seated so close they could watch. No privacy, pretty sure a HIPPA violation. Dirty and cold. Never again. Walgreens, shame on you.; The absolute worst experience with the pharmacy. After waiting 3 days for a prescription for a rash, I finally had to ask my provider to send my prescription to Safeway who filled it in less than an hour. Walgreens told me multiple times my prescription was ready, and yet it never was. Then they told me that they “didn’t have instructions from my provider.” My provider confirmed that they did have instructions. Then, they told me it would be another 36 hours to get a simple cream for a rash. Save your energy and time and avoid this place. They are so unhelpful and not willing to give you an ounce of their time.; If you take a medication that you cannot go without for a day, DO NOT USE THIS PHARMACY. They are so disorganized that my medications are never filled on time. They will absolutely leave you hanging with no medication. Prescriptions are often delayed with no action taken by the employees. The only way to get your prescriptions filled is to call. If your medication is out of stock, they will not order it for you or even tell you, until you call.

Of course, calling means waiting on hold for 10-60 minutes, only to be treated like an inconvenience and be transferred around.

I have tried to be patient with these people. Their employees are disorganized, rude, and condescending. Walgreens has used their monopoly power to ruin local pharmacy care.; Update: Within hours of posting this review the pharmacy flat-out cancelled my order- I immediately called and inquired why, and was advised yet again that it was out of stock and they would not be requesting shipment. I told the supervisor that I have a voicemail, email, and two call logs where I was told this was being ordered and would be ready tomorrow, and she said that was false information and to go elsewhere. I asked why this would not have been disclosed a week ago when the RX was sent to them and she stated she does not work every day and is not responsible for what was relayed to me previously. I’m truly mortified by the blatant lies and disrespect from this facility, never in my life have I experienced this kind of treatment from a pharmacy.
—
This is the most deplorable pharmacy location I’ve ever had to rely on for prescriptions- like other reviewers have stated they are constantly making critical errors and have zero empathy for the delays that coincide. I had a prescription sent by my provider on a Thursday morning- as per usual with this location I immediately received notice that it was out of stock, and they would have to order supplies. The following business day I received a call from an actual tech that my prescription would be ready Monday. Monday morning comes around, suddenly the prescription is marked “delayed per insurance issue”- I knew for a fact this wasn’t correct as I’ve had this pharmacy fill this exact medication before. I personally call their extension, am put on a rotational hold for over thirty minutes just to be told the previous person that worked my order not only failed to actually ORDER it, but also incorrectly entered my insurance. I relayed to the tech that I am a day shy of being out of my meds, and she coldly responded there was nothing she could do.

I don't think they have a restroom considering that many of these small stores don't. However they do get a lot of business. They are centrally located on W Cocopah Street and South 15th Ave. I give this door five stars simply because they are very neat clean, professional and fully stocked. 👍; This store is a hidden gem in the heart of Phoenix. It's a small grocery store with a big heart. It has a little bit of everything at very reasonable prices. The owner is often seen working in the store and welcoming customers. If you're in the area, I recommend Family Market over any convenience store around. You won't be disappointed.; This store opens at 6am closes at 10pm they have a lot of varietys of your everyday wants and needs including food and household items dog food ,grills,etc it's worth it since their our no major stores in the neighborhood I would definitely recommend coming here you won't be disappointed ..; I searched and searched everywhere for the lowest price on a gass refill canister for my one burner butane gas stoves went to Walmart the first time for one but this time they didn't have any. Then I found Family market on the web $2.94 including the tax. I called ahead a very nice sounding lady gave me the price. And I was on my way. I didn't have a chance to look around as soon as I walked in and asked for the refill can for a stove they knew what it was and about 5 seconds later I already payed and I was out the door.

When shopping I found the items I needed without fidgeting other items. There are labels showing of which size and brand.

The place is calm, no over shouting, people running or heavy crowd. The atmosphere is welcoming and gives you sigh or relief when shopping.

Cashier was excellent; showed firm posture, welcoming smile, and well understood conversation.

I HIGHLY recommend this place.; I placed an order online at this tab location, once the order was placed I called to confirm the order because the process was very quick and it seemed a little odd. I spoke with a manager by the name of Thomas. He was very rude to me on the phone, all I had asked was if her could verify the order that I had placed online. He kept speaking over me and was very condescending. I was at the store within a few minutes, when I arrived I asked the person at the order pick up window if he could please verify my order. He was able to a very polite about it too. I asked to speak with Thomas, who again was very rude and defensive. All I had asked was how come he couldn’t verify my order. He then proceeded to talk over me and made me feel very uncomfortable. After I that I stayed to please leave me alone and I will wait for my order. He then proceed to keep berating me about the conversation and wouldn’t stop. He kept remarking about how smelt I front of the entire store. It was very embarrassing and I have never experienced it before in my life, especially by a member of your management. I asked how to identify him when I leave a review. He states “ I’m the only Thomas at this location covered in tattoos. I will never shop at Target again!; Walked into Target to purchase a few things for my new home I purchased. Within 5 minutes of being in the store, Khadigah, African-American female with black dreadlocks with blonde streaks asked me to leave the store. After she approached me, she then walked over to several other personnel to leave the store immediately. I do not know why any of us were asked to leave the store but approximately 11 people were asked to leave the store. An older gentleman approximately 55-60 was also asked to leave. Her exact words were on the radio, “I don’t know what these people are doing in my store but I’m mixing them all out because they looked suspicious.” She did not ask approximately 7 other people she walked by to leave. I’m extremely disappointed with this interaction with his Target. I will not be coming again and I’m highly upset that I was told to leave and was unable to complete collecting the things I added to my shopping cart in the app before being told to leave the store. The rest of the employees were respectful, but Khadigah was extremely rude.; Love shopping here. It's always so clean 😍.  Top it off you have Starbucks ,too. Enjoying my refresher drinks or ice cold coffee as I'm shopping. I'm even happier cuz I even enjoy groceries, clothing, kitchen and etc. So convenient for me. Saves me time and I don't need to go anywhere else. 😉; First let me say that as of mid October 2022 the parking lot is a mess of chain link fencing blocking off almost half the front parking area while they do some kind of update or repairs or something. At low volume times for shopping this won't be a big deal, but any other times it is nutty trying to get a spot very close to the door.
Next I will say, all right, it's Target. They have the stuff from their weekly ads plus many of your household staples. The store seems clean and organized, but like almost every Target I've been to in the last 6 months, there are so many empty shelves and so many times I use the Target app and it says what I want is in stock, and I go to the aisle it should be on, but it's not there. Sold out, out of stock. This happened to me in 3 different states in the month of October alone, so I guess that's just how it is these days. Even so, kinda bugs me to drive out there and blam, no thingamajig or whatsit. I don't want to mail order my supplies for daily living.  Sometimes I need them today!
Now how about something good? They had plenty of carts and hand carry shopping baskets and they were fairly clean. They have self-checkout and real cashiers. I love browsing the clearance racks. This time I didn't even need to, though, because I found some lovely $5 women's everyday wear t-shirts, soft fabric and nice colors. Had to get two. Upon checking out with the real cashier person, I was asked if I had a phone number to type in for loyalty rewards, but when I said no, there wasn't any uncomfortable insistence that I sign up for their plan. I loved that. I get sick of handing out my data like lollipops.
Overall, a solid 4 stars, going up to 5 stars when the parking lot is fixed and when they tackle supply chain issues or stop saying they have stuff laying around to buy when actually they don't."

How can you accuse someone of stealing and after it turns out your wrong, you don't apologize? Even after you have held the accused against their will for an hour and ripped open each of their grocery bags? Not to mention embarrassed someone who already has social anxiety and was just trying to get some quick groceries for her baby? And to top it off, after you realized they did not steal, you follow them out to their car so they still look like a criminal when YOU were in the wrong? As a nurse, do you know what kind of set back you just caused this person mentally? To be held, and aggressively accused while surrounded by three individuals? For some people with this mental illness it can take years to take a big step like shopping on your own. What kind of training does Walmart provide their managerial employees? Discriminating against someone who has to use EBT assistance is pitiful to say the least. Struggling to make ends meet is already hard enough without people like Manager Denise on the loose. Just because you have the title of manager, it does not allow you to treat people the way you did tonight. A complaint against Manager Denise has been made to corporate and hopefully Walmart will take this matter seriously or a lawsuit for pain and suffering may need to be made based on manager Denise's negligence this evening.; Well stocked and has everything you'd hope for a super walmart.  I must say the self check out lines can be terribly long during times and it's quite frustrating when you only have one human operated register.

Ordered my stuff to realize he didn't get all of my order so had to order again. Then I said I didn't get my lemonade, it's because he didn't put it on my second order, so I had to order again.

Thankfully another CUSTOMER helped me, (MUCH more than any employee) with tired, hungry little kids! So disappointed in how Walmart has become less & less customer friendly, helpful, and CARING!!; It's a Walmart what can I say? They got cute stuff sometimes; I recently visited the Apache Junction Walmart and my experience was fairly average, leading me to give it a 3-star rating.

On the positive side, the store has a wide variety of products and competitive prices, which is always a plus. I was able to find most of the items on my shopping list without much hassle. The layout of the store is fairly straightforward, making it easy to navigate.

However, I did encounter some issues during my visit. The checkout lines were longer than expected, and it seemed like there weren’t enough cash registers open, which led to a frustrating wait. Additionally, I noticed that some shelves were not well-stocked, particularly in the grocery section, which was disappointing.

The staff I interacted with were polite, but there was a noticeable lack of assistance available on the floor. I had a couple of questions about product locations, and it took some time to find someone who could help.

Overall, while the Apache Junction Walmart has potential and offers great products at reasonable prices, they could improve on customer service and stock management. I hope my next visit will be a better experience!; It was ok but no cart available for the handicapped.  Then we cut our shopping short because of that n then NO people to check ya out we had to go to self check out. I do not do that. If I want a job to do that then I would get one but I don't. I'm retired n will not check my self out.  If the guy at the self check out wouldn't check me out I would have walked out n left it all there.; Self checkout ""clerk"" accused my wife of theft/deception. She buys the same produce every week. She was accosted by the ""clerk"" and said she did not even look up the item. She has a memory longer than a piss-ant.

Has obscure things you may be looking for, sometimes you just have to ask as they may not be in obvious locations (or that could just be me). Depending on who you ask you can ask a staff member who is encyclopaedic about where everything is. Bonus!!; Walmart in Maricopa is a well-stocked and clean store, providing a good shopping experience that meets expectations. The store is always busy, being the only Walmart in town, which speaks to its popularity and convenience.

While I haven't had much interaction with the employees, the overall shopping experience has been positive. Notably, Dickey's Barbecue Pit inside the store has closed, though it wasn't a favorite of mine anyway.

In summary, Walmart Maricopa offers a reliable and efficient shopping experience, providing a wide range of products in a clean and organized environment.; Went in to this location 9/12/24 with $26 in rolled coins (2) $10 rolls, (1) $5 roll & (2) .50 rolls. Paid for my items at the register with no problem. A older woman of color was working. Went back in 9/13/24 to purchase something for my child that totalled $23 & again wanted to use rolled coins. This time a non woman of color was working and told me they can't take rolled coins. I asked why not as I just used rolled coins the previous night. She went to get a manager also another woman not of color and I was told I had to PAY to use the coin star machine to then get cash to turn around and pay for my items. I asked why and she said they get Canadian coins and have never taken rolled coins it's always been store policy which is untrue. Then I proceeded to unroll the roll of quarters to show her it is American currency and in fact the correct amount in the roll. She then say I still can't accept this. I ask why not & she says because we don't accept change. So first you wouldn't take my money because it was rolled, then you wouldn't take it because it may be Canadian, then you wouldn't take it because it was change all together. She then says with an attitude fine I'll take it this one time and walks away from the register. I'm standing there looking around and she comes back and tells me I can only use it in the self checkout lane. Another worker who was Hispanic and very nice suggested that once she heard the manager tell me no but I didn't want to hold up the line putting coins in the machine one by one because only 4 out of the 8 self checkout machines were working the other 4 had out of order signs on them. I did end up using the machine because it was my last resort. I need someone to help me understand what was the difference between taking my money at the register and it taking 1-2 minutes for the transaction vs refusing me and making me hold up the line in self checkout. I spent the same exact coins, I spent the same amount of money, it's all going to the same exact place at the end of the night. Terrible customer service. Literally the worst Walmart experience ever.; The manager sucks!!! The store is dirty! They have frozen ice cream cakes that are already half melted, still trying to sell. Frozen fish case has frost outside of doors. Most employees are rude. They stock shelves during business hours.  They are always out of stock of affordable grocery products. Please take those online order employees out of customers' way. We are the customer, not them. They just push customers out of way with those big carts. Go shop in Casa Grande, now they have a good manager that keeps their store well stocked and very clean. Maybe they need to bring in a manger that cares and get rid of the worthless one they have now. He needs to put his Doritos down and get to work. Save your time and go elsewhere.; Associate was the most unfriendly person. Never smiled or uttered anything. No HELLO nothing.
I had arranged my merchandise accordingly on the belt. Keeping cans together and cold items together to help the scanning process. She put chips with canned good so I ended up with crumbs. Did not keep cold items together to help them stay cool on the commute home. I LIVE IN ARIZONA. Hello!!!!!!!!!!
Only put 4 cans per bag/2 boxes of pasta per bag.

I normally use self checkout because I don’t like standing in long lines but Walmart has changed the policy of 15 items or less for self checkout. AND IM OK with that. That’s how it should be. I was actually stocking up on stuff due to the strike at the shipping ports and was happy to go to a cashier.

Since our move to Arizona I have been doing most of my shopping at Fry’s because they have some really great deals. I almost exclusively shopped at Walmart prior to our move and know that some items are priced better at Walmart. But never have been so disappointed and irritated by a cashier before that I felt compelled to voice my frustration.
NO THANK YOU. NOTHING!!!!!!!

The ice cream case needs defrosting and the staff needs trained on how to wipe down registers in between customers. Not just stand and talk. Customer service went down hill.; This is not an exaggeration, I waited for 3 hours at the Walmart pick up for 14 items. I was picking up an order for my mom so I didn’t know how small the order was until it was eventually brought out. I got there right at 5 when my order should have been ready and we got told that they were so behind on picking it would be an hour wait, that we should go home and come back. We don’t live in buckeye so that’s not an option for us. After 2 hours the team lead tells us that the 5 people she had picking all went to lunch at the same time so they hadn’t even started our order yet. Idk why she couldn’t go and get the 14 items. It was after 8 o’clock they brought out the order, it was only 2 totes! I asked “is that really it?” And they didn’t answer me just said thanks and ran inside. I checked and they didn’t even get the order right, I had to call and have them come back. The team lead admits she saw them bring the wrong item yet she still let them bring it to me??? She was able to walk into the store and bring the two correct items, why was the associate not able to get the correct items if the team lead found them so quickly? The entire 3 hours we had to sit there and wait every other car that came received their order and got to leave. There was multiple moments that we would be the only car in the pick up area. If I had known how small the order was or if they would actually give you your money back right away I would’ve had my mom cancel the order; I could’ve gone inside and grabbed those items in 10 minutes. I don’t understand why it was so hard to get my order or how it could possibly take that long then to not even get it correct is crazy. I asked if there was anything we could receive to make up for this and she tells me she needs to find a coach, don’t you think you should have gotten them after the first hour, or the second hour, or the third hour. She tells us there’s nothing they can do, to call the store in the morning and ask for Chad. I tried and kept getting the run around. It was the most ridiculous experience I’ve ever had.; Update: 05/11 and 05/13
Still a great customer service department. Very understanding and considerate. Had an issue with an online order pickup and they gave me the wrong item and Customer Service took care of it immediately. 🤙🏼

Great Customer Service. Not a big Walmart, but decent size to go shopping from automotive to groceries. Great neighborhood stop. Only open until 10PM, so get there early.

Update: 07/28/2023.
Been trying the curbside pickup service for a few months now and it's been going well. The service and staff are also great. Polite, courteous, helpful in bringing out your order.; I really do enjoy shopping at this Walmart location (Watson Rd & Yuma)!
I have very rarely had to do without an item because the employees here keep things stocked up.
On the occasion I cannot find what I am looking for, I'll ask an employee.  They are always willing to help me locate it and one even helped me order it for delivery.; Took my 5 year old with me today to do our regular grocery shopping,  and as usual, we grabbed everything we needed and went to self checkout (because you have to) , which I absolutely hate! Who wants to scan and bag all their own groceries? Anyhow, I always scan the big stuff that doesn't fit into bags last because it makes it easier for the people at the door to find it on the receipt (cases of water, soda, laundry soap, etc.). The lady who was at the door (I wish I would have gotten her name) was absolutely the sweetest! She gave my daughter a sticker and then gave her this bracelet! My daughter was so happy! This lady just made my 5 year old the happiest little girl in the world today! Thank you to whoever you are!"

I rarely return things, but I did have my receipt showing the purchase was split in half between a gift card and my Target red card, which I preferred the return to my Target red card.  I was told I had to have it back on a gift card so I said okay well is there a manager I can speak with because I'm sure that that can be done. The manager Maddie was firm on no we cannot give it back to your red card it must be a gift card even though it was a split tender on the receipt.  When I asked to speak with someone higher than her, that is then when she said she can make a one-time exception, which she could have very well done in the first place.  I find it odd she could do it when I asked to speak to a higher manager.  Because of the attitude and tone she used and the poor way she handled the situation, Target has just lost a very long- term customer and Red card holder.  If I ever shop at Target again, it definitely won't be this location.; We have been shopping at this location since it was just a Target, sans SuperCenter. Recently, Target invested in Smart Carts, most likely to combat theft. It is completely understandable, however, the new carts are not built for people who are under five feet tall. The clerks have been so kind in trying to get the carts to work for me, but there is a design flaw. After leaving in tears last week from having to walk through the whole store on a recently replaced knee, I entered the store yesterday to find one of the routine carts available. I don’t know if it was in response to my issue, but it was a kindness I greatly appreciated.; Was a great location until socks, face wash and a million other things became locked behind plexiglass. I don’t want to wait 10 minutes for a customer service rep to come unlock something, then again for the next item because you don’t want to hire more security.; Large store with a massive selection of many products with excellent every day deals. Having the Target Circle Rewards is another benefit to doing your shopping that will save you money over time. The toys/collectibles always are picked over and gone through. The toy lady with the curly hair sets aside cases on her cart for dealers/scalpers of the newest, highly sought-after items. It's really disappointing because it's not fair to the other customers. There's always a good selection of merchandise, store is clean and employees are friendly & helpful, especially the cashiers when coupons don't scan or there's an overcharge. I wish they would open more registers. Sometimes it gets really busy and the self checkout line is a mile long and there's only 1 or 2 registers out of the 20 or so that are closed.; I am in a leg cast and when I went into store yesterday there were no wheelchairs. A man working at guest relations went to other side and drove one down for me. Very nice. He said “if the battery runs or when your shopping let a team member know and we will bring you another”.
I shopped for probably about 20 minutes and then worst scenario happened. I had three bars of battery to dead in a matter of a few minutes so no time to anticipate it.
I tried to make it over to one of the red towers to use the phone but no phone in the tower.
I used my cell phone which was also almost dead and called front desk. The man who helped me earlier answered and said someone would bring me a new one.
I waited 15 mins and called back. No one answers after long time of ringing. I called again and the man answered again but didn’t greet me. He said “we are working on getting you a wheelchair” I said ohh did you run out? He said yeah, I said if someone could please bring me a regular cart so I am not stranded here that would be appreciated.
I waited another 15 mins.  No one came. I left on my own. I noticed when I was passing by guest relations there were two people standing there talking with no customers in line. Why couldn’t someone bring me a cart?? I had to hobble out of there in my leg cast."

The greeter at the entrance warmly welcomed me and asked if I was able to find everything I was looking for, setting a friendly and helpful tone right off the bat.

I understand you can’t control the people get $100 cart fulls after close , but you can’t cut off store hours. Walmart needs to figure it out. “My cashiers NEED to leave” I heard the lady half yelling at a man at the door…. It’s self checkout , babe. It’s a store. There’s full store hours. There’s not a “last call” on a store like a restaurant. Covid hours need to be fixed.; My husband hates that it's fully self check out!

Wanted to leave zero stars but has to add one to leave this review.This was the worst liquor store experience. We decided to stop here due to the convenience of it being next door to the gas station. But more importantly.. my sister and I were followed by a man who was sitting in the parking lot in a older Pontiac Bonneville (license plate
Y00 68A). I believe he accompanying to the bald ""creepy man"" who worked there. He not only stared us down as we exited the store but stalked us when we were at the gas station and proceeded to followed us out of the parking lot into a different gas station down the street (as we were being cautious and wanted to be in a more public place).

From beginning to end the process was not only easy, but Stefanie and the team were personable, helpful and a pleasure to work with.

While atthe register waiting to pay i noticed the date on it had expired, when asked, she said (you no nothing no drinking you no understand) i guess she was trying to say its okey but i just walked out. It was the last time i went in there. The next day i went to the store next to key food and the employee or owner who ever it is was very nice and cared about the business i will give him. One other thing is, some of the reviews in here are from the owners im pretty sure, this place does not deserve more then 1 star, and thats for being open.......; The Lady or  Wife who works there never smiles never says Thankyou its like your doing her a favor, (dont like her) if you dont like your job ,hire a happy girl who talks to people.

They now never seem to have enough employees and nobody cares about doing any work. There were 12 people waiting in bottle returns and nobody would empty the machines. We kept calling the store to have someone empty the bins and all they did was go back and shake them and then they kept filling back up and no one would change them. Employees kept walking by and nobody did anything. I asked to speak to the manager at check out and he looked very sloppy and tried to blame it on the machines not working correctly and not enough staff. I can understand if they would have told us that but every time we saw someone they just said we will get someone and never did. I went again a week later and same issue. We also went to self check out and needed assistance and she was no where to be found. When she did come over she was laughing and didn’t care we had to wait. Service hasn’t been good at all lately. They need to make some changes.; I was over-charged twice on two items that were priced differently on the shelf. The self checkout anti-theft AI technology has gotten out of hand and the loud beeps, locking carts, and flagging of cashiers has become an unwelcome nuisance. No one wants to pay to shop where they are instantly an assumed thief, when in reality Kroger is the thief, displaying a different price on the shelf than at checkout. I am extremely happy that I will never have to shop here ever again or endure the embarrassment that comes with being a paying customer with Kroger.; So your trying to hitch up with Albertsons? Albertsons charges premium prices, which is why they're not around here in bay city , I lived in Denver and Albertsons was above my pay grade, so I shopped at King Soopers, which was very similar to Krogers , Save Alot  shopper now

Winslow, AZ when passing through because its not laid out cookie cutter style, it has more of a hometown feel to it with very friendly staff. A big shout out to Dawn and to Mia for being such great representatives in the self-checkout area.
Great customer service speaks volumes! Also, Lindsay with the great smile is a welcomed presence when i see her at the entry.
The store is not cluttered with pallets in the aisles or disorganized shelves, it's like a library EVEN WHILE THE STORE IS UNDERGOING MAJOR INTERIOR REMODELING.
The garden/seasonal area is always full of surprises which i love. The parking lot is super smooth with clearly marked handicapped parking, ADA compliant entryways, shopping, shelves, rest rooms and wide checkout aisles. Restrooms are very clean, nothing looks or feels dirty which is especially a big deal nowadays.
The shelf-stocking crew aren't afraid to leave what they're doing to assist or retrieve items from out back or on a high shelf. The shopping carts are clean and not all wobbly. I'm a big fan of the
self-checkout section vs the conveyor belt and clerk process as bagging my own items is important to me to ensure i have things packed/bagged to travel.
Love this crew, five stars!
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐; The prices are mostly more favorable than in Europe, and what made it a more positive experience was that the sellers could be found in the store and you didn't have to lasso them, like in a Hungarian hypermarket.  There were times when they came to help and give advice without being asked.  In many ways, it is different from Europe, Asia or Africa, but we were not disappointed.; The store is clean. The merchandise is usually in stock, and the staff is courteous and helpful, especially when I can’t find what I want to buy.  Sometimes the produce is moldy, but that occurs at all the other grocery stores in town, and they ask every time I shop for feedback about my visit and occasionally send email surveys for more feedback."

So here's what happened
My wife and I recently gave birth to our 1st child last week Friday so her mom & dad came down from Massachusetts to help us with the baby and stay for a week
I went into 3 sun liquor to purchase two bottles of wine for her parents and 3 nips of rum chatta she was very rude and didn't help me with my wine purchase so I video called my in-laws via Whatsapp to show them the wine selection
After I paid she walks away from the counter so I say excuse me may I please have a bag she then sucks her teeth and says ""you come to a store to shop with no bag! You're supposed to carry a recycling bag"" So I responded very nicely im sorry but I didn't carry a bag so im going to need one . I told her I will pay for a bag she then replies only this time next time bring you're bag with you
After that experience there won't be a next time because she won't get my business ever again; The shop keeper is very rude. I was looking through the chilled wines and she was visibly annoyed and rather than offer to help she told me to close the refrigerator in a very nasty way. As a frequent customer I have never been greeeted or received warmly. I will not be returning. While the selction is decent I’d rather spend my time and money somewhere where customers are appreciated and customer service is provided. It’s a shame because the location is very convenient for me however I’d rather go out of my way for a more pleasant or at least halfway decent experience. I’d advise others to do the same.; I tried to buy a bottle of Marsala for cooking. It came up as $9.79. When I handed over my credit card I was told there is a $15 minimum for credit cards. I asked where the sign was which stated that, the woman told that they don’t have one. I think she was making it up. For what reason I don’t know, she lost a sale and the business lost a customer.
For much better service, better selection and reasonable prices go to the The Wine Room of Forest Hills on 69 Ave between Groton and Harrow."

The experience has always been, seriously so great! I am always greeted warmly by the guys working there, the prices are unbeatable and the fantastic service makes my day!; This review would have zero stars if it could.
I’ve come to this store for years for misc. reasons, but specially for the 2 for 40$ vapes. I get one for myself & one for my wife, every few days, and I only bring my business here. I had an issue with one that tasted burnt out when I got it home to my wife, and all the owner would do is give me 3$ off my next one. Fast forward to now, since last Friday I’ve purchased 3 vapes all not working. & although they lead you to believe that if you try it in the store, if it doesn’t work they will exchange it.. that’s a LIE. This man really said, maybe if you have an issue you should call the manufacturer? They think just because you blow the smoke out, that it’s working fine and doesn’t warrant an exchange. The coil is burnt out!! The products are faulty!! I don’t want no hand outs or freebies I just want the product I’m buying for almost $25 to WORK. & if it doesn’t, swap it. Not even asking for my money back just a working product. The owner will laugh in your face and could care less about your business.. so maybe word of mouth will step on their pockets a little just like they did mine. They treated me like I’m incompetent and delusional.. . It’s truly disappointing.; If you're looking for a wide selection of high-quality spirits, look no further than this liquor store. From rare and hard-to-find bottles to everyday favorites, they have it all.

What sets this store apart is their knowledgeable and friendly staff. They are always willing to offer suggestions and help you find exactly what you're looking for. Their customer service is truly top-notch.

In addition, the store is always clean and well-organized, making it easy to find what you need. And their prices are very reasonable, especially considering the quality of their selection.

Overall, I highly recommend this liquor store to anyone in the area. Whether you're a connoisseur or just looking for a good bottle of wine for dinner, you won't be disappointed with what they have to offer.; Great glass selection. Bought a small glass piece, hard to do, because they had so many nice ones to chose from! I use it everyday and plan to come back and buy more!

On February 3, 2022, my girl and I were headed home and decided to stop at S Mart to grab a couple of things. As we pulled up, the 'OPEN' sign was being turned off. It was just after 10pm and they close at 10pm. We were kind of bummed but sat in front of the store debating where to go instead. Right as I said, ""Well you know he isn't going to let us in there."" The guy that was closing and locking up, waved his hand in a motion letting  us know to come in. He surprised the hell out of me. He could easily have left and not said a word. Instead he had the courtesy to allow us to come in and purchase what we needed. I still can't stop being amazed at this. We live in a time where people rarely go out of their way for strangers and I appreciate his time and kindness. I had never had a bad experience at this store anyway, but that was far from what I expected. On another occasion a few years ago, I needed to use Western Union and the owner was there. He took care of me and told me if I ever was in need of using Western Union in the future. He said that if he was not at the store to have his employee call him and he would come to the store right away to take care of me. Nice guy who obviously hire nice people to work for him. The store is in the parking lot at Los Altos and Vista.; These guys scammed us. They charged us $18 for 6 pack of Long Drinks when it should have been $10-$12. They just lost us as customers for a lousy $6 bucks. Also, their customer service is horrible.

I was checking out. The heavey set blonde haired guy with the long pony tail tried to throw me out of the store and refused to serve me. It was over revealing my personal information to him.

I gave him an old ID. He said,"" I can't used this.""
As I searched foe the current id, I said, ""I would rather you not see my personal information as to why I gave it.""

He looked me up and down rolling his eyes with fury and said, ""I am DONE with you. Get out!"" And took the item from me and would not serve me. ""You can get another to serve you!"" So I tried to reach for the item. He yelled, ""DO NOT TOUCH THAT ITEM!"" And shooed me away from him as if he was a royal and I was a peasant to him. Is he Henry VIII? He sure does act like it.

I had to go back to the isle and get another and then find another associate to help me. It was so embarrassing
The line was full. Nobody in the line spoke up for me. All kept silent and waited to be served by him.

Another woman who was stocking in the rear came up and helped me with no issue and apologized to me. She gave me contact info to file a complaint.

All I did was tell him that I didn't want him to see my personal info while I was searching for the current ID. It was so embarrassing and I will not allow him to serve me ever again.  I will always request someone else as he ordered! I don't obey people like him. I avoid them. DRAMA!; Worst customer service ever.  One guy even said I don't have time to help you.  Online it says Walgreens carries purpose cleansing bar.  They have no clue if they carry it and were unwilling to look.  It was like a scene out of worst jobs ever.; This is the best Walgreens for me, because the staff is actually incredible. I wish I knew their names, but the lady from the east coast in the makeup department is great, the black man as a cashier is so genuine and funny, and the young white gentleman at the photo department was so pleasant. I felt at home and was able to get everything I needed and more on multiple occasions. I didn’t feel rushed, or like I couldn’t enjoy myself at Walgreens services. Maybe I can find their names out and re edit this. Anyway, it’s been like 3 years I’ve been coming here at the employees have really come together at this location, I’m happy for y’all.; I scheduled a COVID vaccination online and when I showed up, they didn't have vaccine. Their online corporate infrastructure is out of sync with the people on the ground. Go somewhere else for services.; Absolutely horrible customer service. Called this morning at 8:30am to have my son's mandatory prescription refilled was told they would have it ready in 2 hours. Got there at 3:45 pm today.  They still don't have the prescription ready. Said I need to come back at 5.
They literally put meds from a bigger bottle into a smaller bottle. What's the hold up?

When I asked if the pharmacist or the pharmacy tech cancelled my order from the doctor she refused to
Answer when o asked who is being held accountable for my heart medicine not getting filled. After I told her that she said it would be ready in 30 minutes. When I walked in to get my med staff were very rude and not welcoming at all. The pharmacy tech rolled her eyes and threw my med on the counter. This is such a horrible place but I go there for the close proximity of my house.; It’s always been a pleasure for me not sure what the problem is. The only problem I have is the drive line is always always very long…. 👍🏼; I went through the drive in to pick up my dietbets medication, employee Michelle at 19th Ave and Baseline location (Phoenix AZ) told me there was a $125 co-pay. The next day I see I was charged the entire ammount $820.66. I called the next day and was told they don't accept my AHCCS/United Health Care Insurance. \n\nNow I don't know how I'm going to pay my mortage and get food if my insurance company doesn't pay me back.; The worst pharmacy never have meds in stock. Lines are ridiculous both drive thru and inside. Will hand you multiple meds without considering give a plastic bag 😤"

Been going to CVS since 1998 and never had a problem. Won't name pharmacy that gave me the wrong medicine that almost killed me CVS pharmacy remembers what your taking and knows if you get a medicine that will interact with your current medication without looking up your profile. Highly recommend.; The worst CVS location. We had appointments for Flu shots and were there 15 minutes before. the lady was nice and wanted to serve us but the guy behind the computer was such a an idiot was saying  yes you have appointments but we can’t serve you for no reason. He said you have to go to the 24 hours location. CVS shouldn’t hire such idiots.; The audacity  of this location at 3440 W Glendale Ave, to treat patients and customers they way that they do.  You call the pharmacy and they refuse to pick up the phone, and when they do, they pick it up ,say nothing and hang up on you.  Today I finally got through, after three tries and a total combined wait time, of 1hr 15min,  she answers without any professionalism at all, takes my info, and then acts like I'm not in the system, and then finds it, and without explanation  or apology  she simply  says , "" they will be ready after 3pm"" and slams.the phone down, basically hangs up on me.  Now I was quite patient and pleasant with her, given I just got out of surgery a few hours prior.  But the audacity  of this center at this location to get away with  treating there customers with hatred, disregard and disrespect for almost three years now, without repercussions from there district manager,  regional or corporate offices is obscene.  Now my employer  uses CVS Caremark for prescription insurance,  and we have no choice but to use their mail service or go into their stores, which is upsetting,  since I have never seen Walgreens treat people the way CVS does, and if I choose  to pick up a script, at Walgreens, CVS will send threatening letters saying they will drop coverage,  it is outlandish  and outrageous  that CVS forces upon their customers  the opportunity  to deal with their unprofessional  employees  at there pharmacy stores.   I have walked into this store and stood in line at the pharamcy and watched their employee's entertain screaming matches  between themselves  and their customers in line, cuss in front of children, let the phone ring and hang up on callers,  not acknowledge customers  existence, and treat the customers  with indifference  and annoyance when assisting them.

I dont understand  how CVS gets away with this. And frankly  if their jobs then they should quit, or get better training, and be held accountable.; On hold for 1 hour waiting for someone to pick up the phone, before they closed at 130 pm. Someone kept putting me on hold.  Still, no one answered the phone.
Was charged for medication I didn't pick up. Still no refund!; Horrific location. Multiple sketchy people walking around peering into car windows that aren’t theirs. Once you get inside and spend 10 minutes waiting in line while 6 employees are making small talk and ignoring customers you’re rewarded with an pharmacist that is entirely ignorant on medication and claims OTC medication requires a prescription."

Clean, great inventory, and nice staff.   Love they carry case quantities out to the vehicle.  All good here.; Big store and a lot of selection. But beware if you are looking for craft beer they have a lot of old stuff. Especially the warm shelf they have beer from some big name breweries that aren't normally available outside of their local area, which is surprising until you look at the can dates on the bottom. A few I looked at would be a huge find if they were fresh, but many cans had canning dates of 6 months ago or more. They obviously don't care they are selling old beer that has turned bad, or they aren't educated and responsible enough to pull it from the shelf. Just irresponsible.

Edit: since I can't respond to the owners response, take a look for yourselves at the dates on the beer. Several Vitamin Sea cans with canning dates from February. Same with Foam Brewing. I'm not making this up folks.; Good inventory and selection. Prices are high, but totally what you would expect at a vacation destination.

My go to store 100%; I dropped in for a cold beverage. The store was organized and clean with stocked shelves. I loved their assortment of snack!  The attendants were friendly with wit.

Small parking lot, but people are in and out with quickness.

Accessible entrance.; Saw that they recently opened this location. Pretty nice and clean store with a decent selection of beers and liquor as well as plenty of snacks. Workers were cool and helpful. Will definitely be going here again 👍; I'm having an absolutely rotten say so I'm not in the mood for more rude| cashiers. I used to be fairly regular before they moved and then I discovered this place had good prices and even more selection.

So I just drove out of my way and discovered the price on the one item rang up substantially higher than expected. (It's also stocked in the wrong spot with no price so there's no way to know in advance.) Based on that I questioned it and asked if it had just gone up recently hoping perhaps there was a mistake.

Where it went off track was with the dismissive attitude and the indifferent shrug at the end. I'm sorry that a 33% price jump is relevant to me. A pretty face behind the counter doesn't make me a moron."

I picked up a medication on a Thursday, was told by the tech my second medication would be ready the next day (because they are always out of everything. What kind of pharmacy is consistently out of a medication?) I call on Saturday to make sure the prescription is ready before I go over to get it, and I'm told there's no record of that prescription.

Getting a migraine while trying to pickup migraine meds. It had already been slow, she herself had been waiting for a while before the issue even arose. It was a hot mess of incompetence and understaffing. The same pharmacist wasn’t adept when they took nearly 10 mins at the pneumatic tube I frequently used, just to ask asking me to go inside because the box wouldn’t fit.
I had gone to drive through without a bra or getting ready, I was beyond frustrated to then go park and go inside, making my trip 90 mins.

All they had to do was discuss this issue in a way that didn’t continue holding up the line of over 16 cars between the lanes. I watched 6 more care get helped while I couldn’t even leave if I wanted, because I needed the medication in real time. All pharmacists in past had no issues and this was the cherry on top after months of progressively crazy, you almost wouldn’t believe it- levels of service. They did this in front of the other cars-when some had been there over 75 mins by that point.  If you have one pharmacist and poor management then don’t bother opening “both lanes”. Not functional in my mind any longer.; Jasmine (with glasses) is the nicest employee of any store I’ve ever been to. She is genuinely kind and not fake nice either. Thank you Jasmine for making my day with your amazing smile!; Lack of customer service here and structure. We pulled up and went into the far lane, literally nobody even acknowledged us. After 10 minutes we reversed and pulled behind the car in the left lane with the window, they left and we pulled up still nobody said anything to us, then a car pulled into the lane and they helped them.

Of course I forgot their names, unfortunately - but it was the guys working on 06.03.24 in Isabela.; If I could give it zero stars, I would. I come here very often as I work a lot of home projects and what not. They take advantage of the fact that they are open til later compared to local hardware stores.

In Puerto Rico Home Depot doesn’t have a generator to run the cash registers. It’s a joke!!!!
Today they were ringing people manually and trying to figure out prices. Hours wasted! First world problems, I know. But this is third world convenience.; The employee Zuelly Hatillo HomeDepot was very very pleasant and helpful. Wonderful experience with her.

They would have saved me a wasted trip.; Drove over two hours from Fajardo, only to be told from a guy guarding the door that the pharmacy closes at 8:00pm.

Everything was super clean and well kept. We also got to meet the Owner, it was his birthday and they had different activities the whole weekend which was a fun surprise! The pool is 24 hours and they have a lobby bar that is also 24 hours. Perfect location, right in the heart of the small town and steps away from the beach. It was the perfect stop for my boyfriend and I on our way down south. The service was amazing and the food was also great! Would definitely recommend.; Making the trip to La Parguera was one of the best choices of our trip, but staying at Parguera Plaza Hotel was the icing on the cake! The staff at the bar/restaurant were so friendly. The rooms were spacious and very clean; the house keeping service did a great job at giving us fresh sheets and towels. The VIEW from the ocean balcony cannot be described in words, so beautiful to wake up to. The location is near all of the restaurants and night life. Although during the weekend the music was quite loud until 1-2 am, it was well worth it to stay at this hotel. If we come back to Puerto Rico, it will be to visit La Parguera and stay at this hidden gem.; Got interior room for a night. Was awesome and affordable, great location and service. Interior room doesn’t have much of the way of windows so it might not be for everyone, other rooms have glass balcony doors. Free parking was very convenient. 24hr pool was excellent, it had a live DJ the night we stayed.  Would recommend and come back.; I can’t recommend it more. Is the nicest hotel in the entire south west area.  Is located in the same Poblado and across from the piers to rent a boat or take a tour. You can walk 10 steps to enjoy the square area and life music during the weekend.

When you arrive at the hotel you feel the breeze of the ocean, is like you are transported to another places. From the lobby you can see the ocean and the pool, where they have 4 cabanas inside the pool. In front they have a lovely restaurant where I eat multiples times and I love the food, the drinks and the friendly services.

The room I ended up staying, was the best one. I arrive with the view to the ocean in the front with a door to the balcony. The balcony is small, but nice. My room was close to the terrace wish is almost private to us.m, the perfect spot for the sunset.

The bed was comfortable and big, the entire rooms were really comfortable and had everything I need.  I was surprise to see a mini bar full of snacks and drinks, it’s not so normal anymore in small hotels. Beach towels and a beach bag was a nice touch.

Hotel Team: Thank you for all the details in my stay and for the amazing upgrade, I feel special  and definitely want to go back. Hopefully for new years to enjoy the New Year’s Eve party.; Had a great experience at Parguera Plaza Hotel. My family and I stayed one night but wish we could have stayed longer. Everyone was SO friendly- front desk staff, barista, bartenders, and waiters. The pool was beautiful and the welcome drink was much appreciated. We had a fantastic breakfast as well.

One minor critique, the barn door closure to the bathroom within our room did not allow for much privacy. There was a sizable gap on each side that we tried to cover by hanging towels."

I feel like a normal person when I go there. Even the security guards are kind.
Everywhere I go where there is security, they seem to have a chip on their shoulder.
If you can get here, get here.; I enjoyed patronizing this dispensary until my experience over this past week. It is important to note that I have spent over $1500 here in the last 3 months. I bought 28 grams just last week for $99 (monthly special). I called the next day to purchase more (because every time I finally find something I like here, it’s magically “sold out or only available in 3.5” the next time I come-terrible sales tactic, by the way); the person on the phone hung up on me when I asked if they had more (my Spanish is perfectly understandable). Next I called a couple more times throughout the week- no answer.

Today, Monday, I went in person and was told there was only 3.5 available and I’d have to pay for each one individually (this is the problem with prepackaging-you don’t know who wants what, how much, when or where). The staff member Queris was able to find 28 grams in the back, but now they suddenly want $140 for the same strain, claiming it’s a different special (same strain, same month).

This is classic bait and switch advertisement and is incredibly illegal. I am not sure if cannabis is something DACO regulates, but will certainly be reaching out with them. The best part was when the worker told me I couldn’t have my phone in my hand as per Salud 😂 (& no, I was not recording, taking pictures or anything and regardless this is otra mentira).

To be noted: there is never any type of supervisor or manager onsite or available in all the times I’ve gone here. I generally know more about the product than who is waiting on me. If the owner is an honest and ethical person, they will reach out to correct this. Sorry I have to give you a 1* review but there is no other way to get through to you, sadly.; Excellent service, amazing customer service from Kiomar B., truly help me find what I was looking for.

Considering most tourist atmosphere have very few choices and all over priced, this place stands out in a crowd.

When visiting Purgatory you don’t only have to order from bar, especially if you like a wide variety of craft beer, although the pic I shared is all my wife’s choices of IPA, they had a great selection and best of all allow you to make your own mix 4 or 6 pack, even taking bottles from new packs.

So far we have visited 3 times and each visit we always have seen the same smiling face behind the counter, and always a pleasure to deal with.

Can’t comment on Liquor as I am drawing a blank, but I do recall tons of wine selections, and little tucked away beer fridge in back offers all the bulk 12 pack traditional selections.; I always love getting wine, beer, liquor, etc. at Mama Clines! She has always been good to me :) Highly recommend when you’re skiing at Purg or in North county!; This place is a lifesaver in North County. I live up here, and driving to Durango to buy beer is not exactly ideal, so it's awesome that I don't have to do so. They have a GREAT selection of beers. I'm pretty particular to IPAs and they typically have six or more different types of IPA alone, though lately I've been sticking to one in particular. Anyway, they have everything else too, from the old timers like Bud and Coors to Sours and everything else that's excellent, that you didn't even know about. I don't who does the ordering, but the guys who work in here have a great handle on which beers are the best to try next if you're just looking to explore. The owner is super nice and lives nearby - pretty much as local as you can get. If you're staying at the mountain, it's well worth it to make the short drive as you'll get a much better selection here than the small liquor store over there.; Mother Cline has beautiful hair and was very helpful with the liquor requests. Thank you for a great experience and for paying so much to be so close!!!!; Favorite liquor store in La Plata County. Such a sweet owner and staff. Always a pleasure seeing them. 10/10 would recommend."

Great experience!; Had my sharpening truck/bus parked smack in front of his business.
I believe he is the owner but if not,  Mr. Owner this nice person deserves a raise.
Honestly I shouldn't have parked there so I could service the Barber College next-door but it was kinda early in the day.
Still, he approached me humbly and kind asking if, will you be parked there very long?""
I assured him that I didn't plan to be long at all.
Since he was so kind and I understood that he needed the 2 spots I had basically encroached on I felt obliged to at least go in and shop.
This is a clean and amply supplied Liquor Store.
Awesome choices of Top Shelf Wine, Liquors (sweet to tongue tied) and Whiskey through Vodka.
I left with a vintage Chardonnay but more importantly, a great appreciation plus ongoing loyalty to and for this little Liquor Store.
Don't take my word for it, see it for yourself!
I promise you will go away with the satisfaction that I felt.

Prices are on par with the big places too – some things even seemed cheaper.; Quick and convenient liquor store.  This place also runs some pretty good sales.  My only complaint is the frequency with which they restock....when they run out of something  (especially wine) it may take them a week or so to restock.; Their staff is amazing and always friendly. They have a great selection and great prices.; The owner of this place is very racist. I was there shopping and walled off due to his comments.

I wasn't even asking for a refund but rather a discount to smooth things over. I suppose losing a customer is worth not giving a one time discount for selling a defective product. Gonna see if I can find a date on the bottles because they were probably expired.  Poor quality control."

Employees are busy chatting without attending to the people in line, or else they also take time to provide attention to each person. It is the only pharmacy where I have seen this problem, at least in Yauco.

Additionally, calls are rarely answered. It was my favorite pharmacy before, I hope they improve in those aspects. DLBM; I took it badly. A recipe. Never. I. They called. They ask for his cell phone number. Then I went to. And they have saved the recipe. It was late. One hour doesn't mean I'd better go wargring. They treat one better. And you.

You can clearly tell every employee here hates their job and will do whatever they can to avoid doing anything beyond standing around.

Like normal stores stock up when your closed. Only one register open, why do they do this as employees watch you like a hawk, so why don’t they just do their jobs after spending the whole time making sure things were paid for. I’m really starting to hate this store.

Auto refills not done. Orders weeks long not filled. When you have chronic serious conditions you rely on them. But i have gone without and with auto refills this shouldn't happen. After YEARS of being a loyal customer,  I'm going to another pharmacy and I will never be back.; I RECOMMEND YOU GO TO ANOTHER PHARMACY FOR YOUR NEEDS. I rarely write these, but this has been the worst pharmacy AND STORE experience I've had. Currently on hold for 57:52 and still holding. After being on hold in the pharmacy for 28 minutes, I called the main number to ask if the store clerk could help me to know, if the pharmacy was even looking at their phone. IDK, I'd, as employee who takes ownership of her job, may take a peek and at least let the customer know how things were going over there. And if pharmacy was not even looking at the blinking hold light on the phone, I wasn't going to hold any longer and would have thanked her for her help. But I didn't have time to finish my sentence before she transferred me to the same pharmacy hold music that I was already listening to on my other phone. I called back hoping this time to finish my sentence. Clerk didn't answer but directly transferred me to the hold music in pharmacy (pretty sure she recognized my caller id number). This rudeness didn't sit well with me. You're not associated with the pharmacy and can't/won't help? Ok, tell me. But. that. no. I called back with the intent to request to speak to a manager, was immediately transferred to pharmacy hold music 2 more times. I called back, and the clerk just hung up on me without a word. I called back and clerk answered. I requested to speak to the manager. She said, ""Sure"", then there was silence. I wasn't convinced I hadn't been hung up on again. Spoke to the manager about the unsatisfactory customer service and rude behavior. No resolution. She just soothed me, the customer by listening. Job done, I guess. Now after 1:11:48 on hold with pharmacy, I'm hanging up and will take my business elsewhere.; Whoever owns this Walgreens, you need to hire more people. Been on hold for 20 min without even talking to somebody to find out why my medication has been delayed for the last two weeks... It's insulin, not something crazy complicated or exotic. If your pharmacy staff is too busy to pick up the phone after 20 minutes, you don't have enough staff.

Update: After 35 minutes of being put on hold without talking to a single person, I found a smaller pharmacy in the area. If your insurance covers it, go to Beewell Pharmacy. Nice folks and they picked up the phone within a couple minutes. I'm transferring ALL of my prescriptions to Beewell Pharmacy now because the corporate monster that is Walgreens has failed me for the last time."

The only problem I have is that they seem to be out of common meds often and have to order them from Phoenix. I started a new med 2 mos ago, and within a week of starting it, one of the pharmacy called to check on me to see if I was doing ok with it. I have NEVER had a pharmacy do that. I really appreciated that.; This Walgreens pharmacy is terrible. Long waits to pick up prescriptions, it takes them forever to fill prescriptions, and more than once the prescription I was supposed to pick up on a specified day has been out of stock on that day. The automated phone system for this pharmacy is also usually grossly inaccurate as far as pick up times. Or it could just be that the staff at this Walgreens pharmacy is extremely slow and fails to meet the estimated times the automated system gives you. Unfortunately it’s the only pharmacy in the Vail AZ area.; Probably the worst Walgreens Pharmacy I have ever seen.  It's always understaffed or closed.  Multiple times I've had major delays in getting prescriptions.  One time I even had to drive to a different Walgreens over 30 minutes away.  I would recommend using a different pharmacy.  I still like Walgreens Pharmacy, just not this one!!; This pharmacy is horrible, our script was put in on Friday the 22nd they told us two hours it would be ready.  We explained we had to go out of town for 3 days and tried to see if we could move the script to a different Walgreens.x they denied that’s.
Coming back 4 days later we went to pick it up after not hearing anything from them. We got there to pick up on the 26th and they told us 2 hours….worst place to go.  This is the worst customer service, the staff is unbelievably rude."

This place was actually a good place to visit though. They do have a wide array of options for people to drink to, and their wine selection was pretty packed.

They were open earlier than the local cidery and brewery nearby, so they were convenient, too. Too bad they didn't carry Locust Cider.; They have a good selection of local beers, wine, and liquor. I got some cider that isn't available in my area and it was very tasty.

That's not to say that you can't get cheaper beers and wines and spirits here if you want that, but there is a solid baseline of quality that I don't see everywhere else. Do you want a good Chardonnay for less than $12? They have them. Do staff recommendations carry weight in your decision-making? These folks are knowledgeable.

Hey, you can buy some beer at grocery stores these days, and I'm all for freedom of choice and convenience, but when we buy alcohol for any occasion - even if that just means enjoying a cold one after yard work - this is the place.

This liquor store was priced fair relative to the secondary market on a lot of their allocated whiskeys and the owner/staff were all very friendly. As you can see from the picture, I picked up several nice bottles including JM cigar blend, all of their staggs (at the time bottles of 23A/23C), OF 1924, michters 2024 barrel proof rye, a few store pics and some other nice bottles. There were many other good bottles like blantons, wellers, Elijah Craig, aged JD, Woodford, whistlepig, etc. They also had a good selection of daily drinkers like OGD 114/BIB, benchmark small batch, early times BIB, OF statesman/100, barrel, very old barton, etc.

All in all, this will definitely be a store I visit more frequently and hopefully this review doesn’t blow up my new spot lol

EDIT: added 2 more pics. The owner and staff are always very friendly.; Visited Phoenix for the first time with the wife. Whiskey hunted solo while the wife was in business meetings.

They had a nice inventory of rare whiskey but out of my price range as they were secondary prices. Had a good talk with an employee about whiskey. Walked out with a Smoke Wagon Malted Rye to add to my inventory back home.; Was looking for something no one had. They were able to find it and communicated quickly and when they said they would.; Excellent store the staff is very knowledgeable about it's products, the staff is always friendly and helpful,  The best liquor store in Tempe; I have ordered from them a few times on Doordash because it's convenient and it's close. I don't know if they can't read or if they don't care about the details but they have sent me the wrong items half the time. And instead of telling me they don't have the item I want available they just pick something without my approval that I don't like and I'm forced to pay for it. ONE star. Not recommended. I would give them zero stars if I could."

If you ask for help they will bend over backwards to help you, and if you make it clear that you would like to browse then they will let you be. It is a rare gift to read other people's cues so well.

Once in a while a very good sales too.; Ive been to quite a lot of Binnys and other liquor stores in the Chicagoland area and after stopping at this one for the first time today, I can confidently say it is my favorite.
Its a smaller store but the selection is far from small and the employees are all very knowledgeable and friendly. Compared to other stores I felt much more welcome at this location (although my experience at other stores was not negative) and every employee I spoke to was able to offer a suggestion, help me out or have a conversation with me about the tasty things I should have on my radar. Great store, great employees and great selection, not much more you can ask for.; Stop by to get water and getorate  guy at register ask me for id for that 😂  i though he was playing around but he wasnt !; I stopped into this location roughly a month ago while I was in the area for some errands. While I had no set intention on purchasing anything specific, I was immediately greeted by a friendly staff willing to help offer recommendations. Jason specifically went more than above and beyond in offering insightful recommendations and meaningful explanations on why he recommended an item. Ultimately I walked out with a bottle of whiskey and then a few bottles of wine I would've never thought to buy on my own. This location was doing a wine tasting later in the day that Jason recommended I come back for to help explore some wines I may have never tried. When coming back again he immediately offered assistance and pointed me in the direction of a few choices that resonated with the information given to him, instead of just a random bottle on the shelf. Both of the wines he pointed to specifically I shared with friends and all parties agreed I made the right choices through Jason. Not only did I benefit twice that day by visiting, but also a few folks around me got to experience the wine and recommendations as well. Wholeheartedly recommend visiting and will return as often as possible.; Not a lot of great stock— but if you’re looking to be racial profiled and accused of stealing, management has what you need.

Shame on this store, Binny’s will never get money from anyone I know, but luckily we aren’t living in 1925 like this prejudice manager. Do better."

But it also means the selection is doubtless regulated by corporate.  So you aren't going to find any rare gems here.  But they do have a good solid selection.  Service is also, well, serviceable.   They do sometimes seem short on staff, but managers are always willing to come up and open a register.  And in these post-COVID days, you can't ask for much more.   Unless you are looking for one of those rare gems, this is a solid choice for beer, wine, or spirits.; Decided to take a ride on the Mta light rail after a walk around the inner harbor and was happily surprised at the variety of IPAs that they have available I should have drove got a few looks on the train with a case of beer but you know what I didn't leave any empties on the train.  Love the selection and staff recommendations; Doesn't deliver.  Hard for folks with walkers or wheelchairs. There is a large Brightview in Hunt Valley, so several hundred seniors are inconvenienced."

There's an on-premise liquor and beer store so you can stock up before you head home (or wherever you're going).

By the way, the pizza place in the shopping center is really good.
The Original Giorgio's; Went here for the first time in years. Service was good but not many people there. They used to have bands  and were jam packed.

Go Thursday, Friday, Saturday  and tell them Maddog sent you from Google.  Good food coming after the remodel; Moved back home this past year and needed a new liquor store close by;
had a drink while I was there  and met some lovely people too! Bartender was speedy and good conversation on the side.

So happy!; Thanks for he last minute Birthday delivery with the sweet note! She loved it! Great job!; This store is one of the best new additions to the northland.  I was blown away by the craft beer selections, I felt like a kid in a candy store!  As I stood there, unable to decide on what to buy (I wanted them all) the owner asked me if he could be of any help.  The best part was that he explained he could order anything I wanted that he didn't have in stock. I felt like I was in my own little piece of beer heaven.  I was also stunned at how low the prices are considering how top notch the choices were.  Equally impressive is the wide variety of wines, bourbons, whiskeys, vodkas......the list goes on and on.

When we came back to our car there was a note saying we would be fined 250$ if we did not enter the gift shop and pay for parking. We thought it was a mistake so we headed inside and asked and they said the kiosk across the street was “part of the government” so we would have to pay again. We asked for a manager and she repeated the same thing. She said it was our choice that we paid and we had the choice to not pay the parking again. When asked if we could get a refund since we could chose to pay the fine, she said “Sure but you MIGHT get fined” we paid the 25$ to avoid problems and left. Manager gave us sooooo much attitude the whole time and threatened us.

We immediately returned it with our dated receipt to exchange it and the staff insinuated that we didn’t store the wine properly. They went on to say “no exchanges.” They have free rein to sell bad products and won’t take responsibility for it!!! DO NOT buy their wine. They are the only store in town that sells it, so if you are a wine drinker please make other arrangements. Extremely poor business practice.; Cool little shop.

They are the most expensive liquor store in Cromwell or Middletown. Go down the street to liquor world. Or take a turn, go down East Street, and save even more money at the Spirit Shop. Didn't Willowbrook just sell their wooden shanty town for 2 million dollars? Do they really need an extra 2 or 3 bucks from you?; New ownership. Did some nice remodeling inside, changed the carpet, built a new countertop for sales. What’s really wonderful is that they significantly expanded their selection of local craft beers which is a huge draw to this establishment.; Immediately profiled and the guy went the extra mile to hound the person i came in with and then made the point to be "" kind"" and hold the bottle i had in my hand up front u until i was done shopping. 1st time i let it slide but not twice.; Willowbrook used to be my go-to store for beer. They had shelves full of interesting craft brews, but over time they’ve reduced their selection. What was once four shelves is now one.

I’ll poke my head in every so often, but the selection seems less interesting than it once was.

Edit: I visited again recently and the beer selection seems sparse more and more frequently. I’m leaving my review at 3 stars, but Willowbrook has nothing to differentiate itself from dozens of other liquor stores."

Kudos for taking care of customers.; Impressed by the selection of bourbon, whiskey, voodka, beer, wine, vapes, you name it all. Good customer service and affordable price for a locally owned package store. My go to place for now on; This store provide excellent customer service. They are always willing to help make your experience easier. Love shopping here.; My first time shopping here and I love it; The prices are inflated (as to be expected from a small package store), but I've seen worse. They make up for it by being very friendly and always asking how your day has been going. I appreciate that."

Update: They're still the best place to go! like I mentioned before they have great staff and if you're looking for a particular type of beer they'll Look into finding it for you. great smiles, great prices, a wins a win.; Overall a very nice place...  I visited on a recommendation from a coworker No hours of operation posted anywhere outside that i could find. The exterior windows are cluttered with all sorts of advertising in the ,window which made me a little apprehensive about going in... Once inside, I was surprised that they were clean. I was greeted promptly. I am not a drinker so I can not review pricing or selection of alcohol, but they seem to have great selection. Now for the cigar review...... They have a small walk in humidor that is packed with all different kinds of cigars. They are reasonably priced and offer a 25% DISCOUNT on Sundays from noon until midnight. They have glass jars on the counter of cigars that are infusing with various flavors.  I would have to say stop out and check them out, especially in Sunday's.; Prices are higher than the real ABC but they have great personalities when you go in great service it gets what you need done and they're open late; Been coming here for a long time.  This place offers a vast selection.  Friendly and polite, the people who work here know their alcohol and would be happy  to help you select a bottle.

Not sure how this place has such good reviews. 🤔; I have been here twice now and found beer that I wouldn't normally find in a grocery store. There is a good selection of alcohol and some you won't find in the state run ABC stores. I bought a six pack and didn't realize until I got home that one of the cans had an issue but rest were all right. You couldn't tell unless you looked at the bottom of the box. I know going forward to check before leaving the store.; great place ! I have tried to get my hands on eagle rare bourbon since so long. but yesterday i got a call from hilltop that they have bottle of eagle rare set aside for me! the staff here is very friendly . I also got a bottle of the four roses bourbon on the recommendation of staff. Me and my husband really loved it! great selection of bourbons !Must pay a visit!; Great Whiskey/Bourbon selection, friendly staff. Their great selection can probably be attributed to the price gouging though, selling Blanton's at $175 is a bit blatant (pun intended) on the price gouging. Also another bourbon, Dettling Single Barrel cask strength, that sells for roughly $80-$90 was selling for $135.

Nevertheless, if you're really looking for something and don't mind overpaying a bit you'll likely find it here."

They're always super nice to me and I don't like going elsewhere! Awesome addition to the shopping center.; It is a State liquor store. It's clean, friendly, quick to get through, and expensive as all-get-out.

It's really the only option: non-State liquor stores in Alabama have to buy wholesale from the State stores.

The man working helped me immediately, and when I told him what I was looking for, he was able to very quickly recommend two fantastic bottles both to suit my price point. He gave me a quick briefing on each bottle along with the prices, with which I was pleased!

As I was checking out, he took that time to explain to me how the place works. In addition to a great selection of wine, they also have very good service. One thing that the man mentions was that the wines in this store are guaranteed to be the lowest prices in the area, so my ear immediately perked up.; Can you buy alcohol on Sundays here"

If you happen to be in West Mobile, check out this store for you alcohol needs.; They have a wide selection of drinks and the prices are ok. They sell cigars but it's a very small selection and a big problem is that all the cigars are dry. They must have a problem with their humidor or its not set to the right humidity.
TLDR: Good selection of alcohol; Bad selection of overpriced dry cigars.; Needed a quick refill for some surprise guests and popped in to find everything I needed.

If you are looking for a vermouth that has pronounced vanilla notes or is cinnamon forward, when you need a bourbon that you cannot get anywhere else, a gin from Sweden or France, this is the place to go and find it.

Great store, has all kinds of oddball liquers, bitters, etc which are harder to find around here. Went to three different stores looking for PF Dry Curacao before finding it at LeNell's.

You can even sample bitters there! Will definitely be back.; Wasn't there long but long enough to see she is a cool beans type of lady. She gave me a lil course in bourbon (Ky girl here). The boutique has a nice laid back atmosphere. I know where my husband's Christmas present will come from.; This is the best package store in the south, if not one of the best in the country.

Or were not even wearing one. The security guard wore his mask around his chin...while he bought lotto tickets and made us wait! He gave a teen boy a hard time for not having a mask and told him to keep his shirt over his mouth and nose. But every woman that walked in without a mask, or a mask around their chin, he flirted with. We live down the street and will not ever go back unless the owners crack down on this.

Backstory 12-31-23

I had called their location looking for a specific alcoholic beverage but didn't get an answer, as it was one of the busiest Holidays of the year....New Year's Eve. In the mess of calling multiple other places to try to find it (with no luck and losing hope) I got a call that I didn't recognize. I noticed it was the same area code as some of the numbers I had been calling though, so I answered it. Despite the EXTREMELY busy holiday they called back to find out what I needed! 🤯  On top of that they had the beverage that I had been so desperately searching for and it was the LAST bottle they had!! It was quite a bit out of the way (20 mins off the highway) but when I got there it's like they knew who I was. 🤯
I hadn't even said a word, I had just walked in the door and they pulled the beverage from behind the counter and held it up high then put it down on the counter for me. In shock I said to them ""How did you know it was me?! They replied with a shrug that they just knew. This was very impressive as they had tons of customers coming and going so it was so crazy they knew it was me upon arrival.
That was SO incredibly awesome that they called me back and held the beverage for me. This was a very sought-after and limited edition beverage so they definitely didn't have to, and could have sold it to anyone. I am sure the story I told them of what had happened earlier that day was a factor but none the less I was ever so grateful.
(What I shared with them ----> I told them how it was my Birthday. That I had been looking forward to trying the Old Smoky Mountain Mint Chocolate Chip Flavored Whiskey because it's my favorite ice cream flavor and I love anything mint/chocolate. I continued telling them how I had dropped it as I was leaving to the celebration I was going to. I almost cried as I saw it shatter on the cement and spill out. 🥺 I told them how I had called nearly every place that sold alcohol between Grand Rapids and Detroit with no luck.) They said they were glad to be able to help me.
Anyway, I wanted to make sure they were given a shout out because the negative is usually what's focused on and these types of stories usually go untold or only told to a few. Exceptional customer service is truly hard to find, as is good people so definitely check this place out if you're ever in the area because they definitely deserve your business.

Photo of beverage below :); This is a very special place whether for top craft breweries (visit the cave!) or fine wines, ports, single-malt whisky. Service is superior in every way.; On The Rocks (OTR) is the place to go when it comes to Spirits.   I walked in and was greeted by the owner who was pleasant and very knowledgeable in all aspects of Bourbon.

I had been asking a liquor store in Owosso, for a few bottles that they have yet to obtain.  At OTR they not only had them but also introduced me to a few other items that are outstanding!

If your in the area stop in and if there are any bottles left of OTR’s Backbone Bourbon they was bottled for them grab, you’ll be very satisfied!; A friend recommended I check out On The Rocks for their selection and I’m so happy I did! Wine, liquor, craft beer selections are all amazing (I even got a fun flavored sparkling wine I’ve never seen before and it was a great price). They absolutely have the biggest hard seltzer selection I’ve seen anywhere. I saw brands I’ve never heard of and tons of flavors.

The staff is also so kind and willing to help. My partner was having a hard time picking out items and instead of rushing him or pushing our stuff out of the way, the staff opened a second register just to give us space and help us. Above and beyond!; This place is freaking AMAZING! Literally floor to ceiling alcohol and a beer cave so packed you have to tip toe around.

They are extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and VERY friendly.
This place is better stocked than Oades and they price everything at state minimum.

They are my new go to for anything alcohol related."

Updated review per request 2.8.2023:  Pretty much the same as last time except the selection of Founder's beers was minimal. Only a few in the refrigerated section and no packs on shelves. It's my favorite so I was kind of sad. 😔; Great selection. Please add more cashiers during busy periods, such as the time when most people get off work. There were two lines of over 10 people each.; I love coming here, their selection is amazing. Wall to wall liquor from all over the world. They have everything that you could think of or want. The even have a tasting here. They carry snacks drink additions like olives, cherries, onions, rum salt, sugar, lemon & lime juice, bitters etc...  as well as carrying cases, and drinking glasses. If you open up an acct. with them they will send you coupons for discounted items. So sign up with your cashier. If you've been looking for something that a lot of other stores may not carry, you will have a good chance of finding it here."

Why? I was greeted at the door by a pharmacist saying to me in high volume... ""HAVE YOU HAD YOUR FLU SHOT YET?""

UPDATE: I up'd my stars from 1 to 3 because of how awesome and kind the operations Manager was over the phone. Thank you for listening. I understand  corporate decisions are out of your control. The way he handled my call was supremely balanced. Thank you for pointing me in the right direction.; Unfortunately they were understaffed, so our 3 mile drive was a waste as they didn't have any hot deli food that we went there for. I hope they can hire better staff soon for their own sake. The Mgr said they had a lot of call outs today. Other than that, it was clean and well stocked.; I love the Walmart Neighborhood Markets. They are much smaller than the Super Centers Walmart's but has everything I need. Never too crowded, parking close to the store, staff friendly, never more than one person ahead of me in line. Also has self-service checkouts and handi-cap parking. In and out fast. What's not to like? I recommend it.; My pickup experience today was wonderful!

I had ginger crepes mmmmmm!; We happen to find this place by accident driving through the mountains of Orocovis. It was a nice pitstop having lunch overlooking the mountainous landscape. It was appreciated that the sandwiches were made with multi grain bread, and the natural juices were great. In addition, they had a small designated area displayed with artisan crafts to purchase as well as t-shirts of the business. The only setback is that there is a very limited and cramped parking area.; The atmosphere was great, it was very comfortable and good vibes giving. The food is somewhat bad. The drinks were awful, no other words needed. I have come here on multiple occasions with many people and weren't positive either.; Awesome little spot we stumbled upon on our way to Toro Verde. The latte and cake was fantastic. The rear balcony has a great view and the staff was extremely friendly. They even have a little spot to pick up some souvenirs. Definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area.; When I say they have everything you want for you coffee and more, I mean it. Fresh pastries, service is fast and attentive, food is delicious and the location feels like that cozy cabin you’re looking to stay in while you’re in the mountains. 10/10 highly recommended!"

I’m on my 3rd Order. I made it a point to order at least once a month; I was very pleased with the quick delivery and excellent packaging to insure my order was not damaged. I understand the secondary market, but wish more online retailers would sell products closer to actual retail price. I have found some retail stores within a 30 mile radius of my home that have a pretty consistent stock of Buffalo Trace products at the actual retail price. I would order a lot more product from you if the pricing wasn’t so inflated. Overall, my purchase experience was very good.; I'd prefer to give zero stars but you must to leave a review.

The ""order"" hasn't moved in days. No shopping company name to even look. Shop tracking still has the order ready for carrier to pick up.; Everything worked out perfect. Was very pleased with overall quality of service.Was somewhat reluctant at first after reading some of the reviews but the great price compelled me give them a try.
And have just now placed my second order.; I’d read some of the other reviews so was nervous about buying online, but saw they had a hard to find foursquare run. Placed order at 250pm Wednesday, and totally surprised when the package arrived at 350pm Friday (from San Diego to San Francisco).

A word about those who complain that this shop is overpriced:
1. These guys pay usurious rental rates that a mall charges. You, the customer pays more for convenience.
2. There are other cigar shops, but the distance to San Juan nullifies whatever price advantage you might realize.; Friendly service but overpriced cigars. Not bad for Puerto Rico though.; Over price
returns are impossible
I would never go back to those scam artist
$70 for a $25 vape; I love it here because theres alot of e juice and mods; Great place to get cigars if you ever visit Puerto Rico 😀"

When i finally got my medication open the bag the lot number that they supposed to write on the medication bottle was missing. I called their supervisor she apologized and said she will have a meeting about the lot numbers ect. The second time was few days ago and was even worse the employee at the register asked for my phone number 6 times she kept looking at her watch because she was ready to finish her shift not paying any attention to her duties. On her way out she said twice that my medication was done but it wasn't i waited about 2 hours for my medication. When i got home guess what open the bag no lot number written on the bottle again.

If you just need to leave a prescription you have to make the same line for everything. You loose so much time!  Bad service...; My father is almost 90 yrs old and they give him a herd time with his prescriptions he calls and they will not answer their phone.

I'll definitely go back when I'm back in the area.; I don't always leave reviews but I had to take a moment here. I was hesitant to order from Rancho Liquors after seeing a number of poor reviews from their online sales. That being said I'm glad pulled the trigger - they were able to fulfill my order quickly and without any hassle whatsoever.

I did take a moment before ordering to call and see if someone would physically check if the rum I was looking for was on the shelf and available to ship. Nicole happily did this for me and was very friendly about it. She was super helpful and I received a FedEx tracking number from CA to NY within hours of that phone call after placing my order. Honestly I'd always call first to insure the availability of what I'm ordering, I wouldn't hesitate to order from Rancho Liquors again though.

Exceptional service, and I thank all of the staff for a great experience."

Avoid this store and shop anywhere else!! The owner is rude and when u show him another store price he will tell u to your face he doesn't care.

I Thank God this was not a life of Death situation,  I then had to call my Sister back home to have her over night us the syringes.

Visited the shop after spending the morning exploring El Yunque and taking the kids ziplining. Great selection of souvenirs from magnets, hats, shirts, bags, local hot sauces, sugar, coffee and cigars!
The shop was clean, neat and organized. The young man working there was very helpful and willing to answer all the questions we had. Helped me pick out a great cigar and I will be ordering more online.
I can't recommend this shop enough. I know my family and I will absolutely be back next time we go to PR.; Perfect place to stop by and get your family and friends some gifts! They have from pencils to homemade hot sauces. I love that they have a tasting station to try the different variety of sauces. They also have a coffee station to try they delicious coffee. I had to buy some coffee before I left.  I personally think all the sauce were super spicy, but that’s definitely an individuals’ choice. The owner/manager was super friendly. They have a photo prop so you can have fun while other shop. It’s hard to miss. It’s located in Rio Grande!; Found great gifts here! Little pricey compared to other gift shops on the island. However this particular shop had sections with local hand made items which I thought was really cool. The young gentleman was also very helpful, and kind. Gave us recommendations for restaurants nearby and was very kind."

I live close and it's mostly my store of choice when I have to resupply on first necessity items, and mostly anything else that is not a major purchase. I get good deals on brand names.
The employees are very attentive and friendly, wich is another reason why I like to visit this store.
I'm so glad this store is in my vecinity, I can even walk from home when I have to.
I save money and get what I need!; While on vacation decided to buy beers and few things to have at our hotel room. At the register the cashier ask for my ID because of the beer, which I provided. She then ask for my wife ID as well. We ask why and she said that according to Walgreens policy all people in the party must provide ID. Since our plan was to just do a quick stop and I was the one driving my wife did not brought her ID. I though the cashier was kidding but after scanning everything she refuse to charge the beers. Ask to speak with the Manager and Vicente Ramos, Assitant Manager, shows up. He told me exactly the same as the cashier. I explained to him the situation and also that policies are guides that are made for a particular reason and that he can clearly see that my wife is not a minor. Managers should exercise proper judgment in this kind of situations.  He kept his mind set to not allowing me to by the beers and strictly said that is was policy and that he could not do anything about it. That I could call Walgreens customer service to complain, which I did after heading out. After speaking with representative from Walgreens customer service it turns out that is was exactly like I was telling him, that policy states that they only ask for IDs of all party members if they suspect one of them is a minor. More so their policy says that if one of the person do not have the ID they can just provide verbally their birth date. Customer service told me that the store manager, Madeline Rivera, will call me to apologize for the bad experience Vicente create yesterday (really hope she call). I do not understand why managers instead of using policies to guide them and made customers feel safe for shopping there, turns out they use them to make customers experiences difficult and unpleasant, which at the end will turn customers away. Also if you are going to enforce a policy make sure you understand it well because it seems in this case that they didn’t even read it completely or this experience will never had happened.  Hope this store correct this situation because the actions of Vicente could keep turning customers away from their doors.; Clean location and friendly staff. Conveniently located off the main highway and right next to plenty of eating options. Their souvenir section is less than desirable. However, overall 5 stars!; :P The cashier was so rude while ringing up my purchase.. grabbing everything roughly & slamming items in the grocery bag after scanning them. I literally asked her if she was ok, or having a bad day.. she replied with ""im having a good day, thanks.. i just hate my job!"" wow! Someone there pissed her off. :( SMH; Touch tone options don’t work. You get stock in a loop repeating and repeating. I am out of state trying to ask a question for pharmacy.

The same two brothers with poor judgment accused my water bottle from king soopers of being a product of theirs in my jacket pocket I promptly pulled it out and to my surprise they still insisted something was in my pockets. Even after being profiled and watched through the whole store I was about to pay when the brother started being rude. I got upset and said never mind. When i began to walk out the brother blocked the entrance demanding to see my pockets i pulled everything out fast since it was only wallet and phone. He said get out of my store like i wasnt already trying to. Worst service made me feel like horrible when i bought sometuing yesterday.  So as a tip. Dont show up with a hoody or a water bottle. This is not a high crime area for this to make sense.. just completely stereotyping the way I dressed. I was riding for hours on my motorcycle. Shame.; The coward won't except the court orders for being a thief and cannot repay the loan for his house and store please reconsider ever shopping hear 🤔; Great selection of beer, wine and liquor.

I am not one who drinks tequila; however, it caught my eye long enough to add to cart.; The name says it it all. They have a bit of everything. Prices vary from rare to regular.😉 They have a feature tasting center and a classroom for classes. The have shelf stuff and cool cases. Soooo much to see ...so much to try."

I don’t live close to this place but now I will be making special trips for the great selection and the beers on tap.   You can have samples and if you wish then you can get a growler to go.   They currently have 3 different Goose Island beers on tap and that was a A+ move on their part along with 3 other beers to try.

All liquor is stored behind a long counter to the left when one enters the store. Liquor is stored up to the ceiling which made it hard to find brands and prices. The prices seemed high so I did not buy anything rather, I went to Albertsons Grocery across the street where I had bought scotch last year. The price I paid was $8.00 less than this location. It was recommended by an Albertson's shopper to go to Lee's Discount Liquors on Rainbow St. so I will try there for buying my higher-end scotch gift purchase soon.

Worth ever single penny. Mever had a better experience with my favorite past time in my life. These really work! Ive tried and love them all!

Highly recommend.; You can find some great deals at this store if you’re a regular. The prices for allocated Bourbon and Tequila are perfect for travelers staying on the strip. It’s a quick Uber ride away and will save you a few bucks compared to strip prices. Mark is the owner and works most week days. He’s very friendly and treats regular customers very well. Lately, the store has had some amazingly delicious store picks.; The store has a lot of products packed into a smaller space making it feel tightly packed or closed-in. Although, that impression could be the result of me usually shopping at Lee's. The employees were nice and the store was clean. The prices are more expensive than Lee's, so I'll only go back for particular items when I can't find them at my usual place. All in all, a decent choice for a liquor store."

Most of the time the thi g I need can't find they don't have it should have it but don't. Or I notice. The more expensive product will be the only one out so you gave to buy it which ain't right alot of us are on budgets and budget our grocery's to find out we always have to spend more ain't right ain't right. They need a new person that orders the merchandise this one is no good. It's been going on for a long time now n aint right.; Says they close at 11pm. I rushed here after work. Got to the door at 10:52 and I wasn't let in. I need 3 items for dinner. I can do the shop quickly but if you are going to stop letting people in at 10:50, post that you close at 10:50, so that I don't waste my time and gas. I live in AZ city, it's a big deal; We had a pretty bad experience with Wal-Mart yesterday. My wife made an order for pickup. When she got home, she was missing 10 items. She tried calling them for over 30 minutes with no answer to let them know so we could come back to pick them up. When she finally got ahold of someone on the phone, the young lady was rude and throwing attitude. We got back to Wal-Mart and had needed to grab a few things in store and needed 2 items off the top shelf. My wife asked an employee walking by for help and the lady said she didn't speak English and could not help us and walked away. We then asked this other lady for help, an older lady, and she looked like she didn't know what to do. She walked down the isle to another woman and spoke to her and still no help. The older lady returned back to us and said she would get someone. 10 minutes goes buy and still nobody. We eventually stood on a box and got the items ourselves. I hope the store Manager gets this review and trains the employees on customer service and how to do their job."

Which I do every two weeks at the nearest Walgreens location.
This is the only time I had a problem.
Chime has a load limit of 1000 per day, which you have to do as two separate transactions.
The manager told the cashier it was a 750 limit. I advised that I am pretty sure it's 1000 and the manager replied back in a cocky manner I'm pretty sure it's 750 and just walked away. As I complained to the associate that this was the only Walgreens I had a problem with he said well there is two other ones you can go to.
So if the limit is 750 then why was I able to go to another Walgreens and load the remaining 250 onto my card?
Talk about not being treated as a valued customer.
I would not recommend going to this Walgreens.
The one on Dobson and Main is better and they treat you with respect and dignity.; Pharmacy is the laziest people ever. No phone call or anything just cancel a prescription sent to them without an explanation. DO YOU'RE JOB!!! It's not rocket science putting pills in a little bottle is not the only thing that comes with the job customer service and actually talking to people is part of it too.; The clerk Jason had both register systems lock up on him. I set my stuff down on one side of the counter. He begins to yell at me screaming at me to leave. Saying not to throw my stuff down. In front of other customers and his coworkers. Turns and screams at shamaya. Jason, you need to learn to take a break and step away from everything, and just breathe. It's not that Serious.  Chill out. I really hope your single otherwise I feel sorry for your wife. And you should be a lot more careful who you speak to like that, I'm surprised no ones put you in your place.; My 16-yr-old-child (who is on the spectrum and wandered away from his bus stop) came into this store today (3/5/24) and they called the police on him! He thought he was supposed to buy adult diapers for his grandpa, who is now deceased. He once went there with his 'paw-paw' and was having an episode and became confused as to why he was there. So Walgreens, in their touching concern, called the police to arrest him! My question to Scottsdale's finest when they phoned me: ""so Walgreens called YOU on him but not only was he NOT stealing but also NOT bothering anyone or destroying any property?"" Police-woman to me: 'I guess so"".

So I'd like to thank the wonderful staff who worked there around 3-4 pm today for thinking the kids of color who come into your store and wander around are there to steal something. (P.S. He had his youth debit card on him that we gave him so was going to make a purchase, that is why he was there.) His disability made it hard for him to focus and choose without his parents there to help him but I do so THANK WALGREENS staff present for being such racial-profiling chicken-craps that my child scared you into phoning the law to help with the no crime in progress. I am sure you were in such peril!!! It is 2024 and you are so deficient and poorly trained in customer service that it never occurred to you to ask him if he needed any help? Just call the cops on a whole kid, right? Now, he is very traumatized cos he does not understand what he did wrong and keeps crying about the police coming to arrest him. Thanks for that. No wonder I prefer CVS. You truly suck and I hope your own kids experience paid adults being too dumb in their own establishment to note YOUR child's distress but instead call the cops on them! You'll enjoy that.; This Walgreens Pharmacy is by far the worst, all employees are rude as hell and when your meds are suppose to be ready, you go to pick it up and they look and talk to you like your a liar. Y’all need new employees and pharmacist. Don’t call just before their lunch break they’ll keep putting you on hold until they go to lunch. Pathetic!"

Let me start by saying the food was amazing. We ordered the French toast breakfast sandwich and it came with fries. There is definitely leftovers for lunch and not too sweet. We also ordered the tripleta and it was delicious 🤤

The young lady at the register leaves much to be desired. Very dry and doesn’t seem to want to be there. As much as we loved the food, we won’t return with someone like that at the counter. Smile more, your day will go by faster and might be more pleasant.; First I was not greeted whatsoever by the cashier as she was too busy chatting on her cellphone and just handed me a menu. My husband and I wanted breakfast and arrived at 11a and she proceeded to tell us they were not serving breakfast. So, my husband order white rice with red beans, and steak and I had maduros and tostones which were cold and old with a orange squeezed small juice of which I was charged $6.50 and total came out to $21 definitely was overcharged for the horrible food and service! Don’t bother!!! Not a typical boricua hospitality; Is rare that I genuine like someone else’s cake. However I must say I loved the cake prepared by El Ancla Bakery. The owner has a hand for desserts and the cake typical of Puerto Rico. The cake was perfect in texture truly perfect. And it was not super sweet or soaked in a overly flavored syrup. It was spongy, soft and with very delicate and fine crumb. Recommended. Plus the prices are very affordable. If you want to know what I am talking about they also sell pieces of the cake. You can try what is a very good genuine Puertorrican cake at El ancla.; 3rd time at this place, today I had lunch for the 1st time. Went in looking for sushi as advertised, but got a tasty and fresh lasagna instead stuffed with ground beef, ricotta, and cheddar cheese inside, with melted mozzarella cheese on the outside; complimented by fried plantains for $13 dollars. The bakery is very clean and of modern design with the classic amenities expected from a bakery that offers breakfast and lunch. Pastries are diverse and  beautifully decorated. Fresh ingredients are key to fabulous food and pastries confection at this bakery. On the other hand I was disappointed with customer service. The 1st time, unlike today, I felt welcomed. Local customers support local businesses throughout the year, and attention to customer service is imperative for business growth. As a Google guide interested in promoting our local businesses, for the 1st time I identified as one and asked permission to take photos of the pastries and the food to be respectful, but was told in a unfriendly way that the photos and menu were already posted, only to find that photos were 26 days old; so I didn't take any photos as for my visit today. Today, the cashier was too busy looking at TV while I was asking for lunch, and the 2nd visit cashier was too busy talking to another person while I'm finalizing a purchase. Food , pastries, and coffee are really good. I'm sure they can improve customer service.; Amazing Food! But the Lady in the front is very rude and bad customer service.

Donuts that are as soft as a pillow, excellent local coffee and even low-carb options for those looking for a guilt-free dessert, it's all there.

Few places have a great combination of food, quality, presentation and variety, but this one has it all. Staff is kind, friendly and willing to fill you in on all the sweet details to ensure you get the donut that's for you. You can feel the enthusiasm for what they do. Take a look at the attached pictures and you'll see they pay attention to both the donuts and how they are presented. Upon entering the shop you are greeted by a beautiful display, containing those sweet carbs. To the side are donut cups and other things that truly pull you into the experience.

Now let's talk about the donuts, which do I recommend? Honestly, start with the basic glazed donut. Have a bite of that and you'll understand why I recommend this place. Just the right amount of sweetness, fresh dough and soft to the touch. I'd also highly recommend the maple bacon donut for that balance between sweet and sour.

I will absolutely make this a regular stop whenever I'm nearby Fajardo, because I have to try out all their other flavors!; Crazy For Donuts is a cute donut and coffee shop. The owner is very welcoming and friendly. My friend told me that the maple glazed bacon chocolate donut was very good. I tried the pistachio donut, which didn't taste like natural pistachio. The base of all the donuts are the same; a soft raised donut. The hot chai latte was rich and creamy. Keto diet friendly donuts available.; The donuts are beautiful and tasty and they serve coffee too! Sergio was so nice and friendly and made my donut for me even though it wasn't in the case.; Really tasty donuts that are made fresh to order! Very well priced too! Owner and staff are very friendly and helpful with their advice on which donuts to order. They have the usual classics and then donuts with fillings and/or toppings.; Donuts made fresh! Inside  waiting area available. It was hard to decide because everything looked so delicious. I will be back to try the strawberry."

Considering there is an entire apartment complex across the street, you would think they may have some consideration some people have work early  the following day and do not want to be harassed by the thudding bass emanating from their very small bar. This place isn't a lounge or a sleek club that it should even entertain the idea of having a DJ, yet it does. Honestly sick of this place.

***Update***
Still loud, now it's getting to be at least twice a week where I have to hear this bar's loud music OVER my television. In regard to the ""response"" I received for my review...there is no reason for me to stop by to discuss whatever concerns I have. All I want is some consideration for the people who live in close proximity to your bar. There is no reason why you should be blasting music at 12 AM in the morning.  My review states what my issues are.; Went here a bunch of times, but one evening the clerk took my fiancee’s ID and would not give it back insisting it was fake. He then called the police on her, who came and confirmed it was a legitimate ID. Will not go back.; The liquor store guy is shady. Twice I have been in there and both times he tried to short change me. I just can't spend my money in an establishment like this. Be aware!; I like the place met alot of nice people there got like a second family I also worked there and the boss sunny was great"

Give him a raise . A substantial raise. He is an employee that every company wishes they could have.

The store is clean and well stocked and they have a good selection of makeup and hair products.; The staff at this location have a bad attitude in the pharmacy. The person that checked me out was nice and helpful (during this visit) but I could hear the staff member attending the drive-window telling-off a customer. It’s was shocking. They were saying, “Is that it, because every time I walk away you need something else. So, tell me now so you don’t do that again.” It was really clear by her tone that she was angry and irritated with the customer. It was really awful to hear her speaking to someone that way. Even if the person was being annoying it’s the staff’s job (literally) to be patient and help. It’s not the first time this has happened. I have been on the receiving end of the pharmacy staff’s bad moods a few times. I was in the drive-up doing a PCR test and forgot to put the paperwork in the bag for the lab. I went into the store to give it to them and the staff member scolded me and said, “that’s supposed to go in the bag” with a super shard tone, and was rude and really disrespectful. I’ve had interactions with the manager who is just overly talk-y and asks too many personal questions and is then rude and weird if you don’t want to engage in business in that way. It’s like the staff is just angry and bitter all the time and they are going to make sure you know how irritated they are with you. CVS seriously needs to retrain the pharmacy staff. It’s a terrible experience dealing with them. And seriously, people that are picking up medicine have all kinds of issues that they are dealing with and not feeling well or have sick family and do not need to be treated poorly by a bunch a discontent, impatient, disaffected staff. If it’s too hard to do the job of interacting with the public they should get another job where compassion, empathy, maturity and professionalism is not required. CVS you need to do better.; Greatest cvs pharmacy went to doctor and send my medication cvs pharmacy on Van buren & Avondale and my prescription was ready like in 10 minutes.; The drive thru is limited to one line, so it usually takes a while to get through.

If you choose to shop here, be prepared for incredibly poor service. On my most recent visit, I waited in line for 30 minutes, only to have the cashier close the register just as it was my turn. With only two lines open and a large number of customers, it was evident that the staff were in no rush to assist anyone. This isn't an isolated incident—I've faced similar issues every time I've come here.

Expect long waits, unhelpful staff, and a general lack of consideration for your time and needs. Despite giving this store multiple chances, the service has never improved. I have decided to take my business elsewhere and advise others to do the same. Until this location seriously addresses its customer service and staffing issues, I cannot recommend shopping here.; I purchased several items today (7-13-24) for a boat day. After eating almost all of one of the dips, we noticed it was separating oddly. I checked the expiration date and realized it was two days ago. Not sure why they thought it was acceptable to leave this on the shelf and sell it to me.; I was in the store July 5 at 4PM.  Terrible experience. Understaffed to put it mildly. Waited at the deli for 10 minutes.  No one to help. Asked staff in prepared foods for help. She said they were poorly staffed. Asked to see manager. Never showed up.  Last week supplying banana display told me you get what you see when I asked if he had any green bananas. Today, I asked a stock man if he had the eggs for $1.49.  Told me he didn’t know and didn’t have time to look.
Multiple, probably 75 carts filled with items to be sorted across front of store, room for 1 person to exit emergency exit single file.  In an emergency no one would be exiting in that manner.  This is CLEARLY A VIOLATION and SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.
This store has serious problems.
My cashier was Bonnie.  She was very courteous and helpful. Helped me find a coupon so I could benefit from the lower price. She was the ONLY good thing I could say about today’s visit to this pathetic excuse for a store.; Very bad experience with a rude lady named Mariam (a lady around her 40s) and dressed with the least amount of effort. She literally rolled her eyes and complained to other customers for asking a question. I have always got a good experience, especially with a man named Ben. He was great. But the clerk named Mariam was just horrible and rude.; I decided to come on here and review today and noticed that I had an old review from over a year ago saying how great this place was. It was a five-star review. Well, that has all changed. What was the last straw for me was when I came to the door to go in a half an hour before closing time, and they would not let people in because they said they wanted everybody out by closing time. Well, in essence they made a new closing time, because if you can't go in for a box of cereal a half an hour before the store closes, well, in essence they made a new closing time. Not the time in the door.

What is the deal with the milk lately? They don't stock it like they used to.

I just think they're way overpriced, and I have found other places to shop that want my business more. I have been shopping at Walmart since and I've had no difficulty whatsoever. Walmart has a new loyal customer. I used to be a loyal Kroger customer. I do not recommend this particular store."

I called to make sure my script was ready for pick up, I was given confirmation it was ready.
I drove to pick it up and the woman working said it wasn't ready and they didn't have anything in process for me at all. She was frankly really rather rude. I asked if they could process it and if I could pick it up the next day. She said yes.
The next day comes around, I go to pick up my script and a different woman says it's not ready and they don't have anything in process for me. She was not nearly as rude, but it's still very frustrating to call and be told your script is ready, then have to go back multiple times just to get it.
I am officially switching to a new pharmacy; As someone who works in customer service daily. I have patience more than most. Today my son needed him prescription due to an ear infection. After leaving the urgent care office. I choice Kroger to fill his medicine. That will be my last attempt of EVER using Kroger! Amber at the drive thru has very unprofessional and rude. CVS went over and beyond to help us.; The personnel are always friendly and helpful to me. My big complaint like most people is wait time, specially inside. If a person‘s medicine is not ready to pull off the shelf and hand to them right then that person does not need to stand there taking up a window backing up other people whose medicines are ready, they need to take a seat and make way for other people to get on with their business. My last trip and I had a 30 minute wait time, and in that 30 minutes one lady took up one window for that whole time waiting on her medicine. That’s the part I find ridiculous that lady could’ve took a seat and several others could’ve been waited on while she waited for her medicine to be filled.; The past 3 times I've had to have prescription picked up, the wait time is horrible. It wouldn't be so bad if the drive thru was open, but despite being within the correct opening hours (and no where near lunchtime) it's been closed and I had to go in. Which includes holding a toddler for 30+ minutes every time.; I would give them less than one star.  They rarely open the drive thru and now they close for lunch regardless of how long you have been waiting in line.  They need to shut their pharmacy down altogether if they can’t provide any better customer service than that!!!"

The customer service here cannot be topped.; Title: Exceptional Service and Selection: A Five-Star Experience at Sipsters Liquor Store

I cannot recommend Sipsters Liquor Store highly enough! From the moment I walked in, I was impressed by the extensive selection of spirits, wines, and beers. However, what truly sets Sipsters apart is their unparalleled customer service. David assured that our clients for our private events would be taken care of and he went above and beyond.

David, the owner, goes above and beyond to ensure that every customer has a fantastic experience. He is incredibly knowledgeable about all of the products in the store and was more than happy to offer recommendations based on my preferences. His passion for what he does is evident, and it's clear that he genuinely cares about his customers.

Not only is David accommodating, but he also goes out of his way to make sure that each customer finds exactly what they're looking for. Whether it's a hard-to-find bottle of whiskey or a special gift for a loved one, David and his team are dedicated to making sure that every customer leaves satisfied.

The store itself is impeccably organized and well-stocked, making it easy to find exactly what you're looking for. Plus, the prices are incredibly reasonable, especially considering the level of service you receive.

Overall, my experience at Sipsters Liquor Store was nothing short of exceptional. I will definitely be referring more clients in the future and would recommend it to anyone in the area looking for a top-notch liquor store experience. Five stars all around!; How can you possibly go wrong... Sipstirs offer amazing customer service and have such an extensive knowledge & selection of fine wines, artisanal spirits and craft brews! A definite winner and my new go-to when I'm in Wilton (taking a cooking class at AMG Catering & Events... ) and in need of excellent wine advice and trustworthy suggestions. Be sure to speak with my new found friend & store manager - Alex DiZenzo. More to come... 😁; Great experience overall! Attentive and very knowledgeable staff, quality product and fair prices, there is a wine in stock for every type of wine drinker! This shop has a charm about it that really sets it apart from you're average wine/beer store. The store felt intimate and I felt very comfortable asking staff for help. Thank you Sipstirs!"

The prices seem a bit higher than other locations as well.; This store is always clean, well-lit and offers a great selection of all wines, beers and liquors; in addition to associated drinks and snacks. The lady who works at the register is always pleasant and easy to talk to. Recommended highly.; Has been there for many years and is a staple of the area. Good service and a good inventory. Still, the building has looked the same for ages. It would be nice to see some form of structural improvement to match with times. The surrounding area is busy during rush hour, but the traffic isn't that bad.

It would be nice to see the liquor store work with the plaza to widen the main road near the entry way closest to the store. I understand that might be placing more responsibility on the liquor store than may seem fair, but improvement is necessary for the community or grow and prosper. We can all do better."

I would recommend this to anyone; Best people working there if they don't have it they try to get it only place I go; Neighborhood package store, that treats customers with respect and Enjoy the commentary.; Every time I've been here there are no prices for the (already weak selection of) beer. I think this is a ploy to get people to buy no matter what the price is. I would rather go somewhere else where I know what the price is before I walk up to the counter. There's really nothing else special about this store that would bring me in there."

Kind of like an old general store kinda feel. I stop in there mostly to cash checks, and it's generally quite fast service. I don't remember the exact percentage they keep for cashing the check? But it's definitely reasonable. Only thing id say is that their policy is they can't cash a check that's 7 days past it's original date.

I have found it difficult to find stores that serve quality beverages the way this store does. My favorite part of this store is that they have a ginormous wine collection. They also have a section for non-alcoholic beverages. That is extremely appealing to someone like me. I highly recommend this place and I will definitely return soon. I want to remind everyone to please drink responsibly and in moderation. As grown adults, we should be setting the example for people around us, especially the next generation.; I come to this package store often only due to it's proximity to where I live,  and because they generally have a wide variety of liquor and beer here. The staff is usually pretty helpful/friendly. The only thing I wish they would do is add more of their sour and milkshake style craft beers to the refrigerated section cuz it sucks to purchase warm beer that I have to then wait for to get cold once I get home lol; There's a good wine selection and good prices too. However, the staff recommendations could be much better. They have a bias for Italian wines, which are good but let's face it, there are other countries that make wine as good (or even better, in my opinion) than Italy. The last time that I've been here I make it clear that I didn't want an Italian wine and that I don't like acid wines. The staff recommended me a Barolo and insisted me on buying it....I bought it, not very sure about it, and it was sooo acid. And I was so disappointed, as I felt that the staff recommended me something NOT based on my taste but based on something else.; Great selection of alcohol. The only problem is there is no bar supply's really. It's very limited. I was looking for a decent drink shaker. They have 1... and it's really small; Good selection my only issue is they have a ton of good beers that they don't keep cold. They have a "" rapid chiller""  but tbh it's just a bucket of water doesn't do much to chill wine or beers ... But other than that they do a good job."

Not a big store but has a good variety.; I go here to cash in all bottles and cans the Store is having some kind of issue with their distributors and they were not allowing anyone to get cash for their redemptions of cans and bottles but because I go in there a lot they allowed me to get cash. FYI whoever gets their bottles and cans pay this store what they need to be able to pay people what they need because someone coming in there might need the money for food or other personal items and can't use it as store credit. All I'm saying. Great Place; Family owned and the wife and her daughter are great  on suggesting and pairing up wines for your occasion. Place can use a coat of paint and updating to make it look fresh. The prices are reasonable and have a pretty big selection to choose from.; Beware. Expired craft brew everywhere.

What an awful experience. They had a wonderful selection of craft brew unfortunately most of it was expired some even over a year old.

The guy at the counter told me that one variety had just come in and I've had believed him. Unfortunately it wasn't fresh at all and tasted like a combination of feces, Malta goya, and champagne not the New England IPA flavor I was looking for for $16 a four-pack.

On closer inspection The Brew was out-of-date by at least a month meaning that it was around 8 or 9 months old.

Made me pretty sick too I'll never go there again.

While looking through the beer dates the guy in the circle counter kept giving me a hard time. Even to the point of trying to tell me that beer doesn't go bad because it's in a can. I said thank you and kept looking but he kept harassing me.

I picked up the four pack that I bought and he yelled ""That just came in! If that's too old for you we're going to have a problem!"" which is why I ended up just taking it an leaving and then finding out it was out of date afterwards."

I've lived in Wethersfield my entire life and have shopped here regularly. It was convenient and clean. Last night I went there to purchase wine, beer, and liquor for holiday giving. The usual guy takes my debit card and gives me a receipt for $125 and change. Note: this place **never** offers or gives a receipt unless the customer requests one. I think to myself, that's pretty high for two six packs of beer, two bottles of wine, and a bottle of liquor. BUT, I think, I'll check the receipt when I get home. When I got home and inspected the receipt I noted that it is NOT itemized, it just says $125 paid. So I go online and see the Connecticut prices of what I bought. I WAS FURIOUS -- I called the store and asked them to tell me what they charge for the few items I bought. The guy on the phone says that they MISTAKENLY charged me twice for everything. So I get back in the car, drive back to the store, they issued a refund and took back their goods.
BOTTOM LINE -- these places that don't give receipts are suspect. I AM NEVER GOING BACK to a place that rips you off, then inconveniences you to make it right. You'll notice in the photos that none of the products are listed.; Good for grab & go! Decent variety.; I only buy alcohol as gifts for other people, so I cant comment on whether their price are reasonable, but the customer service was on point, very friendly and even wrapped the bottle of wine in decorative foil and ribbon for me at no additional cost. It did seem a bit cluttered, like the amount of merchandise would benefit from  a bigger space and everything didn't have prices obviously labeled.; Good prices, the children are very polite; Prices here were astronomically high compared to other liquor stores. Don't recommend at all"

He's ordered things just because I wanted to try them on more than 1 occasion. 10/10, absolutely reccomend!; I purchased 4 bottles of alcohol from this business. Two bottles of Soju, one bottle of passionfruit liquor and a tiny bottle of Bailey's. Initially I had grabbed a bottle of passionfruit parrot bay. I changed my mind and set it down somewhere else. I'll admit i should have put it back.

Upon reaching the counter and checking out I was embarrassed by a cashier named Sam who reluctantly gave me his name. He made me walk around with him until I found the bottle. I said I never stole anything in my life. He said just trying to put it back. He did this loudly in front of other customers.

I'm never buying from them again He was super rude and I urge you to go spend your money elsewhere.

I tried to call the manager today ( I don't do these things ) and the same cashier said he could help me. He also refused to give me the managers name or even tell me when they would be in. He said he doesn't know anything about the person he works for

Avoid this place!; Arab run- which means you can expect dirty store and rude workers who hoard money but put nothing into the community or into the store. Confident enough to wear gold to work but complains when you touch any products. We’re not in Hartford chill I came with money. He treats customers with such disrespect no wonder the store is empty and out of stock.; Best liquor store around! The owner is kind and always there to help with a suggestion whether it be beer or wine. There is a great selection and I always find new favorites when I'm there. There are certain bottles I can find here, that other stores in the area don't carry.; MK's is a great store with an awesome selection of beer and bourbon, very impressive. The staff is friendly, and more importantly knowledgeable. They made recommendations to me that I thoroughly enjoyed - this is my new favorite package store."

For a small store, this place has a lot to offer.  At first glance, it seems there were only a few items (I turned right and found some booze and a few other items) then passed a frozen goods cabinet and thought that was the extent of the store. But, I turned left and found an entire other side of the store. It’s a bit cramped, but there are a couple of “aisles” to travel.

Great beer selection including local PR offerings.

We were just browsing after the storm (a bit hungry but not knowing what we wanted) and an employee even came and asked if she could help me find anything.

It is also the best stocked dairy, ice cream, gelato and other frozen treats, drinks of all persuasions, chips and snacks, frozen meat/veggies, AND as it turns out, they had guava paste, which was not available at the largest store in town.

Not as big as the Speedway location, but at least your not under constant hassle by the AP staff like Speedway.; This is a nice Walmart the employees are always nice, and helpful. They don't carry a variety because they are so small, but what they carry they usually have in stock. My only complaint has to do with online groceries department, sometimes they say they don't have an item in stock when i know they do because i saw it with my own eyes. For example a 40 lbs bag of dog food. I will shop there, and see it, but because I don't have a vehicle, I will do a delivery, and they will say it's not in stock, the same day I have seen it on the shelf. They have done this more than once to me, with bottles of water and once Tylenol for children. The other issue I have is with the online shoppers, they tend to not be so ""choosey"" with produce, etc. I have gotten plenty of moldy produce, cut open bags of frozen items, dented cans, and broken packages, lids and containers for cleaning solutions. This may be the carelessness of the driver's, but I just know what has happened to me. Their return policy is great, very easy, and I have never had a problem. This store is still worth the out of the way travel, in my opinion.; Convenient store to get in and out of because it's at a traffic light.  There is always plenty of parking.  The interior of the store and the park8ng lot are clean and well maintained.   Shelves are well stocked, and meat selection is good.  Staff are helpful even if they're busy, busy.

Mikhail Bakhtin's book Rabelais and His World explores Gargantua and Pantagruel and is considered a classic of Renaissance studies.[15] Bakhtin declares that for centuries Rabelais' book had been misunderstood. Throughout Rabelais and His World, Bakhtin attempts two things. First, to recover sections of Gargantua and Pantagruel that in the past were either ignored or suppressed. Secondly, to conduct an analysis of the Renaissance social system in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language which was not.[16]

Through this analysis, Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts in Rabelais' work: the first is carnivalesque which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and the second is grotesque realism, which is defined as a literary mode. Thus, in Rabelais and His World, Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.[16]; Excellent And fast service; Not much help; ; "

If you click on the link that said “see full RX status” it takes you to an “error” screen.  If you call the phone number you NEVER can speak to a human.  If you leave a message it goes to nowhere and you do not get a response.  Five days later,  I received the same text with the same malfunctioning links and useless phone number.  After 10 days, I still do not have my meds and when I physically went there the employee told me they have no record of my calls and that the phone number does not ever go to a live person.  He acted as if I called a wrong number and gave me a hand written number which was exactly the same number I had left my previous messages on.  In addition, my prescriptions still hadn’t n’t been filled.  The whole is system is a nightmare and I will avoid using CVS pharmacy ever again.; Love the people who work at this store. Someone always greets me when I enter. Pharmacy staff is always helpful and never rushes me.; Excellent experience...they went over and above to get me my meds a d without them probably wouldn't have gotten my much needed meds. This is the only pharmacy I'm going to anymore. Great Pharmacy staff all around; This pharmacy continues to disappoint. Not sure why I have to remind them to fill my scripts, or which doctor to call and telling me they will have a script filled later in the day that doesn't happen. This time they told me they were out after telling me in the morning it will be filled. I have never had so much difficulty with a pharmacy.  Though they have plenty of excuses."

This was my second visit to this CVS and he went above and beyond both visits. The store has a good selection of beauty items and toiletries, as well as, great sales. Easily accessible too.; During this visit it was great timing because I was first in line and they waited on me within 5 minutes and had my prescriptions ready they were also very considerate; I do not understand why all five employees must take the same 30 minute lunch break. Even if they did not have a.” Pharmacist” For that 30 minutes, they could at least have a tech or person to allow you to pick up refills.; Worst pharmacy I've ever used. They will screw things up. And they won't care. I feel confident in my opinion here after checking with my insurance, Dr., and another pharmacist.

Mike Sanchez appears to be the issue here. Everyone else, on the other hand, seems quite competent tho, very kind, and didn't play dumb like he. Thank you guys.; As a customer who has been with cvs for years while avidly using my care pass every chance I get, I have never been met with such disrespect and ignorance from a pharmacist named Jessie ray. The first interaction I had with her was on the phone trying to correct a prescription mistake that she messed up. I was given 30 of my 60 pills before the new year and waited til today to fix it. While on the phone with her, she tells me that I have never been to this pharmacy, it may have been a mistake so I give her all of my information and she tells me that the insurance that I gave her isn’t even accepted here? (I just picked up my prescription 6 days prior) so I decide to drive in and bring my prescriptions to the pharmacy where she is hostile from the beginning as I came 20 minutes prior to her lunch starting. I again physically give her my information and she is falsely giving me information that is not on my file. She tells me that I have this insurance I’ve never heard of, than when I ask where it came from she said that they bypassed it to my real insurance which she told me DIDNT exist. So as I’m trying to figure out why I can’t get my prescription she starts telling me to calm down and that I am no longer allowed to get my prescriptions from this location for being rude. I have had nothing but the up most respect for every employee in that facility as I am there 5-10 times a month. Her actions were not only unprofessional, they were unethical, highly inappropriate and misleading. I am not angery at this facility, I am angry and hurt that a licensed pharmacist who has an obligation to do their duty failed so deeply that I felt the need to write this review"

A gentleman I spoke to by the name of Larry was the first person I had talked to after calling countless liquor and wine stores locally and not so locally who knew what I was talking about where to get it and even knew or looked up the ratings and gave alternative suggestions with higher quality and lower prices.

Prices are fair but by no means the lowest in town.

That said, the owner was friendly and took the initiative to give advice on selecting the right wine. The beautiful caged parakeets are a pleasant and unique addition to the store's ambience. The bottle of kosher Chilean Merlot that I purchased turned out to be excellent and was greatly enjoyed by myself and others.

I take issue, however, with the price charged. The owner asserts that there is a sign posted prominently informing customers of a surcharge for credit card purchases under a certain dollar amount. I used a debit card, though, so no fee should have been charged. Indeed, I have never been charged extra for making a purchase with a debit card. I was immediately suspicious that the price was incorrect and specifically asked if that simply reflected the discounted sale price plus sales tax, which the owner assured me it did. I then requested a printed receipt, which I was told was not possible. When I received the receipt by text, I was disappointed to see that it was not itemized, so there was of course no mention of any credit card surcharge. It showed only the jacked-up total without explanation.

Such a practice understandably leaves a customer feeling taken advantage of. This merchant would do well to improve his transactional transparency if he hopes to maintain customer satisfaction and ensure repeat business.; Small but nice; Limited selection of the most generic items. They store the wine upright.; great wine selection and hard liquor.; "

Everything is always fully stocked so you're never disappointed they ran out of something. They have a lot of fridge space so you have tons of options for already chilled drinks.; A little overpriced and sometimes the beer is well past the expiration date. My biggest gripe is the store owner is constantly on the phone talking loudly during transactions and never offers any sort of greeting or familiar acknowledgment particularly with how often I’m in here. Purely transactional and unfriendly 100% of the time.; Been going here about a year.  The selection is great, and the staff are always chill and check you out fast.  I feel at ease in the store; I am well versed in wine, beer and some spirits. The prices are stable and fair, it is clean and well-stocked, and yet I have serious issue with this place. I have ABSOLUTELY nothing against devout Muslims, nor against teetotalers, but I am growing weary of people who absolutely do not and will not consume alcohol attempting to sell me alcohol. Their advice is shallow and inaccurate, and their expertise almost nonexistent. People from a culture that swears off of alcohol should not be selling it. Furthermore, I have had several experiences where I have felt judged as an alcohol user. I never appear drunk or unruly, I go in there and quietly select what I want and pay and get out. I have plenty of money in my accounts, by the way. Take tonight, for instance. There was a man sitting there who I had never seen. He sat in the ""manager's chair"" and did not ring me up. He stared at me with judgment and contempt in his eyes. I am a very perceptive person and could see it plain as day. I looked away, then a few seconds later looked back and he is still staring at me with a clearly negative and judgmental stare. I returned the look and then looked away. I wanted to say something but I am a mature person and bit my tongue. However, I will never forget the attitude and vitriol I saw in his eyes. If there was a closer liquor store to my house I would use it. I can hardly stand shopping there. Like I said, I don't care about their religion, at all, but I can hardly stomach buying alcohol from a staff that in its entirety will not drink it.; Really nice new store. They have a decent variety.. A little more expensive than Target or Binny's, but not as expensive as another boutique liquor store down the street by the Uptown theater. I'm happy to pay a few extra dollars and support local. A bunch of new businesses have popped up near hear recently. Uptown is getting some much needed realization."

I appreciate the convenience near the train and other businesses.
The store is small but manages to have a decently broad selection of wines at various price points, achieved in part by tall shelves and narrow aisles. The wines are mostly arranged by variety. I do not drink beer but there seemed to be a strong selection of beer as well.
On the downside, prices are higher, the wine I bought was $15.99 but a google search showed other places sold it from as low as $9.99 to $16; with the vast majority being about $12.99 - so expect to pay a bit more for that bottle of wine grabbed for dinner.
The other downside, I spent over 20 minutes getting a feel for how the wine was arranged and options and no one once asked me if I needed help, offered a greeting as I entered or noticed me.  Nor was there much guidance - aside from producer generated ""guides"" here and there, a few bottles said ""staff picks"" with no guidance - why? is it fruity? crisp? So you will either need to know your wines before you go in or be willing to buy ""blind"".
For a small local store, more interaction would be nice (visited on a Friday around 5:30 pm); Great place. They worked with me to get a keg, even though they don’t sell them usually, for a party. Great selection too. Can’t beat it.; This is a very nice liquor store in a convenient location with a pretty nice selection of craft beers. I was able to find some one off speciality beers not easily found in most liquor stores. However, the management knows this and prices accordingly. Prices are approximately 20-30% higher than any other liquor store I have come across in the area.; The selection is great and the staff is outstanding.  They are the only place I know that can get me hard to find bottles of whiskey and bourbon. Outstanding neighborhood small business; I haven't actually been here, but I'm sure it's awesome.
Thing was, we came out to Vito's last week, mid day. Sadly, the place was closed. Not only that, there was a wooden sawhorse in front with police tape all over it. On closer look, many of the stores had for lease signs! Further, there were no parked cars! Was the whole block being demolished? Panic washed over us. Where would we get our Romano? Our Parm? It took all my strength not to jump the curb and drive thru a plate glass window. Fewf."

Always check to make sure product is secured and unopened as some boxes were leaking. A little overpriced on some items compared to other places in the area but it’s a well stocked store with great staff operating.; People who work here are rude! I Told them about a vape that wasn’t working they became defensive and accused us of being on government assistance because I asked for a new cartridge. Never in my years have I seen service so terrible!; Limited choices on wine. No pricing marked.; It’s a great environment!; Conveniently location with everything you could need all day and night.

- The girl with a $1, 200 order; Very nice store, great deals and lots of verities, if you become a member they will give you points and discount highly recommended.; Great selection of drinks unfortunately I would take your business elsewhere. Staff is very unfriendly. After a purchase we asked if we could use a box (grabbing one from a large pile) and one woman came over and grabbed it out of our hands and said you have to buy the box. We were confused but decided to let it be and leave and they said “yeah keep on walking” ?? It was such an odd interaction when we literally just asked for a box. Needless to say we will not be returning and if you do go steer clear of the boxes.; I could wander around Binny’s for hours looking at the pretty bottles.

I did pick up a Weller Special reserve here for 100$ and found it at 2 different stores later that week for only 38$, I should’ve known better. That being said I don’t think I’ve ever seen a regular Blantons listed for as high as 300$. That’s insane. It’s for sale just down the street at 199$ right now and on occasion you can find it downtown between 90$ and 165$. Whoever pays over 300% MSRP on a bottle of base Blantons is a sucker.; Best. Place. Ever. For N/A Beer Drinkers!

Incredible selection of N/A beers.
Mario, the Beer Manager spent the time and effort to build out a diverse line-up of NA beer favorites with over 17 to choose from.

Today I went in and basically accused them of a mistake from the day before. They graciously explained how it wasn't really possible and I quickly saw that my claim was silly. At no point did they make me feel bad or anything. I have no doubt that any of the guys working here would have provided the same kind service.

Love how there's always multiple new and interesting things in the coolers (tbh I'm not a wine/spirits person). When I've asked questions on my picks, they always have answers. Surprising, given the selection they have.

Highly recommend this little neighborhood alcohol store.; No need to travel to a big box liquor store. This neighborhood gem is a full service liquor store. Huge wine selection, with great knowledgeable staff. Beer and spirit selection is big and diverse.
If these guys don't have it, they'll order it for you. Also they always have some great sales on wines.; I wouldn't go back again. I've been a civil rights and labor investigator for several years and I know the signs of surveillance. To a degree I get approaching folks to help them shop for wines, it's a dialogue, but being walked to the register and having someone hover over you? Come on now. It made me feel rushed and obligated to make a purchase to prove I wasn't a thief. 2 stars for trying the decent conversation though.; These guys are great! Skip your big box retailers and stop in to support this family-run business. They have a great selection of craft beers, well-curated selection of spirits, and wide-variety of wines (but not overwhelming). The brothers are very helpful with sharing their knowledge and offering up recommendations (and they are not necessarily the high-priced items). They also have a great selection of bitters!

Lawrence recently offered a great Pet-Nat; I'll be going back to pick-up another bottle. Thank you guys!; Nice selection of whiskey at good prices. Most impressive part was a bottle of Wild Turkey Rare Breed bottled in 2016 for a confusingly low price. They might have a reserve of special bottles they put out randomly. Quite the fun find as a whiskey hunter."

This store has, or can get, most items you look for from a Kroger supermarket. The staff will also help you save money by pointing out items that may be on sale! The location is a great convenience and easy to get in and out of. I greatly recommend the Big K ( Kroger brand soft drinks). They are way better than most off brand soda!
I also recommend the Kroger brand foods are excellent and inexpensive.
The bakery is filled with a variety of treats and breads that are high quality and delicious.
The seafood section is second to none in the local area. They have a variety of fresh seafood, including salmon!
The meat section has a wide variety and a very helpful staff.
I highly recommend this location. It has everything a Kroger should have and the staff is very helpful. Needless to say, it is busy during the late afternoon!; Everybody knows that this Kroger, at least in this area is the bougie Kroger.

The espresso martini was an excellent bonus. Can't wait to try some of their coffee beans when I get back to Cali. Much love!; Small and cozy. Rum infused cigar was delicious.

When I called to ask what I could do about this, they told me I needed to come back to the store, which was 45 min from me - I work in this town part time on a semi annual basis but don't work or live there regularly.  I told them I would not be coming back, as that would take time and gas money, and they proceeded to tell me that my driving must have been the cause of the milk spilling, then asked why I would place an order 45 min from my home.  That is none of your business, Crystal.  You could refund my entire order for the damage to my car, you could ask to see photos, you could do so many other things - but you did not.  Then this woman suggested I leave the milk in my car for a week and when I am back in that town, show her the damage.  You seriously think I can leave milk in my car for a week in June in Arizona, are you an idiot?  It would smell. I have been buying groceries from you for three years. Never again - you are horrible.; Always feel this store is just mediocre.  Nothing special.  Employees are friendly, but the store seems dismal due to dark flooring perhaps?  Only ever go here when it's convenient or a great bargain is to be had.; This place just hasn’t been the same since my favorite florist Amanda left (not me totally different unrelated other person also named Amanda). I cry every time I walk in and don’t see her here anymore. It’s a great store and there’s many lovely people here, but Amanda’s gone and it’s just not the same.; Very nice store, friendly staff store wasn't crowded at all found everything we needed okay prices; Nice and clean store.

The variety of fruits and vegetables available was exceptional, and everything was incredibly fresh. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly, always ready to offer helpful advice and recommendations. The overall experience was fantastic, and I highly recommend D Gardens for anyone looking for top-quality produce and cheeses on the island.

Recommend the mango frappe for a hot sunny day.; The place and ambience:
This place is well kept and very beautiful. It has a garden, a small market where you can buy fresh produce (plants, eggs, fish etc.) and a smoothie stand. It's hard to describe the ambience but the pictures I have shared will give you a good idea. It's hot in PR but there's plenty of shade here for you to enjoy a smoothie, frappe, jugo or acai bowls if you fancy any of that.

Price and value:
The smoothie stand is on the edge of being pricey (about 9$ for a smoothie, 7$ for a frappe) but I would say it is worth the money. The produce market seemed to have average farmer's market prices. The value here is from ""freshness"" and the ambience.; Great produce. I filled my fridge twice from here during my trip. Thursday is the day they get there fresh items in. Biggest, sweetest pineapple I've ever eaten came from here. Next time I'm back, I'll definitely be stopping by. Check them out. Oh, fresh smoothies and bowls too.; Delicious! I got the coconut based fruit bowl for breakfast and it was amazing. I grabbed a couple bites for the beach in the shop and I was set until dinner :-); Amazing fresh produce at reasonable prices. Loved the quality of the fruits /veggies available here. Had a mini brunch here with their wide choice of smoothies and fruit bowls. The folks at the desk were also very friendly. Must visit if you're in Culebra."

I have very particular items that I look for, they don't always have it, but they always help me find them.  Even so far as to save some in the back for me.   The service is so far above and beyond, that I continue to go to them even though it's now completely out of my way due to my recent residency change.   You just can't pass up that kind of service.; Broad selection. Lake liquor offers many options for whiskey and craft beers. Friendly workers will help you locate anything on the shelf you might need.

Lady was nice but on the outside looks like the owner doesnt care about the property.; I been coming to Romulus Liquor since 2000 when my father and I moved to the neighborhood.
It’s always been the same family running the store, Sam and Lee.
They have always been extremely friendly, always treated me like family.
If they didn’t sell a certain product and you wanted it they would order it for me just so I didn’t have to drive to another store to purchase it.

My 6 year old daughter lives coming here because they always talk directly to her and make her feel comfortable when she wants to buy chips or candy lol

I most definitely recommend stopping here if your in the area.; Very unwelcoming and ripoffs who take advantage of the public. This is THE worst place to go. They take advantage of the fact that they're the closest corner store and have everything double to triple the prices of what it should be. Not to mention, most of their food is expired so WATCH BEFORE YOU BUY. Oh, and if you're a person of color other than whatever this store owner is, you best believe they follow you up and down these aisles like you're a petty thief or criminal. What's criminal is what these people do. I'm surprised the city hasn't come in and shut this rat hole down.; Prices are getting lower now. The customer service is better. this store has been here 30 years and I have never had a problem with this store the owners are very cool. People make problems with them for no reason they are really cool people to know. My family has been shopping here for years I love this store!!!!; Tons of expired food. Buy old bread and charge full price. Take advantage of the people who live close and can't go to better stores. Usually don't charge state minimum liquor prices, though they advertise that they do.

I was looking for cider and found their selection pretty small, but they did have Black Apple's Strawberry Cider, which I've been wanting to try. My husband scoped out the beers. The one major frustration was that there were almost no single cans or bottles, most everything is in a pack, which meant we couldn't buy much because we were on a brief visit to the area.

We “as customers” were told to “shut up” after he admitted to discrimination. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS NO GOOD !! Terrible RACIST PLACE !; We recommend this place.
Over the last 3 years we have been going to this liquor store. The reasons we keep going back...
1. They ALWAYS have been friendly, from the moment you walk through the door.
2. If you need some help they are more than happy to provide assistance. Most time they ask us if we need any help.
3. When you get to the register they ask if you found everything your were looking for.
4. While at the register I never feel rushed and have a little chat with them.
5. While paying for your items they ask if you need help taking your purchase out to the car.
6. Prices and selection are more than adequate.
Going there is always an extremely pleasant experience.; Upon arrival I was watched like a hawk as if I were attempting to steal , But I continued to shop not paying any mind to it until I heard one of the coworkers say to the other to watch me because people “like me “ steal . I was upset and offended by what I had just heard so I decided to put the bottle I was going to purchase back as I was followed putting the bottle back I politely asked do all of your customers get this treatment and the man which I assume was the manager replied “why does it matter this is my buisness “ I didn’t understand why he was being so rude to me I told him you shouldn’t treat well paying customers this way then he called me a racial slur and told me to shut up ! I then left and told him I would post a bad review and he told me nobody would care . I advise ANYONE who is a good person and stands for equality to not support this buisness any longer !; Horrible staff extremely racist towards black people specifically. I went in there and didn’t even purchase anything because the whole time I was being watched on the big  screen. Very unethical behavior towards their customers. DO NOT SHOP AT THIS STORE unless you like being watched.; This place has a nice sized selection. One of the most obvious places where they choose what to sell at MSRP and what to sell at exorbitant prices, some above secondary market. They are helpful though and will point you in the right direction."

She had such a nasty ass attitude, didn’t pay attention was always on her phone, this is a place of business, not your free time. I’ve always came to the store and never had issues, do better.; Highly recommend!! Food was phenomenal, wine was good and Krystal provided amazing service! It was my first time, but definitely won't be my last!!; Would rate it at 5 but damn are the employees in the morning rude and unwelcoming. Night employees are always a joy to be around.; Great neighbourhood liquor store with everything you need. Even some organic wine and friendly and knowledgeable staff. They now even have an organic wine section with a good selection from all over the world.; The guys at Sullivant’s are always super friendly and helpful. They make great recommendations when I don’t see what I’m looking for or decide to try something new. You can tell they really enjoy being there and are knowledgeable about what they sell. They’ve got a great beer selection, with plenty to choose from by way of craft, local and domestics. Not massive like Colonial but not tiny either.
The vibe of the place is really cool and the drive thru is great for when I don’t feel like getting out of the car. It’s a little out of my way, but I regularly make the drive when I’m looking for a seasonal or something specific because I know they’ll have it nine times out of 10.
Sullivant’s is one of my favorite liquor stores in the Little Rock area."

What is priced is typically incorrectly outside the cooler. You could pick up a 6 pack that’s priced anywhere between $9 - $25! This has been standard practice since management changed hands a few years ago.; The people are pleasant, but the cigarettes I bought from them were several months out of date. The inside packaging was changed several months ago, but their's still have the old packaging and taste extremely stale. For nearly $16 a pack they should be fresh. The rum was standard, but I smoke when I drink, so it was pointless.; Best store ever they have almost anything you want for good price and need staff is super nice and sometimes they have tastings too.; Prices are fair and the store is clean.

Target is a wonderful store with  superior Customer service, I can't complain. There's been incidences, but for the most part-at least 90% of the time -They're quick, convenient and always ready to help. I really enjoy their drive up pickup service where they bring your items to your car. What a Time Saver-so convenient and helpful! Thank you to Target For being a good retailer with great deals, a good selection of products and awesome customer loyalty rewards/coupons and for giving back to the community!; The store is clean and well lit but expect an extremely long wait at the register. The self-checkout lanes were closed, and they had ONE cashier. When I walked up to the register, a woman was filling the conveyor belt with party favors and knick-knacks and had separated everything into two orders. The cashier was making small talk while she scanned each item, then scanned them again with a second device then discussed the price for EACH item. Four more people walked up behind me, so six people are now in line while the cashier takes her time and continues chatting. Finally, a second register opens, but the cashier fails to say, ""I can help the NEXT person in line.""  Consequently, all four people behind me rush to the next register, and the man who got there first was out the door, while the cashier in my line was still scanning the items for the woman in front of me.  The long wait and poor customer service was not worth the ONE item I stood in line for.  The staff could definitely use training in customer service.; Checking out was fast and easy how it should be. Ronny was friendly and quick at the checkout section. Things seem in order; Bad service i purchased item I see on the app I go to the target on 43 Ave and Peoria the store have not same price as the app show even though it’s pick up do I have to go back waste my time and gas and the manager there is worthless and tell you should tell us the price why do you have different price then target app very disappointing; Great costumer service , very shining store parking lot out Is medium,  business area , prices are OK and depends on quality of product"

I had a prescription for 90-days of medication.  They made a mistake and only gave me 30 days.  They fixed it, but in doing so, messed up their computer records.  When the next 90-day refill came along, they only gave me 60 days.  One of their associates promised to fix it.  When I called back in for an update, I got someone else who told me it was my fault for signing.  A second person told me it was between me and my insurance.  I'm taking my business elsewhere.

UPDATE:  I contacted the executive office of CVS.  I received a prompt reply.  They escalated my concerns to the field leadership team overseeing this store location.  Someone from that local team drove to the pharmacy and had them package up the missing pills for me.  I was very happy with the corporate response.  However, when I picked up the order, the pharmacy staff member simply said, ""Here you go.""  No apology whatsoever.; Update: this CVS location has come a long way in the past few years. They seemed to finally be fully staffed. Which is great because it’s still always busy in the pharmacy. Several of the employees have been super friendly and helpful. They make an otherwise daunting task quite doable now thankfully.

Always busy. Takes forever to get a scrip filled. If it’s called in, it won’t be ready until the following afternoon. Very difficult to get  someone to answer the phone without being on hold for at least 10-20 minutes minimum.; The wall says open 9am-8pm today, but they are currently on ""lunch"".  Everyone is still working but the gate is shut lol. You can see and hear everybody working while on ""lunch"" but keep out ppl picking up medicine.

If you're gonna be on lunch, fine... please update hours on the wall then.  But if you're gonna keep working, let us pick up our prescriptions.; Not buying their previous reviews as authentic. I have a controlled substance that needs to be filled. I get an automated call saying it’s filled and ready for pick up, then 12 hours later I get a text saying it’s out of stock—so you gave my Rx to someone else? Next day they not only refused to acknowledge what happened, they refuse to tell me nor the doctor what’s available so the right dosage & quantity can be filled… despite several calls of me putting up with their conflicting info & massive waste of my time (days going by) i always politely end the call with “OK well thank you for your help”, John says as little as possible during the call and makes it a game of 50 questions to try and figure out how to get your Rx filled, then when you express polite appreciation (despite his anti-social service) he simply hangs up on you 🤮🤮🤮—straight up mommy issues. I have multiple chronic diseases and was thinking about moving all 16 of my prescriptions here. Not now! John is a nightmare for women. Don’t be surprised when glowing reviews from women “randomly” show up after this—they’re likely paid for…; These guys were very professional and friendly. They were able to take me in early for my rescheduled appointment after another nearby CVS cancelled my Covid test.

Crystal is so patient and kind. She made the experience great. Thank you!"

I feel like the only downside is that the cashiers get a bit caught up in conversation with some of their customers so the time spent increases. but then again, they're just talkative and that isn't detrimental. overall, great place for snacks.; Prices are almost triple on some bottles, by far the most expensive I have seen in arizona.

I've got a pretty decent selection but the place that used to be here was far superior.
This place has a giant basement that they're not even using for retail customers anymore.
It's an absolute shame since they can have a speakeasy or a dozen other other things down there.; Remember when stores used to have walk-in humidors? This one still has one! Don't expect prices like Walmart or Costco for your beer and liquor.. this isn't a cheap store, it's a convenient store. You may pay a dollar or two more than the others, but you'll also find things like moonshine with fruit still in it, odd flavors for whiskey and rum that aren't available conveniently elsewhere. I didn't need to use the restroom, so I don't know if there is one for the customers... There is access for wheelchairs, and the aisles are wide enough to get through. It seems like a small store when you go inside, but the selection is pretty good for what it is. There is also a drive through for your easy purchases! There is also a small section for bartending tools like jiggers, shakers, muddlers, and spoons. Also many straw options like glass, metal, and silicone. Take a look, at least.. and see for yourself.; Bad Habits is a Liquor Store on 2nd Place of North Country Club Drive in Mesa AZ. It used to be named Sun Devil Liquor. The name change happened recently and I recently visited the new ownership for a bottle of wine, Pinot Noir, to go with my spaghetti dinner.

The staff was pleasant, helpful and provided me with this selection in the video to choose from. I used to buy kegs from the prior ownership and the quality, cleanliness, and location is just as great as always.; Sun Devil Liquors.

It's an awesome local, full service, complete shop with tastings and events. Unassuming and welcoming. Staff makes sure you find what you need.; This place was awesome as Sun Devil Liquors. However, as ""Bad Habits,"" they have made some regrettable changes.

1. Beer can no longer be bought by the bottle or mixed into custom 6 packs. Their selection is smaller with less variety.

2. If you make the mistake of bringing a single beer to the checkout, be prepared to be spoken to like a child when the cashier explains the policy change.

3. The pros are there is still a liquor store here. And the selection, though not as varied, is still better than most."

Clearly they gave me the least popular because I hadn't tried them before (and the little wasn't great.) And clearly the salesperson either didn't care to count or gave me the least popular on purpose! What a disappointment, I was taking these out of state to visit family! Never coming here again! I actually made it clear I was taking these out of state and wanted a mixture. 15 limes out of 20. When I asked for an even mixture of three flavors! Ridiculous! Selfish!

I am so grateful that BBB exists!  So very helpful :); I filed a complaint with the BBB at Pacific Southwest in Arizona against EOS Fitness Gym for  a refund that I was owed.  The gym ignored my request that I was entitled.   The BBB obviously connected with the proper people from the headquarters of the gym and I received my refund.   I was amazed that I received the refund.  The personnel I spoke with at the BBB were friendly, polite and obviously trained well. I am extremely pleased with the service I received.   A professional organization due to the people they hire.; Wow! Great thanks again for your help with getting the refund. The Better  Business Bureau Serving the Pacific Southwest is the place to get help with problems associated with purchases made online. After getting the runaround from the company for several months, I  contacted  the BBB with my problem. I followed their prompts and gave them the information that was requested. In a matter of days I had my refund. Thanks again for the excellent customer service and honesty."

Seriously the ones that keep giving 5 are you serious? I wouldn’t pay half the amount for that food. I know food trucks and stands with more flavor. Only wine menu by the bottle. No menu for wine by the glass and no cocktail menu. No ambiance. I rather spend my crypto elsewhere. Sorry, chef suggestion less paprika and just a little S&P.  The ones that say beat restaurant in PR doesn’t even make too 50 for me.; A very special and refined dining destination. The owner/chef partners are very conscientious and careful to ensure a refined and customer-focused experience, and as a result I have been told that this restaurant is a frequent and favorite spot for many of the local businessmen and women of the San Juan area. The menu selections for our party of four, although a bit on the pricey side, were outstanding in preparation , presentation, freshness, and seasoning. I had the Bronzino, a special for today, which was expertly cooked moist on the inside, and with a seared crunchy skin. My wife had the octopus which was soft but not mushy. Our tuna appetizer was super-fresh and all dishes were nicely sized but not at all overwhelming. The wine list is extensive, and our waiter recommended an excellent Spanish wine that was a very nice blend that mated well with our entrees. Evidently their wine importing was the original core of their business and they expanded to add a Spanish dining experience over the years. If you want to experience a low-key, refined and  high quality restaurant focused on good food and good wine for the local area (with no attempt to cater to the tourists only), then this is your place.; Absolutely mesmerizing and gorgeous food,  service and overall experience.; This place have a very special place in my heart cause it use to be one of my mother favorites.   She was a spaniard and she always mentioned the how faithful to the spanish heritage was the selection they presented.   Maximino had imprinted a personal and intimate touch in every corner of this beautiful place.
It's diffucult to separate the superb stadard of the cuisine from the friendly elegance of their staff.    Its like a family with high end manners and empathy wich nowadays give them a very exotic added value on this industry.
Wine selection beyond description begining with my favorites from Vinedos y Bodegas Ponce!!
Maximino and everyone at Compostela thanks so much for being there!!!
See you soon!!!
JSanchez; best Spanish restaurant in Puerto Rico, they have been in business for 40 years and they still manage to be revelant and up to date, service is efficient and amicable at the same time, wine list is very interesting and at reasonable prices, it is a fine dining experience with a casual atmosphere"

I live in the Cupey/Caimito area and order at least twice a week and so far the service has been amazing.  Yes, sometimes they dont have the complete order and they call me to switch some items which I dont really have an issue with.  The rare times in which they are delayed I call and they promptly check and give an answer, maybe they dont have enough delivery people or are actually overwhelmed by the orders, but then again this is a local service, its not uber, lyft or whatever other service you can think of.  And still the longest delay I could remember was around 2 hours, maybe 2.5.

All and all its a great service, maybe not  perfect but they do respond; and regarding refunds Ive never had an issue either.  In my case I order paying through ath movil and the refund is instant especially if you call them with an issue and they do the refund over the phone.

Overall I gave it a 5 maybe its a 4.5 but never a 3 or below.

Thats my 2 cents.; Terrible customer service. 72 hours no response from an incomplete order. Emailed customer service no response. No refund was issued. Now they don’t even respond my phone number, but I called via another number and they quickly responded. Every time we call it’s a new excuse and delay. They keep giving us the runaround about how they’re gonna add a new note in the system to have it settled the next day and nothing is getting done.; My order was placed 3/20/21, 7:45 never delivered, not a text, not a call, absolutelly ...disapointed; It's a Delivery Shopping on line Store and Groceries. Fine Service, Fine Inventory, Nice Customer Service Attention.; My experience so far has been excellent. They even called me because there were some products that were not available and they gave me the option to choose substitutes."

Ladies room was in horrible condition. Only one register open.; Self check out is 15 items or less would be fine but have more than 2 regular check outs open!  Sending people over that have 20 items to non self check out and make them wait in a long line is ridiculous.  Good thing Fry's hasn't adopted this stupid rule, they will have my business for now; The person at the bike racks argued with me for 10 minutes. 3rd trip of him messing up and refusing to give me what I asked for. Manager has been notified. I’ve biked to this Walmart three times now in order to get bike tires yet the employee would rather argue with me about him losing his job than let me grab what I need, walk to the front registers, and proceed to check out by myself. It is completely unacceptable for this to have happened. Yet another fail with Walmart and their aggressive employees. I’d love to share a several minute video I took of the employee arguing with me, acting clueless, and not taking any responsibility for his actions. He hides his name tag because I bet he’s reported often.

Trying to order stuff online and your picker failed to allow us replace items. It’s so bad our entire order is messed up. This Walmart is INCOMPETENT. Can’t even cancel our order. They mess up so badly and don’t care it costs us money.

Restrooms are messy every time I come in (pictured below). Staff isn’t productive enough for this high traffic of a store. Here’s some of the more common issues I’ve been noticing.

Today my visit was one of the worst. There were absolutely no bags for self checkout and even though EVERYONE was complaining, no staff brought out more. There was a young man working at self checkouts and refused to do anything about the bag situation. (Pictures below)

Stocking issues especially for deodorant. (Also pictured below) Go to frys instead and use a fuel points card and you’ll get these 6$ deodorants for 2.64 at frys, and they always have it in stock, unlike Walmart, which has been a constant battle. They never have the deodorant I need. I’ve switched brands multiple times but every time I switch, so does Walmart. It’s getting quite annoying.

This store is an honest nightmare. In a previous visit we needed to get some money orders, well nobody knows how to use the money order machine took our money and then wouldn’t print anything so had to waste my time to go to another Walmart to get it printed. We spent approximately 45 minutes at this Walmart just for them to send us away after failing to operate the money order machine.

I will continue to update my review on this Walmart until I’m satisfied as a customer. I think they need to prioritize cleanliness and organization, and we could definitely work on professionalism.

Garden is rarely stocked with any plants don’t even bother checking.; Purchased new tire here. Reasonable prices and good customer service but Cody forgot to put my rim cap back on. Waisted gas and time returning for my cap…. Have to rate at 3 stars; Customer service here was terrible. Why don't employees have any idea where items are? It wasn't a matter of language, because hand gestures always work, but having to run around until a more knowledgeable employee could help is ridiculous. I get that the store is in the midst of remodeling, but still. At least the cashiers and greeters were great. That's why I'm giving three stars."

The staff was all over the store organizing, stocking,  and cleaning. I noticed quite a few friendly elderly people working there and it really made me smile. It's nice to see people of all ages that need to work can get work here.  Self checkout is quick and efficient.; This Walmart has undergone a remarkable transformation, and I'm genuinely impressed. What used to be a practical choice for grabbing essentials turned into a more enjoyable experience. The revamped aesthetics have significantly improved the overall shopping environment. It no longer feels like just another generic big-box store; the changes are refreshing. Despite the longer drive from home, this has become my new Walmart of choice. The pictures may not fully capture it, but the difference is noticeable and appreciated.; The water refill here takes more than 8 minutes today for me.

Can you guys make sure that your machine works fine so that we don’t have to waste a lot of time just for refilling!; This particular store is clean and spacious. I hate shopping so I do order online a lot and go pick it up and they have never messed up my order. The associates are always friendly and courteous. I tip them even thought it's supposedly not allowed but if they are bringing my order to me to save me from going in the store, it is well worth it!; One of the BEST walmarts I ever been to!!!! I stopped shopping at Walmart for years but a few items my husband needed and this walmart was beautiful, massive and just so clean. Every walmart doesn't have a great vibe to me but this one definitely gives Target vibes lol. I would totally recommend this Walmart!"

Plenty of selection, grocery story only location, NOT a Super Center!! Can get keys copied here, buy lotto tickets etc, and even a claw machine! My go-to Walmart for sure. Very friendly and helpful staff; this location has a Pharmacy. They also have medical supplies here, and limited school supplies. And a Customer Service Center. Has self check out, and Cashiers to assist you. Best Walmart in the area by far; The worst Wilmart in America. Yesterday I bought chicken and there was not a lot of chicken because it was in the last hour before closing. I discovered that it had expired two days ago. I returned this morning to return it and replace it with a new one. I discovered that they brought more chicken and the expiration date is the same as before, and it is proven with pictures and today’s date is 6. June This is completely inappropriate behavior; I understand it was 11 minutes before close, but I knew exactly what I needed. This girl looked me dead eyed shook her head and just walked away as she locked the door. I sat in the parking lot making a call to my wife, cause I was there getting pull ups. But as I was making a call, I noticed another car pulled up a sorority looking chick hops out, same employee walks over and lets her in. Not pushing it in that direction but I don’t look like that sorority chick so why the discrimination. Also your open till 11, I was there at 1049.; I go to this store when I need something quick and Today was no different.
I have to say thank you you to 2 people who took the time to help me  Jonathan and Amy. I greatly appreciate your help and time. I hope you have a great week!!!; Holy Christmas music, Batman! The music in store was obnoxiously loud, and when I was getting into my car I could still hear the music from the lot. I feel for the people living across the street, and I really feel for the employees. They might want to be able to hear in their off time..."

He did offer me an alternative from the same winery and ordered me a 1/2 case. He stated if I didn't like it, I could return it. I was amazed just how far he went to help a random customer.

The employees listen, and have always sent me to the correct part of the store. They always explain the differences about products that are of interest to me. The pharmacy team is OUTSTANDING - They all deserve a raise, a bonus or a paid day off. I recommend this Walmart to everyone I know, I also recommend their pharmacy. Last but not least, the prices are great! This is the only store I shop at now; This company has closed more than half their self checkout registers so you get to wait around before you check out.
When I commented there must be a supply chain problem getting parts to fix cash registers, the attendant said, ""No, corporate decided to close all but 4 registers so PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT to encourage them to shop online.""
Hideous !  I am boycotting Walmart as of this minute.; This Walmart treats people like trash… unbelievable—- when you strategically approach the rotten employees to make sure you are friendly and cooperative THE EMPLOYEES STILL treat you the worst they can… absolutely unbelievable … I have seen them treat older people good and with laughs to go around… I guess I’ll have to dress up like and old grandma to be helped with respect…: wow,  that will be too much work… I’ll get used to be treated poorly… FOR   NO   REASON.  Think about it-  treating people poorly FOR NO REASON….i hope the employees turn off the “dislike” before they get home after work.; Super favourite place for shopping. Wide range of variety available in all categories. Grocery, pharmacy, clothing, meat and rest all categories are very great. Loved shopping here and very happy with purchase made. My 4 year old loved the Barbie cycle we purchased here. The staff helped us in choosing the best cycle for my kid and checked the condition of the cycle for us. Strongly recommend this store!; Once I’ve arrived and continued my shopping I had been kindly stopped by Kellz, one of the most best Walmart Employees throughout the store, as giving samples of protein shake drinks which was the biggest plus since I was currently in the market for some protein products and didn’t want to waste my time going to GNC, Kellz was the most respectful promoters while giving samples, kept it simple and easy!

The counter staff were awesome this afternoon. Thank you to the Pharmacy staff today; Kathleen and Kaitlin were amazing! For the last several months, Medicare has been pushing back on paying my prescription cost and both of these girls went out of their way to help me! The automated service was of no value. It indicated that my order was accepted and yet nothing happened. Very disappointing. How fortunate am I to have the folks at the pharmacy go out of their way to assist!; Refill rules met. Like the drive-thru option. Limited friendly staff and hours of operation. Will go back. Convenient distance for walk-in.; I've never had a problem having my prescriptions filled on time here and I've used them for around 5 years now.  Pharmacists and staff have all been friendly through the years.; Horrible communication and customer service. Prescriptions wouldn’t get filled, or they’d fill but wouldn’t communicate when it’s available. CVS stopped taking GoodRx, prescription price tripled, and I couldn’t fill my script on a Saturday when I’m out. When I told them you lost a customer they just said “OK” and didn’t try to make up for the constant issues I voiced. Terrible customer service and poor management."

This made me feel confident about the medication and next steps.  If you're looking for a friendly and helpful pharmacy, I highly recommend this CVS!; I had been without my synthroid for days and transferred it over to this location

I asked if they could fill it same day, as soon as possible and they had it ready in about an hour or hour and a half I don’t remember 🥹 which really helped me out

They were very helpful at pickup as well. This review is only for the pharmacy as I didn’t shop in the store; The service at this pharmacy has consistently gone downhill.  They treat you like they are the only place in town. It’s sad because if you had asked me five years ago, I would have highly recommended CVS and this location in particular. Now it feels like no one gives a flip about you and whether you come back.; The older female pharmacist is the rudest least helpful person I've ever had deal with at a pharmacy.

Add this to your next trip to San Juan!!; Booked a Sangria tasting through Airbnb and it was amazing. The Sangria is superb and is only fabricated in Puerto Rico not the mainland so it’s definitely worth tasting and purchasing a bottle to take home.

I drove down to the store and was immediately helped by a customer service representative. However, when she called the pick up order department, they didn’t rectify anything right away. It took the customer service representative three phone calls and 30 minutes of her hounding them for them to bring me the missing steak packets. On top of that no one offered me an apology; Always so clean and lovely people and staff.; There was a little bird in the produce section at Walmart. Management was notified of the little bird but when they arrived they didn't do a single thing! Instead they just stared at it and wondered what to do.

Everything else like continental US. The staff were mediocre, no sense of urgency at all. Always ask for the STEB bag, just in case you have to pass security again, don't get the fancy bag or you might have to throw liquor away.; Duty free shop that you have to walk through after passing through airport security, on the way to your gate. Plenty of employees to grab you. Usual cheap duty free prices. Lot lsnof liquor and perfume and cologne and cigarettes to choose from. Very clean and pretty well organized.; I am writing this email to inform you about an incident I came upon at the Dufry location at the San Juan airport. I bought a Kylie Lip kit from there and there was no tester for the item. I bought shade 108 dark red. I tried the dark red on my hand and it was almost tan. It was not the same as what was shown in the picture. When I went to return the item, I was told that I couldn’t because I tried it on my hand. I was told that if it’s been “used” they can’t take the item back even though I had just bought it. No where in the receipt did it state that rule. Even on the website it does not say they don’t take returns on open packages. I asked if I could exchange it to a shade I like and I was told no. The cashier said I tried on the tester so I should have known what the shade was like, but they did not have a tester for that shade. The cashier spoke to us in a rude demeanor. Stared us down as we were shopping as if we were going to steal. I absolutely did not appreciate this as I felt profiled for my race. I am extremely disappointed with my experience and the costumer service at this location. I was unable to return or exchange my item, I was given no help to go on about the situation, the lady that helped me was rude and seemed to profile based on appearances, and now I have a 31 dollar lipstick that I know I will never end up using. I hope the company can make this right.; I was being followed in the store by an employee Manuel the whole time. He didn’t speak until I found a bottle and he took it from me stating he was bringing it to the front. I have a problem with this because he did not do that to anyone else in the store. In other words I was profiled. Just a heads up if you are tan/brown be prepared to have your dignity tarnished.; I wish I could give them zero stars. I order my alcohol online and went to the store to pick it up and was over charged. I was told that the transaction was cancelled, and the new order would be the only one charged to my card. I have called them every day since I got back home, and they still charged my card 179.20 plus the new transaction. I have emailed them and no response this is unacceptable to treat people that brings your company business. I will not do business with Dufry again. I am beyond pissed."

You need to wait at least one hour to take covid test if there are 5 cars in front of you.  Just pick up the medicine you have to wait 20 munites minimum. They closed lunch break even some people wait on the line. Told me to return at 2pm. Unbelievable
Worst service.; I don’t understand why they offer online appointments for the COVID-19 vaccine if once you get there you have to wait in line with people that DON’T have appointments. The person doing check-in is the same  one administering the vaccine. So disappointing and frustrating.; The WORST service in the pharmacy. They don’t  have employees. There 4 people in the line and the wait to leave a prescription is one hour.
PLEASE!!!! change the horrible music and its HIGH volume, they want to run out instead of staying to buy. It's no pleasure to stay in the pharmacy.; It's a shame that I can't give a zero-star rating.  I mistakenly sent a prescription to that pharmacy.  I stopped sending prescriptions to Walgreen's because every time I do so I have to wait for a long time despite requesting the preparation of said prescription in advance.

They take credit cards over $5.; Everything is extremely overpriced, there's always prostitutes hanging around outside the store and the owner is very very rude.

My wife was attacked one night and asked the owner for help or if she could use the phone and some paper towels to clean blood off herself and to call 911, and he looked at her and said no he didn't have any napkins or anything and told her to get out all while he proceeded cleaning up her blood off his counter with a paper towel....

It's insane not only that but you have to wait hours and hours to get them filled. The girls in the pharmacy are really nice but I really think you guys need to hire more people and stop overworking them. Do better Walgreens!!; I have recently switched from another store and pharmacy to this Walgreen's and I'm just so delighted!  I have a husband who's had a stroke and I have to keep track of all of his meds plus keep myself healthy!!  I just am so blessed that I found this Walgreen's on Grand Ave and their wonderful staff!! I was so taken for granted by the other store I left after being with them for over a year.  When I found this store if was such a relief!!  Not only do they take the time to explain the medications to me, but the staff in the store also go out of their way to make me feel like family!!
In this day and age that's amazing!!
The store manager is Mikey and his amazing staff includes Leslie and Radha who have helped me so much even with finding the right product throughout the store!!  We're on medicare and they make sure I've found the product that is covered as well!!!  I can't thank them enough!!
At the pharmacy, the manager Taylor is amazing as well as her staff Ben, Celeste and the whole team.  I always feel like they have time to explain everything to me even if there's a line!!  Now that's a store where I want to shop!!
If you're not happy with your current store and pharmacy I highly recommend you try this Walgreen's on Grand Ave!!! I know you'll be very pleased!!!; Is this Walgreens for you? If you like to wait in a line for 20 mins while employees  able to assist sit around in photos enjoying their Starbucks. Then yes this Walgreens is going to be a great fit.

On a more serious note. I have been to this Walgreens a handful of times. I have had maybe 2 good experiences. The good visits came from a friendly young man up front taking pride in his job and being friendly.

A simple expectation from customers spending their hard earned cash.

However, the reality is that 90% of the time this Walgreens down right sucks. This Walgreens has rude and lazy staff.

I literally never leave reviews for anything today is the day that changed. Unfortunately it has not been from stellar experiences. I like to consider myself fair and understanding.

My bare minimum expectation for a customer service employee is to be helpful. These employees are not.

An example from a recent experience has been a common theme at this store compelling me to finally voice my opinion and ultimately switch pharmacies entirely.

I ordered photos at 9am according to the app they would be ready by 1pm the same day. At 3:30pm I went to pick up my photos and a script. Upon arriving I waited at the photos line while the employee assisted another customer. Once that customer had been serviced I continued to wait for the employee to greet me. Attempting to respect the employee’s time I waited a few more moments. Occasionally this employee would glance up with an annoyed look. Assuming the employee needed a few more minutes to finish whatever it was they were doing I left to go grab my script.

This was an experience on its own but I will give the benefit of the doubt and assume the technician was new.

This whole exchange left that employee at photos for roughly 10 minutes. Upon coming back I walked up and said “Hello” the employee just stared at me for a second, sighed, and rudely asked “what do you need help with”
No worries… maybe she had a bad day.

“I’m here to just pick up some photos I ordered this morning.”

“name.” She rudely responded.

After about 2 minutes of her fiddling around looking for my order she says

“I don’t see it”

I double check to ensure I ordered at the right location gave first name, last name, order number. She cannot find my order no big deal. She has yet to look in the system. When I asked her to maybe check with the order number she finally was able to pull it up. It wasn’t ready. Instead of taking ownership of the situation she responded rudely
“ it won’t be ready anytime soon. We had 3 people call out blah blah blah blah.” Excuses for her sh*t attitude.

My frustration is not from the fact the photos weren’t ready. Things happen. My frustration is the lack of assistance and rude attitudes that seem to be a common theme here. This was just the last straw. I have always loved Walgreens and since moving out here this one has been the closest. These expirence have led to switch drug stores entirely I have moved my scripts and now will be driving out of my way for them. Not a big deal just disappointed. For photos and other things Amazon continues to be the best solution.

I don’t intend for other customers to read my long review. My hope is to leave some feedback for whoever it may concern.
I think most people are realistic and don’t expect over the moon customer service on their casual Walgreens trip, but with that I think most people want to spend their money with companies that appreciate their employees and customers. This business doesn’t do either, Clearly their employees don’t want to show up for work and the ones that do put forth their most minimal effort with goal to be as sour as possible.

If you happen to visit this Walgreens I hope you have an amazing experience.
They won’t get another chance from me and if your experiences are similar I suggest you do the same thing and find a new drug store!; Just got done getting some passport pictures for my Son and myself, Patrick was a true gentleman, he really made sure we were taken care of properly and was very courteous and helpful!; The cashier asked if I wanted to use the coupon under my name, I received 10.00 off my order. Thank you Walgreens. It's about time. Here it is March. But at last I received one!!"

We spend hundreds of dollars in this store as local residents of Mira Lagos Neighborhood.

We purchased our drinks and purchased ginger ale over the weekend. The ginger ale had a horrible consistency, so we returned it yesterday and the clerk was kind enough to allow us to exchange it.

Today, we tried the ginger ale again with same result, so we went back to return it and to advise the store the entire batch might likely be bad. Unlike the clerk yesterday, the guy today told me it was ""my problem and the manufacturer"" and he did not honor my return.

As a business you are responsible for the product you sell; not the manufacturer. You can take those issues up with the manufacturer during your next re-stock, but do not make your customers pay for poor quality products sold in your store.

Needless to say, it wasn't even about the money being returned; it's poor customer service and unprofessionalism that we should not have experienced.

I can’t speak for anyone else’s experience there, but Kamish and Ryan our far and above what you would expect from a general hospitality staff. Always helpful the couple times I’ve been there. Always a smile and a positive word. They are an example of what it means to take pride in your work! You can tell it’s always genuine by the vibe you get in there from beginning to end! Positive people are out there still, and I count myself blessed to have met the two gentlemen above, even if for only a short time! Great example guys! Keep setting it!!!; Good selection, but prices way to high... Bought a tall bottle of 1800 Tequila it was $60 ... Most the other places I've been is for  $40.....

I understand if it were a Razorback Game or something where multiple vehicles would take spots would be a Problem but the Liquor store was slow with about all there lots empty with very few customers going inside on a Friday afternoon. There were other vehicles from the same event parked there before us and they singled us out for ours to be towed. This is what's wrong with America. For one employees shouldn't be blocking there signs so people can see them. Two it should not have been an issue today at the time they had my Vehicle towed.

The store is clean, well-organized, and has a wide selection to choose from. It's also quite spacious, making it easy to browse without feeling cramped. Overall, a top-notch liquor store!; The only place I go to in the area.  They have such a great selection and always give good recommendations.  I also love the allocation drawings that they do for the more difficult to find bourbons.  Have got some really good bourbons, tequilas and wines, we would not have tried otherwise.  Seeing some of these other reviews,  you need to remember that not everyone likes the same thing.  I love the taste of Blantons OTR but know others that don’t like it at all.; I don’t not recommend this store ! I purchased a tequila from this establishment that was referred from another tequila I considered! A 95 dollar tequila at that! It was deplorable! In the north east..  if you purchase a subpar tequila  especially if it was referred they’ll exchange for a better option. This place tucked their tails and said it’s not their problem. Nonetheless I will never return to this establishment because of that. I’ll take my business somewhere else! I do not recommend. They recommend a non selling tequila thinking I wouldn’t know the difference. I DID. Go to hell.; great store. big choice. I would have made the choice a little more inexpensive prosecco."

Needless to say it was absolutely delicious

Wonderful customer service wonderful selection; Have always had great service at this store, but I recently ordered a keg of beer and it turned out to be bad.  I took the nearly full keg back to the store expecting a battle to get a refund.  To my surprise, Rich called me the next day from the store and apologized profusely and immediately offered a refund.  Plus, he said he felt like he needed to do more and started to offer something else when I told him the refund would be just fine.  In this day when people are constantly trying to screw you out of something, and denies all responsibility or ownership for anything, this place is above all that.  The people here are extremely courteous and helpful, and the prices are very good.  Plus their location is great.  I will never go anywhere else.  Thanks to the staff at South Walton Spirits, and a big thank you to Rich!!"

I bought an item which was damaged and when I went to return it with the receipt. The guy threatened to call the cops on me, after he said they will only give me credit which I declined. He started yelling  at me, became very aggressive and said ( you must not know who you dealing with ). He asked me to leave his store without my money or he will call the cops.

I told them to call the cops I will wait and while I was outside of the store waiting for the cops, the guy  came outside and handed me my money back and told me to never come back.

I believe they must be dealing with many people who don’t know their rights because this is not the first time I have seen them being hostile to their customers specially when you are black. I will never go back I wouldn’t recommend.

To everyone reading this. Have a lovely day ❤️; When I lived here. The store owner spit in a black young lady's face. And then he called the police on her. Hes going to mess with the right person one day. And that person is not going to care about going to jail.; We were considering renting a place in this complex and stopped at this store prior to going inside the office. The store owner is a real sadistic nazi. How this complex even allows him to have a store here? We will never be back. Avoid this place like a plague!; Lou and his family are always nice to me.  And this store is the major reason that I still live in the building.; I've lived here for over two years, the owners are wonderful! But they need more Middle Eastern & Mizrachi kosher foods."

Thank you! There are not many such places in Finland, where you can buy some small details and parts for your home.
A few ideas to improve still:
-Return process is super slow.
-Also quality of goods sometimes is not good.; All kinds of things at a discounted price, mostly because stuff has labels in the wrong language or the packaging is the old design. Stock changes all the time, but you will definitely find something to buy every time. Store is very little and fit to bursting with products, so prams and wheelchairs have very little (if any) room to manoeuvre.; The only Säiturinpörssi in East Helsinki and also Tokmanni to buy stuff for home; You can find almost anything in cheap price from this shop.; I always find cheap interesting offers of everyday use items"

Just thought you would want to know. 😁; This Kroger location is decent and they usually have a good stock of fresh foods.
Would love for Kroger just to give discounts up front instead of forcing coupon clipping on the app or paper coupons to save. If you can afford to get the coupons and discounts, why not give the cheaper price for every single person??; This is the biggest grocery store I think I've ever been to. I got lost on my first visit. I see why the curbside pick up is popular. Deli selection of prepared food could have been better, but maybe was a busy day. I'll try again in the proper hiking gear.; This is a very nice. Kroger in a nice location. I'm only giving 4 stars since several of the salads were out of stock and the supply of fruit was a bit low.; Consistently out of staples like milk. The selection and pricing is terrible (especially for milk).  Fruit and veggie choices/ quality are suspect and soil way too quickly.
I frequently find broken eggs that have been cleaned and placed back in the container. Opened/unsealed soup containers that were placed back on the shelves. Use as a last resort, they don't care at all here."
