The music is good, the club is clean, the owner runs it well, and the women are gorgeous! I met the owner and he is so humble and nice. If u want to have a good time this is the place!🍾🍾; The place has serious potential! But it's coming up short still.

1- get an up to date web site with weekly updates.
2- commit to music nights. 2 different music genre's max per night(that compliment each other) . With updates on the website as to what night is what music.
3- turn the lights down more on the dance floor.

Those 3 are free. And will immediately impact business for the good. If you want more you need to hire me as a consultant. My resume is impeccable. I can turn your place into a multi million dollar establishment.

I've been there recently and I gotta say.... Your can do much much better. Contact me.; The club seems a little run down in some places but the vibe is definitely right. They had great music playing all night long and it was a variety of different genres. But the thing that really put them over the top to me and why I gave a 5 star rating is simply because of water bottles. I asked for water and got a bottle at no charge. The places I usually go to always want to charge for bottles and give cups out for free. So the fact that I got a water bottle truly had my mind blown. Definitely worth a trip or two.; Worst club I've ever been to! Way too many ugly people, too many lights it was bright inside on the dance floor making it uncomfortable and weird to dance near anyone. VIP didn't even come with a bottle
Nor did not cover entrance fee. You pay $100~$200 for a table only. Spilled drinks every where! Dirty floors! I agree they do have corrupt security staff. I Witnessed three different times when the security belittled three different customers. Even grabbing a female aggressively without any type of struggle on her side as they drag her outside. The music sucks, it was very humid and hot inside. I would not recommend this place to anyone.; Honestly it's a pretty lit place. Great music & drinks. Had a great time with my girls. The only bad thing I can say is that there was nothing but ugly ass guys, so ladies don't go expecting to find a prince charming. 😂😂😂 oh and also $10 CASH to get in....even ladies smhhhh."

If you can't trust security, you can't trust your safety in a place. I asked for a VIP cover to skip the line. $20/person. Fine, done. He seemed surprised I agreed...  Then waited until after I gave him cash to mention there's an additional cover to get past the door. Seriously dude, why not do some basic math & be straight with me? Whatever... $5/person he says... No big deal. Get to the door cashier. $10/person she tells me. I explain. She says they're separate covers & it's $10/person. You know, separate charges are whatever... I was celebrating and budgeted at least a couple hundred... But to not be straight with me about something as simple as money...? Yea, I'm not having it. Done! Left and went to the place next door: $10 each, no line, & variety of fun music.; It’s a fun place to go and have drinks and fun with your friends on the weekend. Great DJ mixing up your favorite songs. Keep in mind this place is very small so I definitely recommend getting a table for yourself because it does get crowded very quickly. I’m talking elbow to elbow crowded with people squeezing by you and spilling their drink on your favorite shoes. A place like this you won’t even know which guy grabbed your butt; Two of my lady friends were physically assaulted by a male patron in this bar last night. Two security guards and the manager did nothing to stop the man - their response was to kick out my friends for ""making a big deal out of nothing."" It was far from nothing. Businesses have a responsibility to protect their patrons, especially when alcohol is involved. This place proved they are unwilling to do that, which means they do not deserve any business. Stay away from this place!; The service was terrible the music was ok. But the system is way to big for that tiny space. So some high pitch noises would come out the speakers! Horrible. I will never go there again! Also they said 8 of my guest were suppose to get in free. But they charged them anyways. I booked my birthday there. Big mistake; If I could give this place -1 I would.... I made reservations for my fiancé birthday a week in advance. They said we'll see you Friday!! Well when we got there Friday night at 11:30pm they had already gave our table away. If there was a certain time we had to be there they would've told us not just give our table away. Or at least give us a call it's not like they didn't have our number. Why ask for our name and number and not even us it. So worthless"

Definitely I'm going this weekend. 👌; The club can get lit but..I don’t know if they just hired non-experienced bartenders because the drinks were weak as hell, literally tasted like virgin drinks. Get VIP service if possible with the hookah as it’s a good experience. If not buy only beer and or pregame because the cocktails were highly disappointing.; Absolutely nobody in the dance floor, and for a $10-15 cover charge, insane. A scam, there was maybe 4 booths each with a few people at them, the rest were completely empty. very dead, probably from location and marketing, has so much potential to be great, just can’t fire it out I guess 🤷🏼‍♀️; Best night ever if buy a bottle for 150 or 200 you  get a VIP table plus add 40 dollar hookah or for the low pay 50 you get a small table and comes with a bucket beer of choice… first time here definitely come back; Paid $60.00 cover charge, they didn't have seating for us since we didn't have reservations. Bottle service is $300.00 and recommended by the usher. We felt unwelcome and got out with our money back."

I’m never coming back here to charge me that amount.; They usually have lights on and too much of a restaurant vibes. The DJ sucks really bad. Doesn’t know how to transition to different musics. Just went your getting the good beat, they change to were it’s slow and quiet. Kinda kills the vibe; Postpandemic I arrived just before last call to a polite attractive male bouncer. He gave me a quick run down if how I was to proceed. There is no dancing, I was to remain wearing my mask until I was seated at my table I believe the rule is if you are not seated at your table you have to have your mask on. I was surprised by not seeing the dance floor packed with dancers, instead tables took their place. I was allowed to go out onto the patio smoking area without a mask and the small group of about 10 people out there unmasked. Final thoughts; depends on what your expectations might be. Personally it was nice to get out and even though the crowd was very minimal I enjoyed my $5 picther of beer and people watching. On observing other groups and how they were having fun. This pandemic has everything all messed up but this club has been around for a long time and I would hate to see it go away because of financial problems. We know it's potential I hope we can all try to keep it going while protecting ourselves and others. Bottom line I had a good time. Just be prepared for something a little different than what we're used to. Let's support our local businesses especially gay owned.; I’m not worth your time after time and time again your establishment had wrongfully accused of actions such as “throwing the fist sucking punch” or “causing a fight” when I tried to explain to your establishment that I came up to the party as an individual on my own asking what the issue was, yes I had my heels off and hair tied because it was hot but I asked what the issue was and left. “The party” that I was with who actually threw the first punch should be banned permanently because I am no longer affiliated with that party and tend to start issues for no reason. Moral of the story: THID CLUB IS SO UNPROFESSIONAL!!!; Tipped the dj for a Latino song and waited 20 minutes but they only played English music. False advertisement"

The free clubs in the area are more clean than this place; Place was very unprofessional and their security are wanna be phx police. They beat on their customers. I watched security concuss a few different individuals that they had a “problem” with. Liquor license should be revoked and/or shut down; Kind of simplistic for a bar, felt like it was a off shore island diy bar. Gave off budget vibes. The drink I had was very delicious though so their menu is something to check out. Music was pretty good, I got in a dance or two. All and all I recommend you check this place out; Weak drinks. Sub-par drag show that lasted 45mins. Asked for singles for tipping the performers, was told no singles available but only $2 bills.; Had a misunderstanding with the staff , spoke with TJ , He resolved the issue in a professional manor and would suggest to anyone with a problem to speak directly to him , great place ,good drinks and  awesome music ."

I went because it was Old School Hip Hop night. I got to check out the bar, and meet the awesome DJ. I found the drinks to be expensive, but that's anywhere so if you can't afford it then don't drink or don't go out.

The place was very cool. It's only been opened about 2 months and they will be opening a karaoke night soon.

Bathrooms were very clean. Floors inside were clean, and the outside patio is clean.

The tables are not seating. They are reserve only so it's about $200 a table. Otherwise the inside is a dance floor. Seating on the patio is nice but scarce if it's a busy night.

I'll absolutely be back!; I was super excited to visit Thundercat Lounge for the first time a few weeks ago, but after a disappointing first experience I don't think I'll be back.

The security guard wouldn't let me bring in my nail clippers, which isn't an issue I've had at any other bar/venue. It was felt like such a hassle over something so small. It set the tone for the night.

The drinks were super small and weak for the price we paid, which was I think somewhere around $15 per drink. I also watched the bartender who made my drinks on the 2nd round sniff almost every metal shaker she picked up before using it, and it made me paranoid if they were properly cleaned or not.

I will admit the inside IS beautiful. The checkerboard dance floors, mirror ceiling, and pastel 80's themed restrooms made for a fun, visually pleasing space to be in. However, a lack of fans in the main space means the dance floor heats up quick. My friends and I found after a few songs we'd have to leave because it got too hot with the amount of people on the floor.

There's more I could add, but these were my main critiques of this venue and the reasons I won't be returning in the near future. I was excited for this place to open up, so I'd love for them to take this feedback to improve.; Free Form Thursdays at Thundercat have been a blast!! No cover, amazing music, and awesome festival art vendors on the patio!

Sound system is awesome inside and the security / staff are laid back and welcoming!; Absolutely love being here, such a unique and nostalgic atmosphere right off the bat with the neon themed room and awesome stage with all the works. Sound was really great, as well as the drinks! Love the variety of dance nights here, something for everyone. Definitely worth checking out, good vibes and good people.; We went to 80's Take on Me night for a friend's birthday.  We had an absolute blast! Danced the night away. We got a vip table, which is totally worth it if u want a place to leave your purse and drink while dancing. Our cocktail waitress was wonderful and the drinks and fun shots were yummy 😋  I highly recommend checking it out!"

I stopped by with some old college buddies. This is definitely a younger crowd and a bit out of my age demographic, but this place really gets jumping at night.

If you're not hip to the club scene like us old timers. It's cool to have a couple of stiff drinks, jam out to the music, and just people watch.

If you are a club hopper and under the age of 35, the Riot Hose is the place to be.
The drinks are deliciously strong and served by sexy and scantily clad lady bartenders, which I certainly do not mind.

For a price, you can reserve a table, which I believe comes with bottle service.

Overall, we had a good experience. However, we did not dine here and have no clue what the food is like.; the promoter Antonio is the absolute best. Sundown Promotions really hooks it up at Riot House with great drinks and company!!! the bar was also really good and music was such a vibe; Visited in the middle of July on a Friday and it was busy but no wait to get in. No cover charge. Bottle service and booths available. Everyone is dancing, it's not awkward to be there. Even though it's open-air they do a good job of keeping the place cool (ish) on 100+ nights. It was tolerable. Plenty of drink options and hard seltzers.; The ambiance of Riot House was a vibe and the service was great! The DJ played a good variety of music and the crowd wasn’t too much. Definitely would recommend Riot House for your next night out!; Very poor management!!! As a business owner myself we have a responsibility to protect our customer and general public. I attended a bachelorette party with my girlfriend who had a section with her girls who kept getting bothered, approached and touched by the table next to them. My girlfriend and I ended up going to cake for a better crowd. Not long after we ended up getting a call from the remaining bachelorette party that one girl was on the ground bloody and the other was on the way to jail. What happened was once we left (and I being the only male) went to Cake the table of guys next to them moved in. We witnessed it while we were there but several times I kept them at bay. Once we left they again made contact with the girls and one girl defended the rest after he touched her and swung on the guy. Security ended up stopping the girl, blooding her face and told the police they (security) got assaulted. Never once did they mention the negligence of protecting their patrons. An innocent girl went to jail tonight. I spoke with police for over 30 minutes to even get a case number and they argued with me about the definition of assault which is the unwanted physical contact to another person. Non negotiable!! They refused to give any additional information or find the guys who assaulted the women to start the entire thing. If you’re a women and celebrating anything at all, DO NOT GO HERE!!! Case information is displayed below. Pretty women need protection while out and this club provides ZERO! Find another club!!"

A friend of mine doesn't drink an ordered ginger ale and was charged $15 the bartenders don't take orders very well or listen to customers needs. The dj downstairs played some old ass hip pop n r n b for the most part had a cool little mix but an old mix. Rooftop was coo with a house dj but was hot up there; We go here just for the food 😋...

The club is great & the DJs are always amazing, but the food is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌😋😍!!!!!; I went this weekend for girls night and stepped to the side to allow the rest of my friend group to get ID’d because I was the first in line and one of the bouncers came up to me with the audacity to tell me to “step to the back of the line if I’m broke”. I stepped to the side to be respectful to everybody walking in and out and to have somebody who’s supposed to be there to keep me “safe” talk to me so disrespectful was absolutely crazy. Never again! If you wanna have a good time go next door to the other clubs. Worst experience ever. Forgot to mention the weirdo went on and on about not letting me in because I said something back to him. Power trippers fr!; This was an awesome experience. One of a kind, CAN NOT BE MISSED. The DJ was spinning some great tracks on the roof top dance floor. The bar staff is on top of it.

They hold events, throw parties, have live bands and DJs, 2 full bars maybe even more outside when it is not so hot during summer. The sports bar is very impressive tons of massive tvs with all the games on, for every sport. It really is an unbelievable place. The lay out allows for the sports bar and the dance lounge to go on at the same time and not interfere with each other. The place is so clean and esthetically pleasing to.

NEVER AGAIN! I’ve been to some of the most expensive places in this country and I’ve NEVER paid $30 for bottom shelf liquor. There was more juice in that glass than liquor!
We walk over near the dance floor to sit at a table. My friend orders hookah the waitress tells us it takes 45 minutes to warm up. WHAT?! I’m not new! It DOES NOT take almost an HOUR! This place wasn’t even crowded 🙄 We could not drink our watered down $60 drinks fast enough and left before the hookah warmed up 🤭🙄
As we walked out I tried speaking to one of Security guards at door, don’t waste your time. He couldn’t speak English or seemed to not understand me.; Angel is the best. Really enjoyed his service he really gives you a good vibe and hypes you up. He’s always around to make sure your cup is never empty. 100% recommend him. Ask for Angel 😊; Very disappointed they said doors open at 9 they opened at 9:30 100 for a table??? Apache is not coming out till 12 and that’s if is the original guys at the door very rude never coming back; I'm definitely not coming here again, they have a very bad organization, we made a reservation of weeks to come and see T3R ELEMENTO and the worst thing is that we arrived early to get our table reserved for the same reason that they do not respect our reservation and it is not the first time apart the sound of the music is of terrible quality, so much money that they steal that they do not complex to buy professional equipment, I have a bad experience, if I could I would give them 0 stars! NO RECOMENDÓ ESTE COCHINERO DE ANTRO!!; If I could I would give 0 stars, I had a very bad experience in this night club,we reserved a table to see T3r elemento and when we arrived the table they had already given it to other people and they gave us a table where all the people passed by and they even throw our alcohol because we were in the way, it doesn't seem fair to me that we came to have fun and they ruined us are night, I’ll definitely never come back here"

Or if there's nothing else in Arizona to do.  The waitress in our ViP area was awesome. But the place gets so packed, and there were a few fights brewing. The dj really really sucked. In both the hip hop and Spanish side. They kept talking. The whole time  and wouldn't shut up!! The hip-hop side kept playing the same songs. I heard scooby doo Papa like 3 times! I've been here a few times and I think this last time will be my last time.; This was my first time here for the Mi Vida Loca meet & greet and I was amazed with this establishment it's so lively and fun.; Club Dwntwn is always a fun time. They play decent music and have multiple rooms. I come here fairly often and always have a good time. I would recommend going with the VIP entrance because it is a better experience. If you do not, you have to hang in crowded areas and it is difficult to get a bartenders attention. In the VIP section there is walking room and a more private bar. Security is on point at this club, they try their best to make sure everyone is behaving. There are a few things I would say could use some work. The bathrooms are straight out of a horror movie, super small and congested. Last night there there was a toilet cover on one of the seats, just dangerous to have around drunk people. I would also say maybe upgrade to their other rooms, I checked one out for the first time and it was scary back alley vibes. I will be sticking to the main room.; I’ve been curious about this place, simply because there really isn’t much out there with Latin/Hisp music—it’s scarce. It caught my attention also because on the website it stated there was a dress code and to “dress to impress.”  We went a bit early but were a bit surprised to see that the cover charge was cash only (doesn’t state on website).  We had to walk over to the ATM at the Grand. Walking in, there weren’t that many people but we did come early, which gave us the chance to get accommodated. We went to the dance floor on the back and the bar there, only took cash. Let me say, for a simple vodka soda, it was $12. A little steep.

We started dancing and went between the dance floors. Fairly good music but it got so packed, it was no longer fun. The DJ spoke to much—felt I was at a Mexican wedding or quinceñera.

And that dress code?  Laughable. Men walking in with Nike tshirts, sneakers and a few with baseball hats. It was ridiculous to see that their website says one thing but they don’t honor it at the door. Certainly didn’t have the feel I was going for, when an establishment says “dress code or dress to impress.”  Impress who?

Can’t really say anything negative about the staff tho. All of the ones I came across were nice and respectful. I may or may not return. Not sure. I can drive a little extra to Scottsdale and not have a cover charge, where they’s actually a dress code and drinks cost the same.; Visited this club last Saturday or I say clubs and in more than one. We were hanging out having drinks and heard more music we looked behind us there was another room with another set of music playing. We dance a little and had another drink and a door slid open and you guessed it another room with a different tone playing. Definitely a great Spanish club. There were different types of dancing going on in the different rooms. You should definitely check it out, different vibez."

The bartenders were extremely friendly and efficient, serving drinks quickly. The air-conditioned space was a welcome plus. The music selection was diverse, featuring Latin, hip hop, reggaeton, pop, and rock genres. The crowd was varied, with most patrons ranging from their early 20s to 30s, creating a very safe and enjoyable environment. With three dance floors and reasonably priced drinks, I will definitely be returning!; Pretty cool club. Went with friends.

There are 3 dance floors. From my experience there;
-top floor is house music/ Edm
-middle floor is a mix of everything
- bottom floor is Latin music.

Service is cool. Only issue is the music switch on the middle floor didn’t make sense at times and was a turn off.

Definitely coming back though; Absolutely love Club 54!! Best party in town, drinks are always good and the music keeps you dancing all night long!! 3 floors of non stop music! If you come here, you’re in for an absolute awesome time!; Love love love Club 54! Beautiful club with 3 stories of non stop music with great vibes. We had the best time. We will definitely be back! 💕; Dress code is up to the discretion of the bouncer. Inconsistent and unfortunately they discriminate. I’d save money and go somewhere else. Girls can wear sandals but if a guy wears sandals, they cannot. Go somewhere else. Their sign doesn’t even mention open toed shoes. I mean it’s California…"

Go for the music and dancing. I do NOT recommend ordering food because of the challenge with waitress service. Hopefully, this was just an off day…because I’m used to experiencing outstanding customer service!

Protect your JOY even when there is nonsense!; Great place to come.dance and have a good time. Drinks were cool.service was great. I do recommend if your local..; I didn't have anything to eat and I drank only water... But I had a blast!!! They had a DJ that played myriad of 70's, 80's and some 90's hits! A live band from 11pm-12am. This time they had a Maná tribute band that played very well and, in my opinion, very similar to the real band. It has a $15 cover charge which I think was a great deal since you get to dance and listen to a real band in between. You may dress however you like but to me, it looked very casual and casual dressy.. some went too dressy. Many were wearing converse or flats, jeans and t-shirt. We had a lot of fun and will definitely be going there again! I suggest you check what tribute bands will be playing and getting there early to get some seats. There's VERY limited seating space and tables. I'm not sure about the food because we didn't get there early enough.🤔 I thought I saw some plates with finger foods but I'm not sure. 🤷🏻‍♀️ One thing I know for sure, you'll have great fun and you'll enjoy yourself.; Everything was great except for the live band that we had that night. I couldn’t understand anything they were saying. He was mumbling and his mouth was literally over the mic so you couldn’t hear anything.; Great spot for a drink and some dancing. Love the live tribute bands. They serve Space Dust 🌌🚀 so I was cool with showing up. Music is great and the dance floor was live and happening. I've seen Green Day and a Social Distortion Tribute bands already and I will be there for many more. Always have fun here."

Unfortunately yesterday there was an incident that occurred that left me , as a customer , disappointed. I don’t mind spending money for drinks , as long as the drinks are GOOD! To start of the night, I ordered a margarita. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to reach my go to bartender because he was busy. Since there was others, I decided to order. The drink was NOT GOOD. The margarita, was peer lemon.. I couldn’t swallow because of how acidic it tasted, I  even asked my friends, if they tasted the same thing. They all agreed. I kindly asked the bartender, if he could re make it or add more alcohol because it was peer lemon. He told me, to add more alcohol, I’d have to pay. I said no, then remake it. He declined. How are you going to make me pay, for a drink that I can’t swallow? I was very upset and made it clear how upset I was. I didn’t consume the drink at all. I kindly requested another bartender, he was very attentive and asked what was wrong with my drink, he understood. I asked him to please throw away the drink and make me a new drink. (I still paid for the new drink). DB Lounge was my go to spot, definitely there is some bartenders that do not care about customer service. Customer service is super important, especially in a night life establishment. Management , please train the bartenders to be more customer friendly. Now , I’d have to pick another go to club from now on.; When I turned 21, this was the club I wanted to attend because I love dancing and socializing with my dancing, and now since I first attending, there are only two clubs I regularly attend now: La Mirage and Club DB Lounge. I know some people have their issues or problems when it comes to clubs, but in my experience, it’s always added to some of my best experiences, going out, dancing and just loving it so much! I highly recommend coming here when you first turn 21 and want to experience clubbing on a different scale!; Very pleasant place to relax, drink and dance the night away. Security and bartenders were very profesional and friendly.; I want to speak to the owner . I want a real reason why am I banned for ever ? Adam descriminate people ! He’s rude . No reason what’s so ever .  The place is nice , is just the manager. First we were told we weren’t allow for a year and now they said never . I need some explanation. It’s unfair .; Had a bachelorette party there don't recommend.  Security really meses things up I didn't think that would be an issue for us but they just meddle to the point where it gets intrusive.  Would never go back."

The atmosphere in the other hand was great! Loved that they had a live band playing and a DJ. We danced the night away. Overall we had a great

I would recommend getting a VIP table so you can avoid standing the whole evening. The drinks are priced fine, and the DJ always plays great 80's. I recommend going to see cover bands like, Selena, Bruno Mars and Madonna.

Parking is a bit of an issue, I would recommend parking across the street, Ubering or arriving at 9 pm or sooner to get parking.

My Wife and I are looking in returning sometime this year. If you have not been to here, give it a shot if you love 80's music.; This place has a good vibe but totally not worth it.
First the parking is small you have to get there early & I mean super early to get parking. Once you find a parking space you have to get in line to get in. Once you’re in & ready to pay the cover charge is cash only. They do have a ATM machine inside but their is also a huge line to use it. Don't forget to bring your ID otherwise you won't be able to get in. The security guard was nice & let me go get in from my car. He made sure I did not loose my place in line.

The way I took it, They let the VIPs go in first. Others wait in line. Once you get in, if you did not reserve a vip table you will be seated on the worst part of the club. I will call it the boring section. There are only a few small TVs and I mean small TVs, tables & chairs you would not be able to see the stage. There is this huge wall covering the stage. The club is shape like a J. I’m my opinion it’s the worst shape for a club.  Once you get out to the dance floor it’s a really good vibe the music is nice the people are drinking having a good time.

The drinks are good reasonably priced. I recommend the big fish bowl. It’s comes with a flashing ice cube making it look really nice. It’s big enough to last you the whole night. I did not try the food so I can’t review the food. I also did not like that the waitress keeps your credit card to run a tap, I get it, but that made me a little uncomfortable. The waitress was super nice very attentive to us.

Would I recommend this place only if you reserved a VIP table otherwise no I don’t, save your money there are better places out here.; This is a great spot.  We came here on Thursday and the DJ (DJ Whiskey) was mixing great songs from the 80s & 90s.  Plenty of seating area, very big dance floor.  The drinks are very generous and well made, best part there was no cover charge.

The only drawback is there are only 20 or so parking spaces and there is nowhere else to park.; Some good friends surprised me and took me out to the Total 80's Bar and Grille to see The Doors cover band, Strange Days Tribute. Had a blast.  It felt like I went back in time and experienced the 70's that night. Thanks gang.; The parking lot is so tiny, the security is so strict and its cash only to enter. The vibe is definitely off the music wasn’t so great either, we arrived af 8:30 and left around 10. The place is small as-well and you cant find anywhere to sit. You def cant enjoy yourself even on the dance floor you’re constantly being watched by security its so awkward 😭 they had like 7+ just watching you constantly. The only good thing were the drinks and the bartenders. Not worth it."

I love the decor and displays of famous outfits. Furniture is plush and comfy. This is the perfect place for a night out or as a venue for your own private event in Orange County.; Had such a great time here at Rumba Room Live last Saturday (June 11th) I had to write a review. For having been my first time here, by far it exceeded my expectations. One thing I can say some of the nicest and friendly staff here (Shout out to John the bartender).

Primarily came here to take my friend to his first night club and we gave him a night to remember. The combination of great music (Latin Urban, Reggeaton, and some EDM), the wide dance floor (The photos added were taken near opening), and great bartending service (drinks averaging around $15-$18) helped make it a perfect night. John who was our bartender was funny, a great host, and talker. Can't wait to come back in the near future.

2 suggestions I'd have are the following.
1) Having a Cumbas or Dance night or even having some songs mixs into the music set.
2) I'm not sure when the website has been updated but just some food for thought. Thanks again!; Love to go dancing here. I like the music. They close at 2. We usually Uber there. You can go to dinner first there are lots of spots at the Garden Walk and then you can go burn it off on the dance floor.  💃; Drove an hour to get here for my friends birthday. Took a patty bus to get here just to see they are temporarily closed. Very disappointed. Stuck at the cantina.; It was my first time going to this club and it was great. Everything was going well until I noticed a few guys trying to take advantage of random drunk girls. I actually told 1 guy off and tried helping the girl sober up. I saw him gran her and started making out with her, then started griping her as she was completely out of it. It took a few minutes before the sober friend pulled her away from the guy. She was apparently 21 even though she looked like my 16 year old daughter. I would’ve gave it 5 stars but the lack of security made me very uncomfortable for young girls that don’t know how to handle alcohol yet. That same guy grabbed another young girl by the waist luckily I told the boyfriend and he pulled her away before he could do the same thing. I heard him bragging to his friend that that’s why he likes coming here. My goal was to get buzzed and have fun with my friends but after what I saw I asked for water instead of alcohol and I completely sobered up. This situation left a really bad taste in my mouth and I left home worried about other girls becoming victims. I would suggest more security checking to make sure that doesn’t happen. Lol it made me feel like applying for the sexy security position.😜"

No street parking but you are allowed to park across the street in a parking lot... Even though signs state ""No Parking"" at the entrance gate of the parking lot.  When we called to make reservations, we were told to park across the street. We asked again when we arrived (no cars were parked there) They reiterated to park across the street in the parking lot. I needed to make sure, I did not want to end my evening with a parking ticket or towed.

No cost for parking or entrance into the Speak Easy!

You scan a bar code from your table or go to the bar and order.  They recommend ordering using the bar code for faster service.

They accept cc and if you pay with cash there is a discount.

We paid with cc, easy to scan the bar code, order then pay all in one transaction. I started to leave a cash tip when my friend directed me to look at the  receipt from when I scanned and ordered, the tip was included as well as tax on the tip.
It was confusing because when I was directed to pay using the scan, there was an option to tip, for ex... 18%...20% as well as a tip that was already included plus tax on the included tip. The already included tip was what I was going to tip in cash so no biggie there. Just need to know beforehand.

Drinks were fast and delicious!

The atmosphere was superior! The immersive surroundings, excellent. Yeti was AWESOME! He came around several times, adding something different each time. Stopping to take selfies with everyone. The waitress....Great

Definitely arrive as early as possible to get a table, somewhere to sit.

Drinks only, no food. There is a Taco person outside. Grabbed a delicious burrito afterwards.; I'll start off by saying this is for sure more of a dive bar scene than anything and the area is less that stellar, so safety first when visiting the area. Now onto the better. The DJ was fantastic! The service at the tall tables was friendly and fast. They are a cash only place for the door charge of $15. The parking is across the street in a fairly dark and unsecured lot( free). The place looks like it needs fresh paint, carpet , and a deep clean. The cover band was ok at best. Glad we stopped by as we were in the area for a wedding but would not go out of my way to come here. There are cleaner and larger 80s clubs in neighboring cities.  Lastly, security is very serious here, which is a good thing in my opinion.; Bought out the VIP section, talked to the manager several times about a family gathering and because my brackets fell off when dancing they wouldn't let me out to the parking lot where their food truck is located. The cocktail server was great but the manager and security are horrible! Maybe Corona is better but me and my party of 40 will never return. BOOO to this location!!; Super Fun!  Definitely have to check out ""THE SET""  THEMED SPEAK EASY; This car had great music, a great dj, and excellent service the atmosphere and the people we're so fun. I'm a dance floor and Light it was awesome. I would definitely bring friends and family here again"

Right when I got to the to first club it was like the opening event and club after club it just got better. The clubs were themed and very nice with a ready to dance environment. It was really cool because I got to go in a group so I got to talk and meet with everyone in my group plus the people at the club. It was a terrific first experience thanks to the hosts Melody and Angel! Definitely an experience to try again!; This was my first time in California along with my husband. We were clueless as to where we wanted to go downtown but planned a Hollywood clubbing night now. It was AMAZING! The hosts are sooo friendly and lots of fun! They know how to keep your night entertaining. Prepare for some walking. Not very far. Loved the group atmosphere. This club crawl made you feel VIP. The clubs were also amazing. You spend just enough time at each one and the hosts do a good job at rounding you up to get to the next club. Shout out to our host Angel! He was awesome! Drinks are pricey but hey it's Hollywood. Prepare for $10+ per drink. This club crawl takes care of your cover for each club and gives you reasonable drink specials and there's no wait to get in! Will absolutely do this again!; An awesome way to walk down the Walk of Fame and have a great time! The hosts are incredibly nice and make you feel really welcome. The club selection and music was wonderful! It was a fun time and I met some really cool people! Highly recommend and I will definitely go on the club crawl again.; The Hollywood Pub Crawl wouldn’t have been amazing without the host Alyssa! She is one of the most fun and energizing hosts I’ve come in contact with. She made the entire experience fantastic! I hope she will be hosting more events like these in the future. Rock on Alyssa 🤟🏽!!!; If you are going to nightclubs, you NEED to go with the club crawl!!!!! If you want a more relaxed scene, this is not the event for you. We had a ladies night out and it was a blast. Our host Mike went above and beyond for us. We already are planning our next night out with you guys! Thank you so much for the hospitality, next ladies night we are going to try the Downtown Los Angeles club crawl."

The crowd, the energy, the live karaoke sessions! Drinks are so so. $$$ my friend paid $23 for a drink in a small plastic cup. I don't think it's worth $23.

Entry was $20 even on a guest list. Male or female. My roomie was a regular, so I finally gave it a try.

It was full to me but the roomie said, its usually more crowded. There were a lot of beautiful black woman. I noticed the woman more than the men. 😅

I'd recommend it for a fun Monday night. :); These people made me handicapped. On March 31, 2023 they dropped a couch from stage and fell off the stage trampling people, one of which was me. I haven't received a dime. These people have cost me upwards of 10000 dollars in medical bills.; Horrible bouncers. Tried to charge me $20 at the door. i easily would have spent $1000+ at your bar 😂😂😂😂 good luck staying in business/gaining profits with bouncers that rob their customers. Well go to “ good times at davey waynes instead”; This place has good music and a great vibe! I’m writing this on my third visit; yes, it will cost you to get in and it will cost you to get drinks, but good things don’t come free!

They do open their doors later than the time mentioned on the flyer, but the wait is worth it!

There was some confusion about the tickets I purchased online, but the staff was polite and quick to resolve the issue. We do make minor errors as we are all human, but I have always been treated with respect and that’s what really counts! Would definitely recommend this place.; Went to this venue today and feel like this place is a scam for wanting to charge people entry fees and reservations fees for the tables, and you do need to have rsvp, all for a place that is literally a bar with some dj setup. The photos shown are very deceiving because this place not what you would call a music venue, it is simply a tiny bar with very little space to walk around. There are other bars and restuarants nearby that you can simply walk in to grab some food and drinks and no need to go through all that hassle"

$300 to reserve the table. Only because we were from out of town lol I asked the other tables and they were like no. Just come in and get a section. Anyway paid for $100 for waters and red bull to make $600 tab. 120 added for gratuity a joke. the money isn’t important it’s the simple fact that they said $600 minimum. Ended up being $820. Then $210 for 3 hopkahs which were horffic and they hookah “girl” was like no it’s fine. When it was literally burning everyone’s throat. Sigh lol crowed is ghetto music is mid. Please  go across to riot house.; Came on a Sunday night with my friend. If you are looking for the wow factor, then the $10 cover charge will probably be worth it. Saw Ja Morant and Derrick Rose (NBA). The decor is nice. Sorta emo Victorian. However, I wasn’t a fan of the club as a whole. Girl at the door had an attitude and the bartenders seemed very disengaged. It was busy for a Sunday but there wasn’t a lot of singing along or dancing from the club goers. (Mostly trap/rap music that night). It seemed like some people were there just to flex in their sections or celebrity watch maybe. Especially the men lol. Honestly, as a lady, I felt a little uncomfortable here. Mostly standing room only but that’s to be expected.; I work in scottsdale and bring buyers to Pretty Please. They act like they the hottest club in Old Town when they not. To cut off someone bringing 20 girls and one guy to club is stupid at 1am when every other place lets them in until 140am. I tell my athletes to stay away because they act like they top notch. It’s not about price but about how they treat people. Tried to bring three Knick’s players in and they said no after seeing their IGs lmao; I went on a Sunday night and it was packed. The crowd was wild. And the Dj was great. I would absolutely suggest getting a table for comfort and standing room. However, good luck getting ahold of then because I haven't been able to reach anyone in the past two (2) weeks. Via social media or otherwise. I would go again, but depending on the night and how the crowd is. I would definitely consider a table area. Go see for yourself and enjoy.; This establishment was an overall horrible experience with poor service from the time I stepped in front of the building.

There is absolutely no order in place in regards to gaining access into the entrance of the building. I was standing outside for 2 hours before visibility seeing the main door.

After that I was yelled at by staff to move further back or o wouldn’t be allowed in. There was extremely no where to move and no once was being directed by any “Pretty please representative at the time of the yelling.

Then the entrance fee was extremely expensive and it was not something I want to experience ever again."

Labor day weekend we got there at 6:30pm they were not yet open but website says they open at 4pm. so we stood outside until 7pm. Once we got in we were told that there is no seating all tables and chairs had been reserved. They had roped off all tables and booths, & removed the chairs from all of the bars accept from the bar around the stage, mind you those seats were reserved also. Since we got there early there was hardly any patrons so I sat at the seat at the bar table and every 5 minutes the staff reminded me that that was a-reserved seat and that the party would be arriving around 9pm (2hrs from then). I had already bought 3 drinks while sitting there for me and the guests that I came with so I was a paying customer, but obviously the staff would prefer to only serve the guests that made the reservations because the waitress (brunette Caucasian straight hair half up half down not very attractive young lady) asked me to get up because she didn’t want to continue cleaning the table from me buying more drinks… Cool say no more. In an economy where it is almost a luxury for the working class to come out to enjoy a nice evening its crazy to be treated like your patronage is not welcomed. I will not return nor will I recommend… tiktok video coming soon; Typically, the place is crowded on Sunday nights after 9:00 p.m. for the amazing band, Reminisce. Luckily, I found a table on the second level towards the back. The wait staff located me right away, taking my order. The food and wine were on point, as was the music and overall vibe. Overall, it was a great way to end my birthday week.; We'd been to Blue Martini before, about 7 years ago, pretty late at night, so this review doesn't cover that but the most recent experience when we visited for a Saturday happy hour.  Although it was pretty fun the last time, from what we remember...?  This time, for a more sedate experience, we ordered a discounted app for happy hour, as well as a couple of the signature blue martinis.  The food was good, but the martinis were sublime.  And fun to look at as well!  Needless to say we exceeded the preset limit of one each.  Not to mention our bartender was terrific- friendly, not pushy, and perfectly attentive.  It wasn't super busy, but in our experience this doesn't necessarily affect the level of service, so we appreciated how awesome she was.  All around amazing experience!  We will be back, for happy hour, and who knows what else after a few of those blue martinis!; Colleagues and I commemorated my 40th birthday and engagement celebration. I thoroughly enjoyed dancing and partaking in beverages. While the drinks were of high quality, they were somewhat costly. The server demonstrated exceptional attentiveness. It proved to be an ideal venue for group gatherings, although regrettably, a few of my colleagues were unable to attend. Nevertheless, the event was a resounding success.; My wife and I visited Blue Martini on a Friday evening in August for happy hour and we had a great experience. The happy hour specials were better than most in the Scottsdale area and the atmosphere was high energy and very fun. What really made our experience exceptional was the wonderful service provided by Natalie. She was a superb server, with high energy, a very positive and fun personality, and she was extremely attentive to all her customers. She made the visit so enjoyable that we returned the following Friday evening. And when we're back in Scottsdale we'll definitely continue to frequent the Blue Martini.   B and L."

Even though I wasn't a huge fan of what the DJ was playing it was still a vibe. I really enjoyed how there's a separate outdoor area that's much quieter than the inside, it's super helpful for when the noise becomes a bit much for me to handle. I will definitely be coming here as my primary bar!; Absolutely LOVE this place. I'm a pretty anxious person, but they always make me feel super welcome. Staff is lovely and hilarious, drinks are tasty. Been for a karaoke night and a UHaul singles event, and both times it was lively and I had an absolute blast. If you're looking for a safe environment for any type of person, this is where to go. Chill but not dead when I went from about 7-9, the party really starts picking up 10-12 (I haven't stayed longer than that due to my work hours, but I fully intend to). Bring your cishet friends and they can still have a wonderful time. I not only feel safe on a literal level, with staff I feel I can go to if something is wrong and weapons checked at the door, but mentally safe to put my reservations aside - everyone puts themselves out there and you can be yourself, and there's areas you can go to chill out when it's more packed. Parking is a bit tight if you're bringing a DD but nothing impossible. Seriously cannot recommend enough! Come through!; Lesbian bar. Dancing area and patio. They have a NA beer, and of course sodas. Wish there was an actual mocktail menu but you could ask the bartender to mix something up. Came during the day. Love that they opened at 2pm since we are old ladies that don't stay up late anymore 🤣
Street parking is kind of limited so be prepared to walk a couple blocks. Not bad. Will be back.; In a state that’s hit or miss when it comes to queer safety, Boycott is a true oasis of acceptance and support. Your identity doesn’t matter - if you’re human, you’re welcomed and loved. Very few places can boast of that. Audrey and her bartenders make EVERYONE feel like they belong, and in a world like the one we live in, that matters.; Went for the first time last night and it was good. I think a $10 cover charge when the place is half empty on a Friday is a little expensive; I think they would have a huge turnout if they didn’t charge a cover! I think it would also help with the diversity because there wasn’t a lot of POC; it’s only one kind of LGBTQ+ crowd if you get what I mean. The drinks are great, my girlfriend and I had fun. I would come back on a night that’s free 😊"

It’s my new home.; Great dive bar still going strong is sleazy is your desire this place is a must. A pint and a shot of Johnnie Walker Black for less than $10; Place was absolutely ridiculous I understand it’s a bar and you go to drink but when going with a large group not everyone is gonna be drinking ever heard of a designated driver ?? What kinda place kicks you out for not having a drink if there was a sign saying a minimum amount of drinks per person I’d understand but no warning whatsoever anywhere on top of that how you gonna come up to me and say “yo you gotta split” ever heard of being a decent person and politely asking someone to leave no one was drunk or belligerent so there was no reason to kick us out. Absolute joke of an establishment; Cash only! They do have an ATM inside. The bartenders are nice. The prices are good. This is more of a local hole-in-the-wall dive.; Terrific drinks.

Really awesome experience and will be back. Magical moments!; We went to Cake off a suggestion from an Uber driver. It did not disappoint! Drinks were reasonably priced and the music was great. Worth every penny.; I visited this club for a bachelorette party and I was blown away. I had never been to anything this fancy. It’s a party in here. Staff is attentive, helpful and friendly. I feel like I was a bit older. I’m guessing most of the people in this club was in their 20s and was more their scene. Even tho it wasn’t mine they played good music and the drinks were great. Security is at every corner and made their presence known so that make me feel safe. I love the entertainment this club does for all the parties around the club.; They let way to many people in at one time. If you didn’t pay for a table, expect long waits to order anything and have no room to walk at all. Both drinks and shots were $13 each."

It was a little slow, but I had great service. I’ll be back 😀; Not the best service. Initially took about 15-20 minutes to get beer after we ordered. She hardly came around much. Ordered the Cajun Caesar salad which was a head a Romain, not entirely sure if there was dressing on it but whatever my bad. There were 2 sun dried tomatoes in the salad so that's probably what made it Cajun I guess. All good though I've had my fair share a brutal meals. The waitress couldn't split the meals up because we were a group of 10, which is fine. I don't understand that rule in the states but I'm assuming it's because it'll take the waitress an extra 3 minutes out of her work day standing at the bar. And since we were a group of ten, there was an automatic 22% gratuity added onto the bill. Which she clearly deserved. Plus a 4% venue fee because they're that great. Probably won't be going back.; I stopped in to watch sports while on vacation, not knowing anything about the place.  The food I got wasn't quite what I ordered, but it was excellent regardless.  The bartenders were so gracious and kind that I felt like I was the most important customer in the building.  I have worked in restaurants/bars for over 10 years and understand mistakes happen with food, but Amy and Kae went so far above and beyond to make sure I was ok with it that I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.; Ok Dierks Bentley! I see you!

We stopped at this place on a whim and it literally was the best decision of the day! We got there super early thinking they opened at 4 for happy hour but they open at 5 so beware! We went and took a walk and came back.

We literally were the first ones in the door and they didn't have a bartender yet but the hostess seated us and our waitress Brielle came right away. She helped us make decisions, told us what was on the happy hour menu and recommended drinks too. She told us it might be a minute on the drinks but kept us posted about everything that was going on. She even went to try and get the bartender for us which it wasn't a long wait, maybe 10 minutes.

She brought our drink which was the JIMBO. It was strawberry with a little spritzer, very flavorful and they didn't skimp on alcohol. We ordered the southern fries which were half price for half the size which was perfect for 2 people. The fries were amaaaazing!! You could get them with ranch or bleu cheese but we got ranch! Great combo with the BBQ sauce and ranch!

I ordered the Mac and cheese with blackened chicken. Before I ordered, I asked if it was good and she said yes but I asked if she was just saying that and she said no they use lots of different cheeses, definitely not Kraft and it wasn't!! I really enjoyed it. My husband ordered the burger with garlic sweet potato fries which were out of this world!!!

Brielle was really good about checking on us, refilling our waters without us asking, and checking to see if we needed anything. Great place to watch the game with a huge screen and of course country music! I didn't experience the club or party aspect but would definitely go back for happy hour and the bar scene!"

Keep up the great work guys and thank you all; My brother and I went here last night and had a blast. The bartender (whose name I wish I could remember) was super cool and we chatted with him a bit and then played a few rounds of pool. The drinks weren’t that expensive which was a huge plus since everything in Big Bear is so pricey. I highly recommend this stop if you want a little night time fun!; This is probably one of the best places to go in big bear and get a drink.

The biggest issue I have with this place is the music. They played the same remix of not like us by Kendrick Lamar and another Spanish song. The mix was really bad and did not make me want to dance and it got to the point where I was holding back laughter the second time I went because i couldn’t believe they played the same remix twice. Please!!! Play some good tracks :); I went here this past thursday for the first time, the opener did a phenomenal job! the music did cut out from time to time but the dj was quick to fix the technical issue. Look forwarding to coming back, looking forward to their next set.; My friend and I (both of us are 21) went to go to this club. She paid first and when waiting for me the security guard told her she could wait and said she needed to enter the club. She did. I paid 20 dollars because 21+ gets charged that. Today the next day we were talking about yesterday and she said ""wow 30 dollars was a lot for a cover fee"" that's when I told her I got charged 20. She calls to ask for the difference because she is 21 so she should've been charged 20. The person speaking to her, several times, tried blaming my friend saying she should have noticed the difference immediately when we both paid at the front. But how when she was told to enter the club? Which she explained to the person on the phone. But instead of trying to make things right he insinuated she was lying and that it was not a mistake done by the employee. Basically it's her fault for a mistake someone that works there did 🤷‍♀️.; this security along the others are the absolute worst!! very very rude .
i asked him for his name and he slammed the door right in my face and hit my elbow .; DO NOT GO HERE !! came here last night with 2 of my friends and the security was EXTREMELY rude. they had kicked me out because i held a drink for one of my friends for not even a minute and they kicked me out?? I was not drinking or anything (just simply holding a drink for a friend that was buying a girl a drink). The security approached me very rudely and told me i had to leave. He was YELLING AT ME when i was clearly walking to the exit and he even pushed me. Once I got out of the club we saw the same security and we asked for his name and he responded very rudely and quickly and slammed the door on our faces and even hit my friend with it (even told them to pull up the cameras) Never coming back here. There was 2 securities they were both Big guys with glasses. I had told some other people outside of the club about my experience and they said they had the same problem with the SAME security."

I mentioned it to their manager immediately before the place got packed. It was warm and stuffy at 6pm. He said he was aware of the A/C situation.

Looks like a common thing because several women and even some men had their own hand held fans. I asked them about the A/C and they said it's always hot so they go prepared.
If you want a seat by the dance floor, you have to arrive early. The food is better from the restaurant next door. You have 2 menu options.  The club food is ok if you don't mind nachos and other fried foods. Cocktails were good and service was great!
The only way I will return is if the A/C gets fixed.; Very great atmosphere! They had live music which was awesome and they also had a DJ who was on a roll with a great variety of music selection. Cat the waitress was friendly and attentive. Will definitely return!!; We had a fantastic Friday night, they had a live band and a DJ, there's an entrance fee, requires a minimum of 2 drinks consumption within the first two hrs, cocktails were decent, great ambiance, great service, pretty good vibe, mature audience.; Nice lounge bar and dance floor.

I visited for the first time last night with a group of four friends.

Security harassed my friend from California, threatening to take his ID, which was vertical but valid until 2028. They let us in, we paid the $15 cover charge and entered the venue which only had about five people inside.

After leaving and returning an hour later, we were allowed back in without paying again. Security patted us down, and we went inside. While ordering a drink at the bar, the same security guard from the front door came over, put his hand on me, and escorted me out without explanation. Once we reached the front, he finally said they’d thought they felt something in my pocket and patted me down again. Why let someone in if you’re not sure they have weapon or anything else? Does that sound that safe?

To add, the bartender initially told us that the tickets we received could be redeemed at 12:00 PM for a vodka drink or a beer. When we had returned, he changed his story and said they were for a raffle. Overall frustrating, especially since he had told all four of us the same thing initially.

I would never recommend this place to anyone. The staff were unprofessional and rude.; Great atmosphere, bartender always tentative, music is always good, have wine coolers for people who don’t like beer and top two drinks i recommend is Bye (rum instead of tequila) and pineapple with malibu; It’s a nice place good music bartenders are nice as well, but security guard are worthless. I went outside to get some fresh air and they didn’t even let me in back because supposedly I was too drunk already.
(1:00-> ) so I had a big argument with them talking about the stamp system, and that there is no balcony so I can get fresh air and then go back inside. They need to apply that rule somewhere by the door or something like that, you can back inside you look like 😋 it’s almost got in a fight with the security guard. He look like 5’7 or 5’9 white almost bald, but yah not coming back sadly.; I've only been here once which was recently. I attended the All White theme party which was pretty cool. I liked the grass wall, white couches and big chandeliers but the dance floor was tiny and the bathroom is small/kind of dirty. Overall it was a good time!; This Cash Inn isn’t anything close to the old Cash Inn Country at all. The new place wasn’t crowded like the old place, drinks seem to be water down, to much country music, not a variety of music like the old place. To many guys this isn’t a lesbian bar like the old place. I don’t see this place surviving at all.
It’s ashamed that these owners have no idea.
The old location even though there wasn’t hardly much parking the owners back than knew what worked in the club and the owners were highly respected.
I will not be returning to this Cash Inn this club which in my opinion isn’t a lesbian at all."

We spent at least $650 and we got a vip table plus a bottle but we weren’t allowed to pour our own shots or make our own drinks due to their policy. I feel like we weren’t going to enjoy our time after this, we left this place and left behind untouched liquor/beer.; $35 for 3 shots ? CRAZY!

It was Lowkey boring.; The bandas play great 💯❤
But the customer service 🙄 starting with whoever is charging the cover entrance, very bad attitude. Automatically makes you not want to go in.

I always get the cheesecake because I'm a big fan of cheesecake. I remember it tasting different, it wasnt as good this time. Not as creamy as I remember. I got 3 slices to share, some bread, and a cake roll. Unfortunately the cake roll was rather dry. I want to say it was an off day for them because usually their pastries are very good. They also sell meats and cheeses as well as some groceries. I spent about $5 for everything. Everyone was rather friendly, not as friendly as other places I've visited though. It's one of the few bakeries in town and its right at the entrance so it's quite popular. It still has hurricane damage so the sign is very small, so you have to pay attention when looking for it. Like I said, I'm going to guess it was am off day because the product was not as good as I've had before. The place does have decent food and pastries.; We came from Atlanta, Ga. Our family comes here all the time. They wanted to share with me; Edit: They raised their prices. I think some is to much for what it is, so I don’t think I’ll come again. Also the coffee was awful. If u have a sweet tooth, you'll enjoy their pastries and they make really good calzones.; Today we went on an adventure to Lares, Puerto Rico. Our quest was good chocolate cake. We found that but also found the best vanilla flan and the best chicken quesadillas we have ever had. Edgar, the owner, was extremely personable and interesting. Their homemade bread was fresh and warm. We took it home and had it for dinner. It was definitely worth the drive over from Rincon.; Great price. Good bread 🍞 and delicious cake ."

Good appetizer selection. Good drinks variety. Safe and clean environment. Lively atmosphere. Ample, good-looking space, air conditioned. Attentive service.

Cons: Confusing receipt charges.

My husband paid about $20.00 per drink. His go to drink is a special mix. But this is the first time we pay this much for it. He is very trusting so he pays and walks off but when I revised the receipt at home I noticed the way they charged it was very confusing so I think they just charged it wrong. Also, the bartender that cashed us out was not happy with a 15% tip.

Advice: Check your receipt! Ask questions before you order or pay. Stick to common drinks or beer. Have a good time!

We will probably be back, be mindful of our orders, check our receipt before we go and maybe tip a bit more.; Very clean, positive atmosphere, great service and cold drinks; Excellent place to play billiards, excellent food, the attention of the servers is excellent!; Best complete billiard spot ive been in PR. tables are great!; Great food 😋 clean and safe investment grat for family-friendly hang out"

A lot of bars a few eateries/ restaurants. The food was great! We went to a little place, can’t remember the name, just that they had a statue in the corner with a man with 2 left arms smoking and a kid in a weird position. But the red snapper tasted wonderful.  I watched videos online about this place but didn’t get the same vibe when present.  I guess everyone working was on vacation in another location.; This place felt like I time traveled back to the Lamba Chi Alpha house at USC ahahahaa. Lawless and godless.
I had a front row seat to witness a couple guys from our hostel who were on a mission to meet some Puerto Rican mamacitas. I stood in the corner because I’m really shy and introverted and I’m okay with that 🙈
They returned from Tulum bruised and battered 2 nights in a row when they were showed not an ounce of love by the mamacitas. A bitter pill to swallow indeed. But fairplay to them as they are the ones actually in the arena, faces marred by dust and sweat and blood.
Overall this is the crown jewel of La Placita.; Bartenders charge you whatever they want. I was charged three different prices for the same drink: a rhum and coke (house rhum, big one), and the highest was $17 before tips, it feels like they’re just taking advantage of you when you’re a tourist.; Tons of bars in the area that are literally  walking distance. Drinks were decently  priced more hip hop vibes . Loved it !!; My wife ordered a mixed drink with Don Julio and it was adulterated, very dangerous practice and completely illegal. Thankfully we only took one sip and threw it out. If you do go stick to beer."

Very disappointed at the last minute cancellation.; This was my first time coming to Puerto Rico and this place was recommended to us by a friend living in Rincón. The apartments are stunning and the pool area is nice. However, for anyone reading this it’s very important for you to know that they have a lot of rules, which can definitely come across as overwhelming, we were constantly worried about not breaking them and not having 200 taken from us, which took away from the relaxation. Secondly, the owners live there, I personally do not like staying at the same place as the owners as it feels as if we’re  being monitored, so just a heads up for anyone that might have an issue with this!

Room was Spacious and clean. Bed was comfortable, pool is small but it was low season, so I mostly used it by myself. Everyone is so nice. Really nice, family oriented place. Loved it; Little beetles in our room the first day and in the room we were going to be relocated to, stains and debris on sheets after room service. Owner is nice I’m grateful he showed us around and where to go very knowledgeable. Security guards are nice. Hotel was empty and pool area was rusty and dirty. Overall uncomfortable experience would not recommend regretted it right away; Amazing experience overall!! Travis and Angel were super helpful. Travis upgraded our room and helped fill air in our tire. Everyone was super helpful and the food was also very yummy. Recommend!!; Our family of six stayed at this fantastic little resort right off the beach in Rincon. We had a whole 2-story house they rent to large groups. The accommodations were perfect, even overly spacious for our group size. There is a fully stocked kitchen and private pool just for the house. Travis and his team were welcoming and we found out they run a surf school as well, so the kids took a lesson from Uoco and Este. They were awesome! All the kids were able to surf on their first day. Also on site is the Big Kahuna Bar. Such a fun place. All the best music from the 90s and then some local stuff as well. Big drinks, good tacos and burgers, and live music on Friday nights (although we missed it unfortunately) Anyway, great place. Highly recommend.; Nice hotel with clean and confortable rooms. Although not on the beach, it's only a few minutes walk away.  Only complain was the hot water on the shower, regardless of how long waited to warm up it didn't."

Loved my say at Rincon Ocean Club. It's about a 5 min drive or 20 walk to downtown central area. Tons of restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores nearby.. 5 min walk to the beach which was never busy. Very Central to everything.; It’s all about the beach and the sunsets. They are both amazing!  The unit was modern, super clean and tastefully decorated.  The convenience and proximity to everything was such a bonus.  Truly a paradise.; Administration sucks. I own a unit here. It was impacted by Hurricane Maria. Ever since then it has been unusable. HOA has not taken any affirmative steps to make my unit (or the others in same state or worse) usable.
There's no beach. Building looks horrible. And the only unit being used are the ones whose owners are on the board of directors. Yet, despite my repeated demands and complaints to have my unit back to a usable state... it has fallen on deaf ears, but they continue to charge the monthly maintenance fee.; We own one unit @ the condo; Umforgetable l sunsets , waking distance to the beach & warm yet crashing  tides  & also close by stores & restaurants.  Friendly & helpful locals.  Definetly recommend.

Knowing my uncle who is the owner of the place he is a very nice guy and during open hours of his bar he has nice talks to some people who visit. Pretty solid events too and it’s history of it is pretty cool since the bar used to be a station for the only traveling train in puerto rico thous being called “la estacion” (means station in spanish). One time someone from the American Pickers cast came over to visit and it was pretty awesome. As this being a bar alone if it did not have events or history its still pretty good to go for a better mood. Would recommend visiting when given a chance."

Feels like a fancy bar or normal bar but you still get the Caribbean vibe of our Island 🏝️ and Aguadilla.; Stopped by Tuesday around 7:30. Closed. Google maps said open 3 to 11:30. I'm beginning to realize it's a good idea to call first before making the trip for most places that aren't big chain stores and restaurants around here.; Place is nice - Air conditioning, good cigar selection and good drinks. However, I have never been more mistreated in customer service in my life. Bartender was making faces, and hurrying us up in the cigar room and to order. Very uncomfortable experience. The place was completely empty by the way. Will never visit again...; This venue is the perfect spot to bring friends for a laid-back, enjoyable evening. The staff couldn’t be more friendly, always ready to make your experience special. The drink menu is impressive, with options that cater to all tastes, and if you’re a cigar aficionado, you’re in for a treat—their selection is top-notch. Overall, it’s a great environment for catching up, celebrating, or just winding down with friends over some quality drinks and cigars. Highly recommended!; Arrived as they were opening, the bartender was not friendly at all. You cant smoke inside and once you sit outside they dont even give you an ashtray, chairs were dirt and wobbly. This place may better during peak hours from what I have heard but unfortunately it was not my experience

Update: Service got better, definitely go at least an hour after their opening time to ensure they are properly set."

Then we had a pizza with Feta, Prosciutto, Caramelized Onions and. Balsamic Reducion Drizzle on a crispy thin crust that was delicious. We ordered side salads not on the menu that are normally served as part of the pasta dishes and our friendly and inventive server figured out how to add to our order using a different charge.

We sat on out on the creatively decorated covered patio with antique chandeliers, very effective ventilating fans and reallly cool ambient music.

I could honestly say this is one if not the most modern spots in the area with an amazing view.
Food was amazing, drinks were incredible and most importantly the service was a 10/10. Thank you Lorenzo and his staff for making my visit an unforgettable experience. I definitely would recommend this place for foreigners and locals.; The host was very polite and attentive. Food was excellent.; I recently went to Aguadilla with my sister, from NYC. I could honestly said that Manta Beach Bar is one of the best places in the area. We had the opportunity to have dinner ( empanadas, churrasco y arroz mamposteao; delicious!) and we stay after for a few drinks ( the are very creative with the presentation of them, especially the ""pipi"" shot's lol). Manta not only has a great vibe, but is also located in the downtown of aguadilla, a place that you can feel safe when you are away from home.  If you have the chance to visit this place I would suggest you to do it.; Possibly the worst bar in all of Aguadilla. The employees don't know their cocktails (I swear both mines and my friend's drinks tasted terrible). Plus they make up expensive prices on the spot. If I could give this a negative out of 5 I would.; If I could give this place a 100/100 I would :). I had the opportunity to spend a Sunday evening with my daughters at Manta Beach Bar and we fell in love. The view from this place is out of this world, music was great, food was delicious and the portions were sustainable. The employees were friendly and made sure were having a great time. This was our first time in Puerto Rico, we were visiting from Colombia and I would say this was one of the highlights of our trip to the west.
THANK YOU MANTA for everything !!!"

Cons: 10 to get in was not the problem, the problem came from when I get to the bar and paid 10 dollars for a shot the was in a rinse cup and I wasn’t given my change from a 20 Then I ask for a beer (medallia ) which cost 1 dollar every where else on the island and was told $10. I say I spent less than 5 minutes total no exaggeration in the club. I didn’t even take the chance at looking at the women I’m sure they are pretty like all women in PR. But what can I expect, I am none Spanish speaking so try to take advantage; The girl's are beautiful but there's no entertainment unless you want a private dance.  Wish there was a sexier atmosphere.

The course has magnificent views and is well maintained. Staff are equally as awesome. The cherry on top was the wild tropical birds we saw while playing! 5 stars; For context, I'm a 16 handicap who golfs every other week at a nice public course on the east coast.  My wife is Puerto Rican and we vacation in Isabela every year.  You have to think about this course from a local perspective.  Conditions on the island are rough, from both weather and economy perspectives.  This is a public course in Puerto Rico.  It is not sustainable to keep a public course in pristine condition that only costs $25 to walk.  A few of the greens are in rough shape.  The fairways are not exactly carpet.  But the course is very playable, and the staff works hard to keep it that way.  Today I had a great time golfing here. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  The views along the coast are gorgeous.  The horses and iguanas and the odd item you didn't expect to see is just Puerto Rico and is part of the charm.  I don't know where else in the world you can golf on such a beautiful course right on the ocean for such a reasonable price. If you are expecting a U.S. private club-like experience, then you would be better off paying $250 a round to golf somewhere else on the island.; I love this lay out, buts its a bit beatup right now, the views are beutiful and when the wind blows its a very tough course, the only thing I didn't like was a 2 some in front of me I was walking and they were in a cart and I was on there tails the entire 9, they didn't have the decency to let me play threw.; Some of the best views golfing in Puerto Rico. There could be potholes on the greens and you'll still enjoy your round!; Played this course many times. Played it at times when you could barely call it a golf course and still enjoyed it! The staff is PROUD of this course and it's history and they try the best they can to keep it as good as they can with the money that they have... beautiful views!"

Definitely, Coco will be back!; We walked in without an appointment needing help with a dog we were rescuing. He needed a bath,  badly, as we were leaving the next morning back to the states.  Even though they were fully booked for the day,  they took in Tuco and did a fabulous job!! Thank you so much for your services! You all were so nice and accommodating for our situation!! Thank you again! The passion for what you do truly shines!!; I just moved back to the island and was looking for a place to take my 5 year old sheepadoodle,  Cora. I needed a place that could work with a dog that had previously been abused by a groomer. When we made the appointment I was very up front with my concerns and explained that though I've worked very hard for years to help Cora get past her fears and anxiety,  I was afraid that a new experience would be triggering and all our progress would go out the window. Gabby immediately assured me they would do everything they could to help, and explained they have experience working with difficult cases. She then went above and beyond by calling back to suggest we change the appointment to a day that the business is closed so there would be no rush or the stress of other people, dogs and noise.  Wow. Today was our appointment. She got the haircut exactly how I wanted on the first try, and most importantly, made sure that Cora felt at ease with her, taking the time to show her around and bond with her before getting to work. I am so grateful to have found this wonderful business that are experts in their craft and truly care about the animals they care for.  We found our groomer, for sure.  🧡"

Place is nice but our room's A/C was not cooling, it was blocked off at 72 and in order to lower it the maintenance person has to come by and lower it, once lowered it can't be touched. Even at 65 we barely felt the difference. The beds are full size, luckly we had a twin airbed, because my 2 sons could not fit on one bed. The rooms only have 2 beds for 4 people. There is an ice bucket in the room, you need to pay 50 cents for that small bucket. Your not allowed to bring coolers to the site. The service is good, certain items on the menu are better than others, and the portions of some, mostly breakfast, are small. The location is ok but the beach other than to enter the water has nothing to offer. The pool is very nice and warm, its location is perfect, having the restaurant right next to it. They have pool tables that you have to pay to use. And what really bothered me was at the service desk they have a sign with the wifi name and password, when I was in my room, I could not find the wifi name, my son went to verify, and they told him wifi was only for the lobby and pool area, not for the rooms. These details made a great vacation into an average one.; Excellent weekend escape. No luxurious but it has all of what you need. They have and offer with all meals included but some web sites have other offers with only breakfast for less. The restaurant have a kind of basic menu but enough choices to satisfy anyone, good prices.; Great casual local vibe  place.  Very friendly staff.  Reasonable food...nothing fancy or specifically Puerto Rican.  But  if you want a nice-ish beach, great pool and  a  very relaxed place to stay this  is  it.  It has a very local vibe.....no Spas, no mainland attitude, and  no frills.  Clean rooms, decent  food on site ( but local options  around), great pool and fantastic staff.   I would  stay here again anytime  in the future.; One of the most beautiful places. It was in such a quiet and safe neighborhood. Local traditional restaurants were across the street as well as a convenience store. It felt like living in the community without the fast pace city and fancy hotels. Waves were a bit high though with boogie boards (from Walmart) my kids were out there for hours. Within a short distance is Carbilana Adventures. We rented ATV’s and Four wheelers. Our tour guard was well knowledgeable about the Rain Forest. We stopped for pic oops with amazing views, went swimming in a natural water spring and learned about various trees/plants. A restaurant/bar was on the premises which may it great place to chill with a frozen piinacolda or ice cold beer.  Back at at the resort I truly was blown away by the hospitality of staff especially Stebasion and the management. It was a great place to wind down without the hustle and bustle of being around other tourists. May not be for everyone but staying here allowed me and my family to just enough being with one another. ❤️🌴🍍; Great place! It’s a small but friendly city. It’s a good place to relax and share with friends or family not a lit to do around but beautiful landscapes"

The bright side of the breakfast is that hands down they have the best oatmeal in town.; Horrible. The person who is apparently in charge, Carmen Ramos, was nasty and disrespectful. Ruined my whole experience and I don't think I will host events there ever again. She has no business working in customer service. And I am certain that this can't be the only bad review because of her. Her aberrant demeanor overshadowed the rest of the staff. Again; horrible.; Best Golf Club in PR and probably in all of the USA. The Club is high class, amenities are the best I ever seen, the green is to perfection, the view is like being in heaven.

This venue is merely a large tent set up inside a shopping center’s parking lot. That’s it. The sound is TERRIBLE unless you’re listening to electronic music. The heat is almost unbearable. If you pay for general entrance, be prepared to use a portable restroom with NO running water to wash your hands upon exiting (their “sinks” didn’t work despite ferociously pumping them with our feet). Their VIP bathroom was overflowing and the guests then had to turn to the general portable toilets to relieve themselves.

Also, this venue is divided several sections (some are very small, so beware of that). It was taking some guests longer to order a beer in the VIP bar compared to the general admission bar.

If this place has any intention of being permanent, here’s what I would recommend:
1. Improve the sound system.
2. Install proper bathrooms and sinks.
3. Install some ceiling fan underneath the large tent, to help with the ventilation.
4. Set up some ice-filled stands selling beer throughout the venue- a lot of people wanted to order a beer but had to stand in line half an hour behind guests ordering an array of mixed drinks. This makes the lines longer when you can have a simple beer stand that’ll solve that problem.
5. Create outside pathways that connect to the bars, so that your employees can transport ice and merchandise. It was very annoying (and can end up injuring someone) to have a supermarket carts full of stuff ramming between the crowds trying to get the ice/supplies to the bar. Incredibly, the carts were running through the crowds every ten minutes. There’s gotta be a better way to do this! 🤦🏼‍♀️

As a born and raised local, I’ll terribly miss venues like Vivo Beach Club because this simply isn’t it. It can keep its Dorado residents as customers, but we won’t be making the drive to this place again. Best of luck.; Great venue! Sound quality is amazing (brand new equipment) and lasers are super fun. I'd recommend bring earplugs tho...it's much louder than a lot of other venues I go to for edm.; New spot in Dorado, just opened. Opening night was an epic edm DJ show with Fisher. Great vibe. Great energy. Needed a place like this in Dorado. Has an indoor/ outdoor construct. Serves food and alcohol. Weird setup/ layout for VIP area and for the VIP Tables w/ bottle service- making it difficult to see lasers/ light show, is away from the speakers/bass, and a little challenging to be able to view the DJ. Also a little crowded in those areas due to allowing vip ticket holders to enter the bottle service areas. Feel like those issues are easy fixes and easily addressed. But overall, AMAZING to have a venue like this in Dorado, the concept itself is excellent. Opening night was incredible. A++; What can I say. I went to see Fisher and had the time of my life. The vibe was electrifying and friendly, strong drinks as well. Can't wait to go back!; Went for an event, Great place"

People drink by the pool and are loud. No one pays attention to it and the hotel regulations say otherwise. If you are with children I do not recommend. There one restaurant with eight tables is definitely not enough for this big resort. I waited for a chair for an hour and no one was interested in me waiting. Here the rule is whoever is faster is better. I will definitely not recommend this place to my friends and I will not come back here myself.; I've stood here in the past so I believe this is my 10th stay. The staff is excellent and very polite. There is a nice restaurant on the premise which is private not part of resort. A nice menu variety with reasonable prices.

The only draw back was a power outage on last night but this was not the resort
fault. There are occasional power outages throughout the Island. This resort has a generator but only to power reception desk. They are working on getting generators to power whole resort.; My boyfriend and I stayed here for 5 days. The resort was beautiful as well as the beach. Drinks were yummy. The food was 5/10 for me. Not the best, I’d suggest driving elsewhere for food.

Our room was gorgeous and spotless! When you first drive into the resort, the hotel looks worn down but the inside will amaze you. Definitely going back with our kids next time.

The views are amazing when you’re on the top floors. We were on floor #6. We even saw horses wandering around at night. Beautiful stay.; This place is great!  Great pool, clean rooms, nice 🏖️ beach. Maybe I am little but spoiled of traveling but it would be great if the hotel had someone at the front door to welcome you when you arrive and help with your language. This is little extra service would make the entire experience top notch. Also the restaurant is nice and convenient serving local favorites and good drinks.; We stayed there for a couple nights on last minute notice, The hotel staff was exceptional some of the best I have ever seen. Sorry I am forgetful with names but the pool security guard who worked the night on the 10/8 and both the male Bartender's who worked the evenings on the 10/8 and 10/9 went all above and beyond expected of them in terms of customer service."

There is also a playground for little kids and some fun slides into the pool. There are also basketball courts.

It's similar to other hiltons I've stayed at on the island. The location I don't feel is ideal as it's pretty far off the highway. I'd prefer to stay in San Juan. They have a nice happy hour where they offer free drinks and snacks. Pool was pretty big and cool looking. Not much of a beach.; A bunch of hidden fees. Be prepared to pay a lot more than expected once arriving. For example a $155 resort fee $200 deposit $14 a day to park and a bunch of other fees. Food is expensive so bring your own. Your better off going to an all inclusive. Room was muggy and hot. The AC was broken. I called down multiple time requesting someone looks at it. Someone came up once and left and never came back. We had to sleep with our neck fans. We made the best of our 5 day stay but I don’t not recommend.; Really liked staying here, but the hotel needs a MAJOR update. You can smell that it's old if that makes any sense. The rooms are so out of date, bathrooms need to be redone, & carpets need replacing as well. The view is amazing, though. I loved being able to walk right to the beach. Staff overall were super friendly 10/10.; We had a great time at this hotel. The staff  was  very friendly and very accommodating to our needs.
Breakfast every day was excellent and very delicious. We highly recommend this hotel.; The scenery and view was great! My kids enjoyed the pool mainly, wish they had more kid friendly activities but I guess that would be asking for too much. I wouldn't mind staying at this hotel again. I didn't expect much for the rooms for the most part, in the end, had a good stay and nobody complained about much."

Javier has great hands and he delivered a much needed deep tissue massage. Lucy gave my husband one of the best massages he has ever had! I like the foot scrub before the massage too. Nice touch. I wanted to give Botánico five stars but there were some issues. It’s hard to find. Waze guided us to the wrong entrance. We were able to find the correct entrance and there were few signs guide us to the spa. The signs were also very small. Once we were in the vicinity, it was unclear where to park. We asked a guard who told us where to park and said to come back to him and he would direct us. He directed us to a ballroom, not the spa! Despite the detour we arrived. The spa has a beautiful entrance with a gigantic ancestral-looking tree shading the stairway and entrance. The staff was gracious and served a yummy herbal iced tea while we waited to be taken to our massage room. The showers, relaxation room and locker room have everything you could need. The biggest fail, however,  is the lack of people when you need them. It’s difficult to find staff if you want something or have an issue. When the cool dip pool step broke when I stepped on it, there was no one around to tell. Luckily, I was holding on to the rail otherwise I would have fallen and hit my head on a rock like surface! The staff person I told asked if I was okay and I told her I was, however, no management came to check on me. I will have a bruise on my foot from the impact but overall I am okay. The service people we interacted with were great, however, for a large resort it’s staffed as if it’s a small resort. The food took an hour and 15 minutes to arrive. We were told 45-60 minutes. If we go again, we will know how to get there and what to expect. I think we had high expectations because it is the Ritz Carlton but the overall experience was mediocre at best, unsafe at worst.; The Ritz is the ritz. Here’s my opinion:

- You can’t beat the ritz. It’s a 10/10 every time you go
- Service is always top notch
- amenities are always great quality and plentiful
- The property is beautiful

Here are my considerations, for folks who frequent Marriott properties:

For context, during my 3 night stay in Puerto Rico, I did one night at the Marriott Casino, one night at the St Regis, and our last night at the Ritz Reserve.

By and large, if I came again, I’d probably lean towards the St. Regis. As the name suggests, the service / hospitality / amenities / etc. are 12/10, which should come as no surprise.

Where it edges out over the reserve, is that if you have status with Marriott (we have Ambassador), you get a better bang for your buck with the St Regis in the way of upgrades

The ritz reserve being somewhat of a hot commodity, it’s a little more difficult to flex or get any recognition for your status (given they are 1 of 7)

Here’s my advice:
If you’ve never spent the night at the ritz reserve, do it. It’s worth the experience for certain. But don’t sleep on the St. Regis either

Both have exceptional resorts that are perfect for relaxation.; Visit this spa everything I'm in PR. It is worth the drive and worth the prices. The facilities are outstanding, staff are discreet and professional and the service providers are excellent. Body treatment, facial, you really can't go wrong. Attaching a pic of the reflecting pool in the public part of the spa.; I don’t have the vocabulary to describe our exceptional experience at this spa. I am back home now googling for a comparable spa for our next vacation because we can’t keep coming back to Dorado beach from Canada for the Spa right? Not that the resort wasn’t great but we would like to try different destinations. Anyway about the Spa, from the massive tree before the entrance through to the open relaxation area, then the private male or female area with pool, cold plunge, sauna, indoor relaxation area & dressing rooms to the private oasis were we experienced our couples tamarind bodyscrub and massage….everything felt like a world class experience. I’ll never see a spa the same way again!
Tips:
If you have a service booked get there an hour early then plan to stay later. I should have planned to spend about 4 hours total but we had other thing booked which we almost canceled.
You don’t need to have a service booked to use the spa, you can pay to enjoy the facility.; An experience like no other! Yes I have been to beautiful luxury spas but nothing like this. I love how you are completely immersed in the outdoors. Very grounding, beautiful experience. I will probably go back to Puerto Rico just to visit this spa."

Ample field with many stages to train. So far this is the only place were you can take various training methods. Ranging from simple firearm handling and movement to more advanced scenarios such as night time shooting. The trainer, Rolando makes his priority to ensure that you perform the necessary tasks, regardless of expertise and feel safe while executing them. His assistants are also very kind, full of knowledge and willing to help. Range is always clean and well kept. Basically, the perfect place!; A shooting range with everything you need for practice very clean and organized ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️; I have taken several trainings with these instructors and each time they are more excellent, more professional and more informative.  As I said in other comments...you are tired of the normal shooting range, shooting at static cards and you are looking for something different; contact them.  They are true professionals, always with security present at all times and you learn in ""real life"". They are something very different from what you see out there and best of all they are accessible at all times since the field is located in the Arecibo area...which is close to people with weapons in the nearby towns.  Come train with real situations and with real professionals; They won't regret it.

Grateful for the knowledge they give me in each training...

Mr. August; I have taken courses with my 12-year-old son with RP Security & NRA Firearms and they are excellent. Instructor Rolando is a professional and dedicated to what he does. It instructs you correctly how to use a firearm and how to use it in different situations and scenarios that you could face in real life.💯💯💯💪💪💪👍👍👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐; Thank you for the experience where I learned many things that I did not know about firearms and I hope to have more when I continue taking the classes and practices with you, thank you DLB

All the food was amazing and the carrot cake was 10/10.; One of the best services, atmosphere, quality of food we’ve ever had. Hidden gem in Arecibo. We were lucky to have Gaby or Gabriel as our server. Beyond expectations. Sweet, smart, impeccable service.

We had the omelette with vegetables and potatoes and revoltillo with vegetables and bagette. (I didn’t take pics of that)  Latte with oatmeal was superb.

Thanks so much for providing such an excellent experience."

Nice pool, plus they have a kids pool
Have a pizza restaurant in the hotel.
Plenty of parking spots
Ice machine
Breakfast include
Beautiful lobby
Laundry room..Washer and dryers
Relaxing seat to have a peaceful moments
Front desk clerks super nice
Safe to travel solo.; Things I wish people would outline straight up so here it is:

Our deluxe two queen bed room did not have a coffee maker and microwave.

The main lobby had the microwave and coffee vending machine. Coffee is NOT complimentary as it cost $2. Free tea but no water in the kettle.

NO ELEVATORS and all the rooms are on the second floor so be mindful of your baggage. Steep stairs so be careful on the way up.

Shower: no door. So place the towels so the water doesn’t get out.

Some good channel options on the TV

Good working AC

Vanity/hand sink has no counter space room to place anything so limit items in top of the sink.

Free parking but limited at the front of the building but they have parking in the back.

No gym of course.

Location is convenient. A pharmacy right across the street pretty much.

Breakfast is next door at the Marcos pizza building which you can access through the inside of the main lobby.

One outlet in the entire room hiding behind the night stand between both beds.

Bed sheets: pretty old and stained and who knows. I just hope they are clean. It’s the mattress a bed sheet, another bed sheet to cover yourself with so there are not too many layers.

Pillows stained as well. Just one pillow cover and again feels naked.

They do provide a small conditioner, shampoo and lotion and hand soap.

Four large towels, one for the floor, two small hand towels and two pool towels.

Two rolls of toilet paper and two small trash cans.

Of course NO key fob. Plain normal door key.

They provided us with three pillows for each bed and one “comforter”.; I rented the villa for a five day stay to spend some time with my mother for her birthday. The staff was very polite and welcoming the entire place was clean it may not be modern but that’s not what we came for. I loved the villa and the friendly staff (I’m from New York City so you know morning and afternoon greetings are not common to me) overall everything was perfect I will definitely come again this place is very nice .; People being harsh on the place need to set their expectations realistically. This isn't a high end Hyatt or Marriott property. This is a private owned local hotel that is better than many cheap hotels in the states.

Really enjoyed my work stay for 2 nights while in town for a work seminar. Staff was super helpful and friendly overall, and I actually enjoyed my recently updated Ground floor room.

Not all rooms have outside windows, and mine didn't, however it was QUIET, had plenty of space, great modern furnishings, and ice cold AC.

Looking forward to my next trip. For those concerned,  ask for an updated room and for ground floor to take advantage of the cooling advantages!; Needed a hotel that accepts dogs...they were perfect! Rooms were clean, shower was amazing and the dogs were happy with the king size bed"

But at least a sign that informs the customer and does not have to waste time for 20 or 30 minutes in a store that is honestly not worth wasting that kind of time.

From the moment you walk in, the energy is electric, and the atmosphere is top-notch. The service is exceptional—the staff is friendly, attentive, and always making sure you have a great time. We booked a table, and I have to say, it was one of the most comfortable setups I’ve experienced in a club. The seating was spacious, and the perfect height to enjoy the music and vibe without feeling cramped. Whether you’re dancing or just chilling with your friends, the setup makes the whole experience even better. Can’t wait to come back!; Club Brava is definitely a place where you want to dress to impress. While it’s okay to go for a more casual look, just be aware that they don’t allow shorts or flip-flops—luckily, I checked their website ahead of time, so I knew what to expect. The locals really bring their A-game when it comes to style, and the vibe of the club reflects that. I had a nice time, and it was great knowing I was dressed appropriately for the occasion. Make sure to check the dress code before you go so you can enjoy the night without any surprises!; I had a fun time at Club Brava, especially with their VIP service. The staff was super attentive, and the experience felt really special. One tip, though—make sure to talk to the VIP managers beforehand to confirm that the area you’re getting has enough space for your group. It can get crowded, so you’ll want to ensure everyone’s comfortable. Overall, the night was fantastic, and I’ll definitely be coming back for more VIP nights!; I hit up 3 clubs while in Puerto Rico, and Club Brava was hands down the best. The vibes were unmatched, and it wasn’t super expensive either. The whole experience was amazing—definitely coming back!; this is probably one of my favorite places to visit in PR for dancing and being around Boricuas... they know how to party! very important, do your diligence in researching their rules of dress code and what days are best for us 21+ people. I went friday and saturday and had a blast... thursdays are for younger crowds 18+ every day is a different vibe. I love reggaeton so saturday was everything :). I called and asked the vip managers for all the info i needed and they were very helpful in making sure I got exactly what i was looking for in my experience.

Guess what! They did not had fries and wanted me to go to customer service made the long line. So I asked for a different item of equal value since it was not worth make the line at customer service, and had cold food on my return to the table.

The lady at the cafe had an attitude and said she could not do that and call a manager. After explaining what we wanted we did not needed the money back, we could have had a soda or something equal value they said NO and wanted me to do a line.

Customer service provided by the manager and employee was deficient and not to the standard of care as other Sam's in USA main land.

There needs to be options if I purchase something and is not available it should said so in the app. They are not doing the job properly and are managing customer care poorly.

I do not recommend this store and won't be shopping here never again.

This would not had happened in USA or Costco!; Temperatures are checked on the way in. Shelves are stocked but the crazy check out lines were a problem. Lines passed the isles into the clothing section. Not enough cashiers open and the flow was not efficient. We spent nearly an hour in the store most of which was waiting in line...to buy water... that's it. Oh then you have to wait in a line to check out pass security to exit as they rescan pretty much everything again and verify it against your receipt. I understand they're controlling theft but there has to be a more efficient. Maybe more than two people can do the job at the same time."

-Cubano
-Breakfast sandwich
-Montecristo
-Bori Ham Grilled Cheese
-Cappuccino
-Latte

Everything was amazing! The mallorca bread was so soft and the sourdough was on point.
They have tables on the side if you want to eat there.; Do not miss this unassuming food trailer on the side of PR-2 in Hatillo. Their amazing artisan bread and baked goods are freshly made with love each day. Excellent coffee. Large portion sizes for the price. I suggest trying the Bori ham and grilled cheese, the breakfast sandwich and make sure you go early so you can grab one (or, in my case-two) of their giant chocolate chip cookies-they are legendary.; Super yummy, small batch baked goods! Their bread is the best tasting artisan bread I've ever had. And their prices are great (specially if you compare them to similar shops in the metropolitan area); Delicious food, bread, and danish.

Only thing is that we didn’t ask for the receipt and the wifi password was there, unfortunately they didn’t gave me a code so I just had to buy something else.

But great location, clean bathrooms and friendly staff; The store is almost always full. The beverages are a bit expensive. Flavor wise I got the strawberry and cream Frappuccino and it wasn’t that good. It’s mostly full of teens very popular so far and it has a drive through. It could use some cleaning but it was decent.; I had to ask more than once in Spainish and Engrish for an inch of cream gesturing with my fingers and a dollar in the tip jar. The fact cream is simular is several languages is confusing to me. Was charged full price for a refill' spent over $10 for one coffee, refill, and a everything bagel with cream cheese.; Friendly service. Clean store.; Drive-thru: Terrible service. This girl should not be attending customers. I went through at 2:15 pm, at the window all I ask was if she can include one more panini. She was quick to respond that she is not suppose to do it but she will do it only because there's not many customers.

The security guy at the entrance was not only rude but also discriminatory towards gay individuals. Despite having a valid ticket for the event, I was denied entry without any valid reason. The staff were unprofessional and seemed indifferent to customer satisfaction. Discrimination has no place in any establishment, and I would strongly advise against supporting this nightclub.; Do not waste your money! They make you buy a ticket, but I’m not sure what for? There were maybe 3 people here…it’s simply not worth it. Also, the security and check-in staff are very rude.

Everyone is always so atentive and helpful. Especially the young lady that helped me today, Kinaisha. She is always extremely helpful, Knowledgeable and kind. I do have one complaint strictly for the owners: you are selling medicine to people with conditions, not candy. Stop changing the products you bring. There is one particular vape that really helps with my pain and sometimes you bring it regularly, sometimes they disappear for months. This translates to me screaming from extreme body pain due to not having the one thing that really helps me completely. Please be more compassionate with your clients and understand we depend on your decisions. Please BE MORE CONSISTENT WITH YOUR PRODUCTS!!!; Friendly staff. Open on Sundays. Many edibles. Could definetly have a better flower display and selection; The quality of their flowers is very bad. 👎 More leaf than flower. Moldy smell on all the 5 strains I purchased. Horrible trim job. You can definitely tell they send the lowest quality product they purchase to this store. Location is very nice and cozy. Same selection as their other stores. That's about it. I would never come back to this location even in an emergency.

This is truly a great place to eat healthy with great flavor!
Never before, eating healthy was so tasty!!! They serve a variety of healthy choices from ""shakes"", Waffles, ""Bolydonuts"" (this is so incredible as it is difficult for me to describe how great it is!!!), The curious thing is, even there are many Herbal Life franchise stores, each of them has their own touch. For example, this store, has what I call the small Nutribowl size, which is great for those like my girlfriend who doesn't need More than 24 onces to eat. Also, it's sooo good!!! Theirs is very thick!!
Living and eating healthy has never been so tasty! Practically my daily dinner is a Nutri Bowl in the afternoons. They have more than 30 flavors and I think I've tried them all. Take advantage of the seasonal flavor: Pumpkin Flavor with Cinnamon.
They will remember me.
All of these Herbal Life stores have great quality and flavor. However, each of them is distinguished by the special touch of those who prepare the products, drinks and meals. They have Waffles, bolydonuts, smoothies, Nutribowls, Mega tea, detox, among others.

In this particular store, the Nutribowl stands out. It is the location with the smallest Nutribowl version (approximately 24 ounces); which is perfect for those who are satisfied with less quantity. It is very thick and tasty."

I’m not sure how the club operates normally or what the usual vibe is like, but the private event truly elevated the experience.; This was my first time here. We were celebrating my birthday. The DJ was great. The music was great. The customer service was good. The dance floor is small. We danced the night away. I recommend this nightclub.; Bartenders and the promoters are cool. DJ is good some nights when they know how to mix and not replay songs. Don’t celebrate your birthday or any event here. Club is mostly empty.  If you’re in your 20s don’t come here. Mostly older people in their late 30s and 40s. Barely anybody reserves tables bc it’s so empty. Around 12 the dance floor will be packed but nobody in sections. Which is weird only like some girls who get promoter sections. Party somewhere else seriously. It’s not worth it otherwise.

I have a BIG problem with security. They are liars and incompetent. You’ve been warned. Good luck partying here; I recently stayed at Aria and everyone at hotel told me to go check out the night club. So me and my friend but we were treated so bad by this woman who was a security person, she called us
Thieves because of a piece of paper someone offered us that we didn't know we were supposed to have and to make it worse it was my birthday. I didn't get her name but she is white, works with security and very rude. This happened on Saturday night October 5th, 2024.

Cashier only takes cash. There is an ATM by the Cashier for use.; DJ is horrible, can't different the atmosphere to combine it with the crowd. All bad except the waiters.; The front people are not that nice, especially one of them has an attitude like calm down a little we are paying for this service and even though I didn’t say anything other than ask if it was 18+ because young people were coming out and trying to take my cash out she said i tool long. For the price they should have better sound too tbh the bounce back sound is bad.; Let's not go over the maximum capacity.

Everyone is so friendly and make you feel welcome it’s hands down the best night club in Lancaster if you’re around in the area I recommend you swing by and have a couple drinks , enjoy the drag show on Saturdays .; Best of the Bestest, great music , The DJ is awesome. great service,  You will have a good time.  Lots of fun. I recommend 💯; Looking for a fun and entertainment? Exotico has you covered.
Upon arrival on Saturday evenings expect to pay a $15 cover charge pre person. One may think this maybe steep for Lancaster, but keep in mind on Saturdays you will have several drag queen performances. This is not a free show and performers need to be paid as they should be.
You can however get on their guest list by signing up on website. Entry will be free before 10pm if you do so.
Our Saturday night had 4 amazing drag performances. Please remember to tip your queens they work hard. That night there was also a special guest that performed, a up and coming new rap artist. She was also amazing.
They have a fully stocked bar, and let me tell you their mix drinks are nothing to play with. Holy hell our go to bartender of choice (btw they are all great bartenders) was Edwin. The drinks run on average $10 but they are not weak and worth it. Buyers beware lol. If you want something more tame order a Pina colada, and stay away from the AMF. To soak up all your drinks they have tacos $2 each, quesadillas I believe $5, and hot dogs I believe $5 in the outdoor area. Plenty of seating inside and out. Along with 1 pool table outside. The club has been drama free all the times we have attended. You have a mix crowd of all. All are welcomed no matter what your into. They have security which are strapped, a nice feel just in case some psycho wants to start anything.
The establishment looks to be well kept and clean, no trash or butt smell of sewer to be found. They have 2 bathrooms that always seemed to be fully stocked each time I had to release my toxic drinks.
The dj played a variety of music. Music was at a perfect vol. Music quality was great, meaning all equipment sound as it was working properly, no blown out speakers or about to blow out sounds.
They have a vip section/ bottle service. Bartender told use it runs $160, if that is something your into.
The gogo dancer are friendly and entertaining. They will perform for all. You can also tip them if you want a better feel/view.
Another bonus they had was gum to buy! Thank God! A pack runs $2 for orbit gum. Best buy of the night. I had major cotton mouth and the last thing I want is to be associating with people while having dragon's breath.
The only Con I can give are the shot/jello shooters that one may find when a server/ cocktail waitress walks around with. They run $3 each, about a 1 oz. chemistry tube vile. Mine tasted like pure 7up. I bought 4 and my other party members said the same about their. I would not purchase again.

Recommendation (if allowed): not to sure if sold but I did not see any for sale are condoms. Yes maybe we should bring our own however one doesn't always get lucky and I don't want to carry a box of rubbers, when I have a phone, credit card, a wad of ones for tipping and the list goes on. Just a suggestion as other LGBT clubs I have been to had them. Some for free at that but I would not mind paying.

Overall, Exotico is our local go to. I would recommend to all friends. Even my straight friends! as long as one is open minded and comfortable step on into Exotico I guarantee you will have a great night. The vibes are always positive, friendly and welcoming.
Fyi we always take ubers to and from, never had a issue not getting one. On average it cost us $12 each way for us.

Till next time.... and ready to always play safe ;); Drove up to Lancaster to check this spot out … Especially because the owner is a dj who used to play in Bakersfield &  when we can gotta show support  to the Latinos leveling up. Just sharing my my first time there . -.- The place has a 15$ cover which in my opinion Isn’t too crazy. I get it we all gotta make a coin. But according to the signs I did read 10$ for re-entry?  The Parking lot is directly in the back of the club which seems to be part of a shopping plaza . The parking lot isn’t well lit & that falls on the entire plaza but now that exótico opened :) the parking lot on the club side should sorta match the energy inside ? Could use more lighting and clean up. Once inside the club looks nice and the setup looks very modern and I would even compare it to those big popular clubs  on a smaller scale of course . Especially the lighting on the dance floor is very well executed. The drinks are not overpriced and staff was attentive & over all the ambient is very welcoming . Music wise . Top tier . All types of Music with a special touch from owner/dj. . Outside they have a patio where they sell food and have a pool table and the patio looks very well kept.  Restrooms are clean. Very private .  One thing to note they don’t allow alcoholic drinks outside . I was geeked to be in a new spot and I failed to read the sign … security guard came up to us  in a very serious tone . We couldn’t have them outside & there was a table by the door for us to leave them at. I apologized and explained it was my first time . Won’t happen again… as he leaves he comments something under his breathe . Earlier  I just had finished ordering a drink and stepped to the side to wait for my party and apparently a rough 3 taps on the elbow and a mean mug is the way to move patrons out of his way.  I figured it’s his job to be vigilant but when it came to the ladies he was all smiles and chuckles and his hospitality was top tier  .  I don’t need to u have conversation with me but hey don’t make feel unwelcome especially when your the authority of the night . Through out the night i noticed he was mean mugging at some and with others no.  Which I’m sure he can care less … since I  over heard him say these jobs are just temp till he gets a call back from where he actually wants to work.  Drag show was great ! Best part ! Some say shows run long but hey an lgbt friendly spot isn’t true if they don’t have these amazing queens.  Over all I’ll definitely be back. I recommend checking it out .; I like the vibe and the people.  The only gripe I have is that the dj doesn't pay whole songs (kinda important when you're line dancing), and the music is so loud you can't even talk to the bartenders.  People are going to end up with hearing damage."

Great spot after the beach.; Grace is the best bartender ever. This is a really great spot. Hidden gem.  Check it out but only if you want to have a SUPER good time! The pool and swim up bar is the absolute best.; Had a great weekend here with a group of friends in June 2024.  The place is a 1 min walk to a beautifully calm beach with great swimming, paddleboarding and any other watersports you want.  I think there was even snorkeling trips right off the beach.

The place is totally remodeled and a great environment.
The rooms are cleaner than most 5 star hotels in the states!  I am a bit of a clean freak and I was totally comfortable in the room...not even dust bunnies in the corners!
The staff was amazing and 100% committed to the guests.

Great pool with a swim up bar.

If you are looking for a getaway, this is definitely the place!; What a great spot! We stopped in to have a few drinks and the drunken muscles, both of which were super yummy 😊
If you can, try to get there when Grace is working. She is so great, and I can see why she was “Employee of the Month” 😉
Didn’t get a chance to check out the rooftop pool, but heard it’s a cool spot haha; We came here for a late lunch and it was outstanding. The food and drinks were delicious, Justin was our server/bartender and he is amazing. The paella, crab dinner, mussels appetizer phenomenal!"

I proceeded to leave my backpack in the stall and drove all the way back to San Juan. When I arrived in San Juan, I realized I didn’t have my backpack and called the pool bar. Sure enough, they had it. I asked if I could come by at 7:30am the next day to retrieve my backpack before flying out of San Juan. They were accommodating and hand delivered the backpack to me when I got there. I even tried offering them money for it but they refused. Super great people and location!; Full disclosure, we were spending a day at the beach and were approached by the bartender regarding free pool pass for the day. We had a long day already and it is in the same parking lot as the reserve so we decided to try it out. From the very moment we came to this place, we were met with excellent customer service to the point that it made our experience. The drinks were on point and very well made and the food was just perfect. It was a nice casual environment and we were able to lounge at the pool and relax. Highly recommend the place if you are at the reserve beach or in the vicinity.; We had a great time here! Staff and owners are very friendly, food was delicious, and Wesley and Alex worked very hard to take great care of us.
The place is clean and newly remodeled to look like a cruise ship. Some areas are not finished yet, and the back pool bar was not open on our Sunday evening visit. The place is great now, cannot wait to see it when it is fully finished!; After some miscommunication my group came and had a great time! We would have enjoyed it better if we were able to form a plan before arriving with 13 people but it all turned out to be a great day at the pool."

The club was big inside only a few girl at first. The beautiful bar tender Mia spoke English (from Brooklyn) was super attentive, please tip your bartender!.  We played coin operated pool tables as more ladies came in.  Since I don’t speak Spanish I missed out on getting to know some of the ladies.  Jinx,   and Lavender :-) spoke perfect english and kept me company.

Any way the place was moldy, dirty and the top shelf bottles had spiders webs. I’ve seen better clubs in Afghanistan, Seria , Mogadishu or Haiti. WOW! by far the WORSE!; I have been there a couple of times and as of these past months that place aint the same anymore, most private lap dances are awful no motivation what so ever from the girls… And dont get me started on the VIP Private lap dances 40 minutes listening to the Girl ranting about herself and not even DANCING just sitting next to me and it not only happen to me but to some colleagues I went with as well.

Free admissions from 9:30PM to12:00AM and the Happy Hour is from 9:30PM to 1:00AM The place was clean and the have hot looking girls even the bartender was cute. Lots of TVs around with various sports playing. Great food, they makes seriously tasty burgers and homemade fries for $9.99 and the hot wings $4.69 Safe place to hangout whit Armed security inside and out.; It was awesome, went there today, second time there, met a dancer there by the name Jade, and she’s just gorgeous.

honestly the service is nice, understanding and friendly

been here 2 nights already and I’m gonna bring everyone here I love it!

They have 2 private/VIP sections that if your a wealthy person or it’s a special occasion, I’m going to do it next week with some friends or strangers I invite haha

Also the music varies I personally like the bounce music to dance and the dj makes everyone happy!

The bartenders are stunning and professional! The drinks are perfect and cheap how they should be! 3$ beers all night baby! They have a great selection of drinks on the menu you just gotta scan it or ask them to show you! Btw they have all brand names in liquors and their taps are spotless honestly it’s like they have a doctor their spot cleaning it…..👀

(I don’t normally do reviews so this is rare forgive the long review)

security is very professional and TIGHT I’m telling you I never felt safer their is atleast 9 at all times and a few you don’t see 🥸😉

the parking lot is gated so you feel secure to pay for parking!

We need to see things like this at all clubs!

I personally recommend this place because of atmosphere and decorations are great plus the games in the back corner of the club outside are fun you can chill there smoke and play beer pong or tic tac toe

The bathrooms were very clean! And didn’t smell and honestly bro I can’t tell you how many bathrooms I held my breath in….🤢😷I’m glad they got some caring staff that cares about every detail

Btw it’s not very packed because it’s NEW so get in before it gets known haha!

Also if you see me in the guy in the island shirts or button ups haha with friends or by himself dancing so say hi Josh! Btw order a Long Island; Excellent service, food, atmosphere and music equipment. There are a variety of activities to do inside the premises and it is very spacious.

By far some of the WORST cannabis I have ever seen. The store itself is truly revolting and feels like you're going to get robbed leaving.

The menu is filled with errors and incorrect information. They don't properly advertise their products. If you're selling it trim or popcorn nugs you're SUPPOSED to mention it. They didn't. Now I'm stuck with 7 grams of literally trash bud that isn't even good for CBD edibles for a dog.

Nothing but tiny nugs with huge stems and the smell comes off as they left it laying around in the open. It smells nothing of cannabis and just wet moldy grass.

We tried out their new Bori-Mex menu and the dishes were really tasty. I think my only complaint with the birria tacos was that the tortilla is so toasty that if you try to fold it, it breaks apart. But honestly it wasn't much of a deal-breaker, since you can just eat the food that falls out with utensils. They also have a really cool fried burger that's really big. It comes with a dipping sauce. Their mojitos were really nice too, although I wish they'd add less ice to them. The coconut mojito was my favorite.; Wed giant mojitos are $5; To be sincere I only go there for the beer when I stop by the Plaza. It's the only restaurant that doesn't overcharge you for a craft beer like Ocean Lab.

Regarding the food, it seems very popular, usually whenever I go there are a lot people eating there.; I liked the prices, cocktail flavors, and liquor selection. They even had my favorite rum Kraken which is only available in the US normally. The staff is friendly but somewhat understaffed. Inky three bar tenders in the whole place. Since mayaguez is a college town it can get kinda full quickly. I suggest going in thier slower days for quicker service but the weekend is better for a nice atmosphere.; Ambient music is like living in a ghetto. There was an annoying alarm noise every half an hour inside the place and they forgot the aioli in my wife's burger. I ordered a Jack Daniels Pulled Pork burger and I was able to get a cilantro leaf on two bites I had. Was not supposed to be there...?
Overall it was okay."

Soft music and pretty decorations are everywhere.; Great cocktail place, has an awesome vibe with very creative cocktails. Check it out!!!; Went with friends all the way from Dorado and the experience was great. Its a small bar, very unique and very affordable.

They have some amazing craft cocktails, especially their ""Comfortably Numb"" - Woodford Reserve Double oak Bourbon infused with vanilla, coffee beans and Carpano. This drink is FIRE!!!! Jared is amazing and provides the most wonderful service.; The bartender was super friendly!! Perfect espresso martini. He also recommended a red wine that I ended up loving! Definitely will be back.; Awesome bar and especially Gerad. He makes the most incredible cocktails.

We were not sure what to expect but were very pleased with everyone one we encountered. The table spend was $100 and the drinks were very good and priced well.

There are free no cover charge options, but having a table in a sectioned off area was nice.

The only thing lacking was not able to get food, snacks or coffee

We would go back as the staff was professional and the vibe is nice.; Great club.  Recommend the balcony seating.  Jeff and his staff are very accommodating.   Great music.  Lots of fun.; Went here Halloween night like an hour before it closed for the night and the club itself isn't too bad and medium sized. The drink prices in my opinion were average but at least cheaper than the mega clubs on the strip. I like that it's got a balcony that overlooks Fremont Street Experience. Was a little surprised that there wasn't more people there than there was especially since there was no cover charge when I went which is always nice but of course Halloween was on a Monday night which shouldn't of been a surprise to me that it wasn't packed. I think its still definitely a place worth checking out when your on Fremont Street to party; No cover charge dance bar. However music was kinda old and lame. Mostly older people. No college kids here really; This place was great to our large group last night.  We reserved some of their VIP tables on the balcony overlooking Fremont St and it could not have been better!  It’s the only club in Fremont but it’s also the only open air balcony under the lights and overlooking the stage.  The staff is what really made it top notch... all of them.  Highly recommend."

It’s one of those moments where you realize how close and connected all the resorts on the Strip really are.

Lounge Experience:
The staff at Skyfall are exceptional—very friendly and inviting. We enjoyed it so much that we recently cancelled another reservation at the Venetian to come back and relax here. The drinks are excellent, and the bite-sized foods are a highlight. We especially loved the 8” pesto pizza with Parmesan and arugula. The Setting Sun with whisky and Kiwi Colada were a good start, both were refreshing cocktails. Their typical whiskey and martinis are also excellent.

Recommendation:
If you’re looking for a less crowded, chill vibe to unwind and enjoy the skyline with a good cocktail, Skyfall is the place to go.; Skyfall is an excellent spot to enjoy a good cocktail. The service is very good, and the atmosphere is pleasant, with an ideal setting for couples or groups of friends looking for a more relaxed environment. The music and lighting are on point, but what really stands out about this place is its panoramic view of Las Vegas, which makes it truly special.

I’ll definitely be back soon.; Skyfall Lounge, perched atop the Delano Hotel and Casino, offers some of the most breathtaking views in Las Vegas. Whether you're watching the sun dip below the horizon or taking in the glittering city lights, the panoramic sights alone make this a must-visit spot. The food is solid--no complaints there--but I didn't come for the culinary experience. The real stars here are the drinks. Each cocktail is crafted with precision, bursting with flavor, and truly elevates the lounge experience. If you're seeking a place where the views and drinks are equally spectacular, Skyfall Lounge is where you want to be.; I knew I wanted to visit Skyfall for the view so we popped in after a nice meal for an after dinner drink. The hostess offered a table but we declined and just said we wanted a drink at the bar. We rode the elevator up with another couple who complained that they were pushing tables and the place is ""dead"". When we arrived, they weren't wrong. A second hostess offered a table, which we politely declined and went to the bar. The bartender, Shaggy was friendly and made us 2 drinks. We listened to the music for a bit, which was ""soft techno"" and admired the view. We also discussed what would make the place better and popping. The space and view is incredible so it baffles me why it would be dead- it boils down to marketing and ambiance. I had to use the restroom and that view was incredible as well. However, there was nothing that would lure me back unless I brought friends to Vegas that had never been...; Food was subpar, but that's not why you're coming here.  View is fantastic.  Romantic getaway,  or just enjoying what Las Vegas has to offer; this is a must go for anyone who is on there 2nd visit+. Drinks plus service are good. Walk around to meet new people. Worth at least one of your nights in Vegas."

Water was $11 a small bottle and we had two drinks one margarita with a side shot of Don Julio and one beer anyway the total for those two drinks with the shot and the water was $133 with the mandatory included 20% tip but the view is worth something and the music is pretty nice.; This was an amazing experience.  I scheduled the Sunset Toast as a surprise for my friends.  The cocktails & mocktails were extraordinary.  The views were perfect.  We were able to see the perfect transition from day to night.  I super highly recommend.; Went here based on a recommendation from a buddy of mine. Like he had previously mentioned, the views were incredible. The ambiance is super nice, and the overall vibe is super chill. Nevertheless you tend to get a high end snobbish kind of feel from the moment you walk in. And when I went to the bar to order a beer, it turns out they don't offer any domestic beers. They only offer craft beers. So that was my queue to bail. Don't get me wrong I'm not necessarily trying to knock the place. I'm just saying it's not my cup of tea. But if you like that upper echelon kind of vibe, that caters to those who feel comfortable in a high society kind of atmosphere, then this place is definitely for you. I did enjoy the views though.; A rooftop club at a newly built property. It’s a bit outside the strip. The view is amazing. The wind is cool. The drinks are awesome and very affordable. Please note that they don’t serve any food. It’s located at 60 floor with an amazing 360 view of Vegas city. There are casinos and restaurants at level 1 . The cab pickup and drop points are on the other side of the road. It’s connected to the hotel through an enclosed glass walkway.; Location at the top of the circa hotel, this place has a very James bond vibe to it, very nice .
The drinks are your average vegas price of about $20+, but they are well served cocktails.
They have a variety of old fashions which I loved!.
I would recommend stopping by and grabbing an old fashion if you are into those types of drinks."

Gary keeps the place SUPER clean too; always on top of it; never a sticky floor!; I recently stayed at Gold Spike and had an amazing experience. The hotel itself is stunning, with a modern design and impeccable cleanliness. The amenities were top-notch, and I especially enjoyed the bar
But what truly made my stay exceptional was the outstanding service. Phillip, one of the front desk attendants, went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed. From the warm welcome to the thoughtful recommendations for local spots, Phillip was attentive, friendly, and genuinely cared about making my stay perfect. His professionalism and kindness made a lasting impression, and I can’t thank him enough.

If you're looking for a hotel that combines luxury with personalized service, gold spike is the place to be. I can't wait to return!; It was a dark but mostly welcoming place situated in old downtown Las Vegas. It was a bit off the beaten path, but it was not hard to find and within walking distance of the main street there. The people were nice, and the drinks were affordable. There were also large games you could play for free, which was fun and an interesting way to spend time there as well as meet new people.; I've had the chance to go here a few times while in Vegas for work and it never disappoints! Good mix of people and it doesn't feel like Vegas (I don't care for the Strip). Just a great joint."

Delano pool is nice.  Be patient for servers and plan on paying $8 for a bottle of water.  Pro tip:  bartenders will give you a large glass of ice for free and there is a water stand.; Horrible experience. Wait list was crazy and mask policy not fair to all guests. Lazy river line was nonsense. Just don't go for the Mandalay Bay pools.; We had a cabana and enjoyed all it's amenities.  Fridge, lounge chairs,  and lots of shade. The pool was very unique with a large chess game in it. The environment is very relaxed and more on the quiet side than other beach clubs.; Today I checked in. I requested high floors with a strip view. April the front desk staff advised me that they can honor high floors but no strip view but only a pool view. Why would I want to look at a pool in November in Vegas. Then I request to speak to a manager and the manager only option is offer a lessor room with strip view or pay additional for penthouse suite. So never did she tell me I would pay less for a lessor room but was quick to say I would pay $175 additional per night. Crazy I tell you. This is my 2nd mishap with the Delano and after this I don’t think I’ll pick this resort again. Vegas has way more to offer and everyone speaks to you as if it’s not their problem.

Curved pool floats are great for lounging in the shallows. Life sized chess board in the pool. very nice day we had there."

The ladies are talented and beautiful. They wear pasties though, so took away from reality exceeding expectations. Otherwise would definitely visit again and recommend others to do the same. You won't be disappointed. Good luck keeping your $$$; I'm giving it a high rating almost solely because of the girls. They are all gorgeous, with a variety of good looks, and they are all great at dancing and making the customers feel welcomed. The venue itself is small, and the private lounge is furnished only with foldable chairs. That said, it is clean and has a good atmosphere with good music. The prices I would say are typical for a gentleman's club. To management, I suggest installing an ATM and investing in more comfortable seating. Please note that the only baked good you will find here is cake.; Girls were hot and thick! My wife and I really enjoyed this place. Only knocking off one star because of no ATM- other than that, the place had  friendly staff, clean building, relaxed environment, and big booties! 🤤; I have been to different places in the Island, but by far this has been the best one ever!, Security, service, the environment this place has it all! As soon as I arrived to the club, I was greeted and treated like a king. I have never seen so much attention to detail for every customer that walks in to the club.; I recently ordered catering from here and it was really good. Yeliann was the one who I spoke with and she was able to suggest a menu based on my budget and needs. I coordinated everything before even getting to PR and she was very accomodating. I wish I had taken pictures, but it was so good that everyone repeated and even took leftovers home because of the generous servings. The menu was ""arroz griego, con pechugas de pollo en salsa alfredo, ensalada de coditos, y panecillos"". I also ordered a tray of ""quesitos y pastelillos de guayaba"", those were a winner with the people, they were crunchy and fresh. I definitely recommend this bakery!"

They distribute wrist bands that they require you to wear when at the pool area, I guess to keep track of whom is in there but that’s not my problem

Requested room service at 10:30 a.m
No one ever came

Pools are closed to the quests after 10 p.m 🤷🏻‍♂️ not sure as to why considering anyone who comes here wouldn’t want to be limited to any time frame to go for a swim

We asked for ice and the staff insisted they can only give you ice in a very specific container, one in which is provided to you in the room however I left In the room and brought my own container they said no… than I simply ask for a few pieces in a cup that I had they said no…

Staff can provide kitchen room service but no one has planted that seed yet or just unwilling to do so; Great place with amazing prices.  The people at the front desk were very friendly and spoke great Spanish and English.  Have plenty of parking g and even a dog run outside.  Minutes away from the beach and they even have a restaurant/bar in the main lobby.  Would definitely recommend.   We stayed in their economy room which was perfect for us, 2 people; king size bed, shower with hygiene products, and TV for relaxing.; Booked last minute and I would definitely not recommend. A bit over hyped imo.
2 separate buildings, I booked in the second building (not mentioned online while booking) the first building is taken care of more. That’s where the restaurant and front desk are located.
Upon arrival they ask you to fill out a form online, they give you a parking permit slip so I don’t understand the point of filling out the online form with license plate, car info and so forth.
Wrist bands are given upon arrival for the pool, but no one even checks them.
No self service Ice machine, if you stay in the second building you have to exit and walk over to the main building and go to the restaurant for ice. Which they can only give ice inside a specific container that can be found in the room. Such an inconvenience, I was not even able to get ice in a cup or a scoop of ice in my personal cooler.
The room I stayed in was on the 3rd floor, with metal container roofs, so you can hear every noise that hit the roof. I can see how this may bother some people especially when there’s heavy rain.
Ac unit is directly facing front of the bed making it uncomfortable to sleep.
No night stands just inconvenient small metal stools ( everything I placed there would slide off)
There is a breakfast menu in the room but no room service, you have to go down to the main building and pick up your order.
Room service only came by once during my 4 day stay despite having the room service request sign on my door.
I was charged twice after my stay, one for overpriced Fiji water
Second for “damages” which was a wine stain. IMO is ridiculous over 50$ charge in total.
Only good thing about this hotel is the view and pool area. (Which btw closes after a certain time)
1 star all around; The Boho Beach Club is an excellent and charming hotel with great staff and service.  From the moment I called for the reservation until check out we were treated with the outmost kindness and respect. Super friendly and courteous staff made it an awesome stay. Liannette went above and beyond to make sure our stay was perfect.  Anthony and Erin were super helpful as well.  They also have awesome baristas and I enjoyed some yummy lattes they made to perfection.  The entire hotel is super clean and my room was immaculate.  The hotel is walking distance to El Poblado in Boquerón and only 8 minutes from Buyé Beach. It’s also fairly close to Ricon and other must see/visit places in the west. I loved my stay there and hope to go back soon!! I highly recommend this hotel!; Was a last minute reservation. The host was friendly. The room are outdated. The door room not close well and make loud noise scrathing with the floor. Over the bed a mesh ""mosquitero"" very dificult to watch TV, is on front og the TV screen.The air condition close to the floor with the fan direct to the bed. Not confortable to sleep. The parking lot, very difficult get inside, just one lane. I had wait 5 minutes after turn on the hot water to begin hot. The place has a Power generator and that is possite, but I dont know is working propertly."

Definitely a great recommendation.; Yesterday March 31, 7 pm…The young cute girl, never gave her name, with a fro took our order for 4… we waited 1 1/2 hours… I personally went to the kitchen and asked “where was our food?” Our waitress lied… she must have had just turned in the order… because it had not been started. The ticket was right in front of the chef. We got the order in another minutes.

The atmosphere is nice, the food is decent but small portions for the price.; Drinks were okay. Food is also okay. They need more variety. Serving size is adequate.; The food is outstanding.
Loaded onion rings were amazing.

The lunch runs until 5pm.   Super affordable and everything was perfectly seasoned.

The drinks at their bar were not great at all. We also didn’t eat here but ate at the little town located next to it. Very nice over there and they do karaoke at night. Suggest you going over there instead to get food/drinks. The pool was cool and the beach was right next to it. The rooms had rust on the handles and the game room was kind of weak. But you are here to enjoy the beach and out doors and that is what I recommend.; Be aware. The resort does not handle guest room keys. The system has being down since January. Anytime you need your room door open . You must request the registration staff to open your room door for you. That is big safety concern.; The hotel is a very good option to get access to Boqueron beach. The beach is well taken care of and very good to swim. One thing that I would recommend is having a rule for people not bringing their own music to the pool area, specially with a loud speaker. Not everybody has the same music tastes. A single visitor can't impose the music he/she likes on others.; this is totally not worth the stars it has. I don't know why it's rated so well. the rooms are dated for the price. there's bugs in the rooms and no one picks up the front desk phone. when I asked for an extra blanket no one knows which room I am in. they say my room doesn't exist. the lobby phone number is incorrect, the one listed here is for the one in Dorado. no one is at the front desk after 12am, I'm waiting in the lobby for a blanket and no one is around even though it says to call extention 2653, they said they were gonna send someone and no one came.; Awesome place.

The only thing I didn't like was the constant smoke (vapes and also a smoke machines) that we were swallowing all the time. Got sick because of it. Overall is a must go and enjoy.; Was fun but no one was dancing. Just standing around but great music!; Best club on the west. Great quality music. Great bottle.service, Bartenders and security.; Liked it...although the music could have had some salsa, bachata, house or reggae"

If you happen to be in Quebradillas, go to Q, have a couple of drinks and have fun.; Best music venue around, good food and vibes.; Lighting inside this place is terrible. Bartenders with bad attitude. The bar area looks like a storage area for broken down appliances, boxes, etc. I was told to bring my receipt to the register to pay because the bartender couldn't come to me to collect the bill as if the bartender was not in a position to come get the bill from me. In every place I've gone, they bring you the receipt, & they come back to collect the cash or the credit card. The bartenders are extremely rude & inexperienced in their line of work. I asked to speak to the manager, he totally ignored to come to us. Walked right by me with no care in the world. The crowd that come here seem unclassy. Hippy looking joint. People dressed up all weird. As for the music, very good. The DJ was great! That's why I went there. Beer & drinks are limited. No variety. If I go there again, it'll be for the same reason, to hear the music. The place where this business is located, is a total ghost town. So, go at your own risk!; Great Place, love it, customer service is excellent, Noel and Agustín they both took good care of me and my family, Pizza is awesome. This place also is booming during weekends with either great live music, spanning from local jazz & tropical (salsa) music orchestras to local rock, & reggae bands, and even stand-up comedy show or any type of live show. This place is big, but cozy and air-conditioned. This place is Hip, you'll feel comfortable and the people that come here are very nice and amicable. Enjoy.; great place in the small town of quebradillas they have live music on the weekends and live shows on certain occasion. the place has air conditioning (its not a common thing in the area) and the bartenders make a pretty mean mojito! prices are super good."

Although they are caged and in relative comfort, the vet put them on a vegetarian diet and they appear somewhat malnourished. Otherwise the place is very clean and they keep the smell of the lions' feces controlled with odorant spray systems throughout the premises.

The funniest thing is that they allow AR-15 rifles and all kinds of shotguns. When I told them to return the $20 dollars and I was leaving calmly, they told me that I could finish shooting for the day but that I could not return with that firearm. I mean......

They made two announcements before it started to keep you updated. The DJ was playing well while we waited —reggaeton, pop, RNB and house mixes were playing. The inside is cute and well air conditioned. People were friendly and the vibe was good. The show was absolutely amazing. We didn’t have to give cover when we came at 12:00.; My favorite gay bar in San Juan. Great music and drag shows. Bathrooms also very clean and drinks are good.!; $8 cover charge, not bad, however the gentlemen who paid in front of us paid less than we did.  The drag show was FANTASTIC and the entertainers were beautiful and super talented.  The vibe is a mix of young and older, fun dance atmosphere.  The bar service was HORRIBLE.  Even after politely asking the bartender several times for a drink, he continued to serve others that jumped in front of us, seemed to play favorites with locals. Would I go back yes, but service could improve.  I appreciate the environment and would love to spend money, but don’t be rude.  If you don’t want to service out of towners’ ‘mainlander’s’ say so…; Slowest bartenders in the northern hemisphere. It wasn't overly busy and they weren't understaffed. They just moved at a glacial pace. 45 minute wait for a single drink. And yes, I made sure to tip every time I ordered; The decorations are great and drinks were good. $6 cover charge to enter. But the show started super late! We arrived at 12am and were told that the drag show started at 1am but it didn't start until 1:40am. Had to sit and wait for over an hour and a half. Performance was subpar and it was an older style of drag (ballods and ballgowns) which didn't match the vibe before the show. The drag performers we saw on Thursday were not well rehearsed, some didn't know all the words, and they had a lot of technical difficulties (sound and curtain cues). Very unprofessional and disappointing. Not a great experience for my first Drag Bar."

Their website mentions Swarovski stones, but they do not have it available. I would have given five stars if they had been able to fulfill all my manicure needs as I wanted rhinestones. I like some bling in my manicure, and they couldn't provide it. Other than that, the place is very clean, and a great place to get your nails done.; Went to get my brows done , would have prefer the person would have told me they didn’t know how to do the design.

Despite all our good will to try to find positive points, we can only note that this place is not conducive to a comfortable stay, in any case absolutely not up to the price paid.
Lack of hygiene, very unpleasant smells, breakfast included but never served despite messages to the host and 40 minutes of waiting, defective Wi-Fi, contradictory instructions concerning the use of the kitchen (which is in any case little engaging)... Add to that a host who refuses to hear our complaints and therefore refuse to reimburse us, and you have the total!; Very friendly and willing….

The dance floor and general spaces were packed nuts to butts. My cocktail cost $75 due to having to buy some glass. Surprised I wasn't charged a breathing fee also.

Great lighting and sound system; The music at the club is great, but there are some downsides. Assume boys and girls are promoted but girls can get in for free, while guys must pay about $130 just for entry, which is quite expensive. Inside, there are no menus or prices listed for drinks, so be sure to ask the bar keepers about both the drink options and their prices, my cocktail cost $70 🥴. The club is poorly organized, often very crowded, and space can be hard to come by. No one controlls how many people are already inside. Be mindful of the stamps you receive on your arm, as after midnight, security guards at the dance floor entries will only let people with specific stamps in. Make sure to ask about everything to avoid any surprises 😅. At the terrace you have a good view of the Las Vegas strip.; First time here, very well organized, was a Friday night and absolutely packed. But not uncomfortable. Got in quickly, bought tickets before hand. Loved this place and would definitely return. Good mix of people in the crowd, security and employees were very friendly and helpful. Drinks were extremely expensive but that’s Vegas: would recommend and return. Not a bad spot in the place.; We had a good time at this nightclub to watch Zedd. We were able to skip much of the line since we got the VIP bar card option which includes entrance, VIP line and a $100 bar card. The line can get VERY long so it’s definitely worth it to grab the bar card option! Drinks are $20-25 so the bar card is also helpful since it covers some of your drinks while giving you the entrance and quicker line. Small bags are allowed and they do have a dress code so make sure to check that on their website. Zedd was incredible! They also offer VIP table options at different price points. The club itself is very large and has tons of areas. They also offer different bars around the place. It was overall a very fun night. They do definitely oversell tickets as it did get quite packed throughout the night and some people can be very rude when shoving past you.; The most memorable night club in Vegas for me. The lighting, sound, smoke effects, the moving center piece. Quiet literally blows your socks off. Esp since I expected none of it coming in. The space is more of a tighter/intimate setting..but plenty of room to breathe if you get off the center dance floor. Highly recommend the experience!"

Definitely would come back if I return to Vegas.; DO NOT PURCHASE TICKETS FOR ANY ARTST THAT ARE SCHEDULED TO PERFORM AT THIS NIGHTCLUB! I purchased 2 tickets to see Moneybagg Yo perform on 12/8/23 and he never showed up. I reached out the venue and they are refusing to refund my money. I wish I could give this rating negative stars.; I went to Drais After Hours for the first time on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, 2023. I recommend purchasing tickets to presale online because they will undoubtedly jack up the price at the door. When purchasing presale tickets, select the correct day according to Drais After Hours standards. I bought a presale ticket for Saturday and attempted to enter early Saturday morning at approximately 4:15 am. The bouncer informed me that despite the day being Saturday, I should return on Sunday around 4:00 am. For instance, if you go to Drais nightclub on Friday night, purchase an after-hours ticket for Friday, even though it will technically be Saturday once you arrive.

The After Hours is super disorganized, and they do not operate as professionally or smoothly as Drais nightclub. The After-hours don’t have a presale ticket line which they should. Despite having a presale ticket, I watched people jump past me because they paid a “ convenience fee” to skip the line or knew a bouncer. After standing near the front line for some time, I informed the bouncer that I had a presale ticket, and he let me through. The bouncers never made any announcements regarding presale entry; they focused on announcing that patrons could skip the line if they paid “ convenience charges.”

I showed the bouncer my presale ticket and headed down the stairs to the nightclub. Once I reached the front,  the cashier informed me that I had to get a ticket upstairs to gain entry. Again, no one communicated this to me upstairs. Therefore, I had to walk upstairs and show my ticket in the area located to the right of the entrance door. I skipped back toward the front of the line because I had waited so long!

The inside of the club has a bat cave feel with red lighting, and three areas have a dance floor. I liked the vibe, and it has a more down-to-earth feel than my beloved Drais nightclub. People danced and mingled inside the packed lounge. I would return,  because I liked the scene inside.

My review could have been a 5-star. However, based on how extremely disorganized the staff and line for entry are, I deducted two stars. They need to tighten up their organization in a major way!"

I understand there's a user agreement where I shouldn't expect my money back for not attending a show, but I feel it is inappropriate to prioritize bottle service tips over being able to get inside.

I hope this venue considers putting it's dress code as clear on its website and the ticket confirmation process as it is on the venue's large entry sign... I'm adding a star for the understanding and thoughtful staff.; I came here for a networking event before the club opened. The drinks are extremely overpriced. Although the venue is large, the dance floor is cornered off and get very crowded after midnight.; If I could give zero stars I would. Doors are supposed to open at 10:30.. was going on 11pm without letting a single person in. We bought an all you can drink package till midnight. We were first in line waiting. My husband went up to the security and asked when about the doors would be opening.. considering we paid extra for unlimited drinks till midnight. Security kicked us out for absolutely no reason.. we simply asked when the doors would open and they took offense to it. Take your money elsewhere. Security needs to be retrained.; Celebrated my wedding with an after party here.  Deadmau5 put on a great show.

The music and Dj aren’t great. The bouncers act like jerks. The bartender was rude. Wait until Sunday and go to omnia instead. Also they kicked our group off the dance floor because we had a drink in our hand. Every other club in Vegas allows you to dance while you’re drinking not here. It’s so ghetto they have furniture ads on the tvs.; Enjoyed the service even when I ordered a bucket of water on my second round. They played the right music, great place for Latin music. Didn't know they served food I'll have to try it next time.; Came here on a lunch break. Not only did they charge me 20 dollars to get in. But all I wanted was to order food. Ordered at the podium at the front (didn’t even need to fully enter to place my order) sat and tried to enjoy the atmosphere but maybe it’s a culture thing because nothing about the show they had that night was appealing to me. It was essentially four partially nude women dancing around what appeared to be a man in a wig and dress with terribly done makeup and a crunchy wig. The entire thing made me uncomfortable but then again I didn’t want to offend. I just waited for my food. The server/waitress who helped me was nice enough so I gave her the change for my order as a tip. I haven’t returned because 20$ to enter this place is kind of steep in my opinion. The food (shrimp tacos) was okay. I know bar food isn’t the best but it was super greasy without much flavor. I won’t be returning.; Horrible experience
50th birthday trip to vegas. Uber guy recommended this place. I ordered 2 lemon drops. Gal with fishnet stocking had no idea how to make a martini. Served us two with ice, lime and cherries without vodka! $31 when I told her how to make them the guy got in my face and told us it wasn't a bar! They even took my vape at the door! Don't go here! Bullshit!; Not too shabby of a Latin nightclub. I have a already inquired getting table service for my family at a later date this year. I don't go out as much as I used to but I do believe this is a place where everyone can have a good time. Good music, strong drinks and room to dance."

We went two nights in a row for Rufus Du Sol, and then Diplo & Dillon Francis. One night was the regular XS club, and the second night was night swim. Overall, the experience was way better than we were expecting. We did not have to wait long at all both nights (max 15 mins), and made it through security with our supplies with no issues. Though we did see a group in front of us get their stiizy confiscated, and security literally pocketed it for herself (lol good for you queen). The bar service was very fast, even with open bar, and the drinks were strong. The first night we were too late for open bar, and drinks were EXPENSIVE. $55 for a vodka lemonade & long island. The open bar was only $40 and we got about 10 drinks each so very worth it. The dance floor space is kinda small, however there is SO MUCH space in the club as a whole, and you can easily find a spot to sit down and get air if you need it. They have water fountains and bathrooms easily accessible. Security was not an issue. If you are not used to nightlife etiquette, I can see how you might not enjoy this place. But as someone who comes from a big nightlife city, Vegas does it like no other and XS blew it out of the park! Also, if you have girls in your group, absolutely go through a promoter and get on the guest list!; Not sure why reviews are so low, but had the best new years evening of my life. I've been to many big cities(NY, London, Toronto) and many different clubs. This had terrific music, great vibes and good crowd. Was quite busy considering it's NYE, but definitely was an unforgettable experience.; I went to XS on June 9th for my cousin’s Bachelorette to see Diplo.

We had VIP tickets via the Las Vegas Keys and arrived at the club around 12:30 AM with no issues. The first hour was great, it was us 5 girl cousins dancing in front of the DJ booth having a ton of fun until about an hour later when we suddenly separated.

This club was packed to the brim with thousands of people, I’m curious to know if they keep track of capacity but anyway I eventually made eye contact with one of my cousins who was inside a VIP booth. As I was making my over to them, a 350 pound bouncer blocked me from entering the area and shoved be really hard with his forearm. I’m lucky I didn’t fall but I did retaliate by shoving him back because I felt it was extremely inappropriate for a very large man to aggressively push a 5’2 117 pound woman for trying to reunite with her family.

The bouncer ordered another security personnel  to escort me out of the club but before doing so I managed to snap a couple pics of the bouncer who aggressively shoved me.

So yes, I was essentially kicked out, couldn’t get back in and I just went back to my hotel alone.

I complained to the  VIP club concierge but he said he couldn’t do anything and that the club bouncers are known for being aggressive. I found this appalling and also read several reviews on google about other women having similar experiences.

What’s the moral of the story, avoid this club. If you go, be very careful if you’re a woman, make sure you’re not alone, and don’t be surprised by aggressive behaviour from their security staff because apparently this is normal.

Photos of the bouncer attached.; Two Friends lived up to the hype and turned a bad experience into a not so horrible experience. My group of friends (we were four girls) arrived at the club around 11:30ish on Saturday night, 03/23/24, and so far so good. However, when it was closer to 12:30ish, the club was way too packed and we wanted to go down to the dance floor to see the DJs better. The security guards were barricading the aisle that connected the booths to the dance floor. In an attempt to squeeze our group in after the security allowed us to go through, everyone was pushing and shoving so I was separated from my group and made it onto the floor but my friends were barred from entering. I told BOTH security guards I need my friends with me because a single woman shouldn’t be alone at the club while they forced me to separate from them. They also did not allow me to wait for them to enter. I saw that they discriminately allowed a group of five/six guys through with no issues but they can’t let four girls through? Anyways, security was terrible and ruined the mood. The bartender was the only saving grace and the only reason this review received an additional star because she was really kind and gave us good suggestions for what we should order. Anyways, for future club-goers, if you want to have fun, definitely a packed Saturday night should be avoided at all costs unless you can somehow get into one of the booths. It’ll be a mediocre experience regardless.; I had an amazing New Year's Eve at this nightclub! The atmosphere was fantastic, the design was beautiful, and the spacious bars made it easy to enjoy the night. The DJ kept the energy high, making it a truly wonderful experience. Highly recommend for a great night out!"

We went here for my friend’s bachelorette party and had an amazing time. With your ticket price that secures a table for your group and beverage credit equals the price of your ticket which turns out to be a great deal with how expensive 1 drink is at most clubs. There are designated security guards for each section that introduced themselves to us upon arrival. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The views and atmosphere is amazing. The music was great. I will continue to recommend it here for anyone looking to have a special celebration.; Bought tickets to the 2020 NYE event and was disapointed. Ticket prices were about 170$ each. We showed up 45 minutes early which apparently wasnt enough because the line was already huge and we waited about an hour to get inside. The ticket price included open bar but was impossible to get to the actual bar once inside so we left the cool nightclub and went downstairs to the less crowded beer garden for the open bar. The only saving grace of this New Years Eve event is the view of the fireworks, and the fact that you dont have to deal with the 400,000 people on the strip. My advice, find a free or cheap alternative with a rooftop view for New Year Eve.; The club itself is interesting as it is set under the Eiffel tower. The view from up there is pretty good as well.

The biggest issue was getting through the door. The cover charge is $30 a person. However, if you walk out onto the strip you can easily get passes to get you in for a much cheaper rate. After about 30 seconds of walking I was able to get $20 coupon for myself, with another one for ladies to get in free. This brought the cover charge down to just $20 for 2. After we got our IDs checked by the first bouncer, we then got to the cover charge counter and paid our $20 fee. Then, we got to the third bouncer who wouldn't allow us in because we had a bag with us. They did not seem to have anything coordinated between themselves, and the 3rd bouncer said the cover charge counter could hold a bag for us, but they refused. They definitely need to get their stuff together, because if I had paid $60 just to find out I can't get through the door there would have been a serious problem. I hope the owner of the establishment reads this review, because the bouncing staff is very inefficient. There will be issues if this ever happens again.

After finally stowing our bags back at our hotel, we were able to get into the club. The people shuttling us through the elevators were very polite.

Drinks were very, very expensive. But I suspect this is typical for all clubs on the strip.

TL;DR: find discounted entry cards on the strip. The bouncers absolutely need to get their game together.; I visited this club while at a conference. We had the whole club to ourselves as it was a private party. Great location and beautiful design as it's built into the base of the Eiffel Tower in the Paris hotel. You have to take an elevator in and out of the hotel so that can slow you down. Food and drink were high quality but no Canadian Whiskey :(; My friends and I came here last weekend to celebrate a birthday. Since we had 8 people in our group, we chose to get a VIP table. The service was awesome! She made us all drinks and a round of shots with the bottle of Vodka we ordered. The vibe was very upbeat and chill. Exactly what we were looking for."

The Nightclub on Wheels Experience blew my mind. They picked us up in style from the hotel, and the 1-hour open bar got the party started pronto. The scenic tour and Vegas sign stop were Instagram-worthy moments, and the complimentary club/pool guest list made us feel like VIPs.

Visited so that we could see plane Jane performing and LOVED THE CLUB.  Multiple areas that play different music which all have their own bars.  Each area feels very separate and the isolated.  Drinks were reasonable and not watered down.  With all the different areas for drinks, never had to wait even though I visited on a busy Saturday night, that happened to also be the 18th anniversary. Gogo Dancers were hott, and entrance fee was 20 for a Saturday night.  Great time!!!; Worst bartender! We came as a group from San Diego, a friend recommended us but the bartender named Jeremiah altitudes us very badly. My friend wanted to buy me a drink but I had such a sugary drink that I wanted to change but he charged us again. These payments were definitely canceled! By the way, I asked for water but he wanted to sell me a bottle. In this country cup of water has to be free if you sell alcohol. He didn't know that! He almost kicked us out of the bar with his answers. And because I was sitting at the bar I could see that he was doing all the drinks wrong. Too little alcohol, too much soft drink. If I come again I will never buy a drink from that boy.  Also last think; at the end of the conversation he told me not to talk to me anymore, I have never seen such a bartender in my life. It is really bad for friends who work and labor because they lose us because of people like this who do not like their job.; The worst club in terms of customer service.
I asked 3 different employees where the Main Stage was so I wouldn't miss the Artist's performance.
Everyone pointed to a different room!
As a result, I walked between the rooms and at the end of the performance I caught the artist.

I have no desire to visit this club anymore! 💯

Even the bartender didn't mix the cocktail well, he just poured liquid from two bottles and served it to me. 2 of 10! 🤢; Nice place but one of the barmen ruined our mood he charged us for drinks twice because he made it wrong drink we just asked its not our order but he did not take responsibility at all and started an argument with us he used very arrogant language against one of my girlfriends! We paid but definitely, he does not deserve that money and must understand he was wrong otherwise we can pay its not the issue!; My 1st drag show in Vegas, I went for Mirage but she was out on tour. But over all had fun! Will be returning."

They provide towels at $5 each (you can't bring your own inside). If you book booths/tables etc do so before your trip as they are super expensive. This place gets packed. Food was really good but don't expect to sit down and eat as seating is pretty scarce, drinks are expensive but very strong. Some great acts too. Definitely recommend this beach club.; Obviously it's the place to be for great pool parties and performances... this day 2 chains was preforming at both pool party and that night.

A group of cousins in town decided to go after brunch, all planned some had tickets others were on a list but brunch held over. Major cost difference but that was the easy part.

We were in line and I had a Nike pouch, fan, gum, a little bottle of alcohol, and yes my Lactaid pills (Iykyk lol)
Suddenly all these things were being placed apart from my items, as I was last in line I'm making sure everyone else is fine.

She hands me by bag and leaves items on table, in confusion about most, I question why are those thee, what happened. ""You can't take them in with you""
While I knew why some, others I was simply confused as the items had been with me everywhere 3 days prior to.
Things did escalate due to the dismissive nature of the conversation in which I do not tolerate. A simple explanation would suffice (as I was given later on by a security guard TO BE NOTED-- NOTHING THAT CAN BE INJ) simply stating a reason why shouldn't be such a far cry of providing good customer service, even in a security role.

Otherwise, pool party was great 2 Chains kept crowd going during his performance. Drinks were extremely high, ordered 6 frozen drinks and a cocktail and total was around $200. Very steep but whatever.

After a few in the group getting rounds we realized we should have planned for that section. So push yourself if you feel that maybe the case to avoid a lot of confusion and also offering you a place to sit, outside of the pool.

Overall not the best experience but for the vibes would return.; 1/5 stars - Extremely Disappointing Experience at Drai's on 8/18

We've been loyal customers of Drai's for over 3 years, with multiple trips and sections, but our latest visit was a disaster. The issue arose when my friend and I went downstairs from our booked section (pictured) and were confronted by an aggressive security guard on the 1st floor with braids/twists. He accused us of not owning the bottles in our section, which was completely unfounded and disrespectful.

As a long-time customer, I expect a higher level of service and respect. The security guard's behavior was unacceptable and ruined our night. We've never had an issue before, but this experience has left a sour taste. Hopefully, Drai's will address this incident and take steps to ensure their security team is properly trained to handle customers with respect.; Had a good time at a private event at Drai's, then stayed longer for an evening club setting. Nice music,  good drinks, energizing atmosphere.  Enjoy!; This pool is definitely the vibe. Went on a chill afternoon, no concert going on and loved it! Grabbing a cabana is next level."

Put a $500 deposit down on 2 tables at the Chateau 8 months before the date of arrival. Contacted the company the day before the date I had reserved 8 months ago. Come to find out the reservation had not been booked. The way I found out was contacting the Chateau Night Club. All bottle Service Vegas did was give me the run around. Bottle Service Vegas ended up booking a reservation last minute. When my party showed up at the Chateau we were told the club promoter needed to be there with us to get in under the reservation. So the $500 I put down 8 months ago was useless. The Chateau ended up being awesome about everything and help us to get two great tables and have a good time. This company is a joke! For what bottle  service Vegas charged on the invoice  I had for 2 tables and bottle service was marked up $700 more than if I went through the Chateau directly. So I got scammed out of $500 dollars. The club said it is honestly not a good idea to go through 3rd parties. Learned my lesson don't buy a Rolex off the street! This company is grabage. Thank you club Chateau for helping to make our night amazing!; After shopping around with a few different host companies a few weeks before we were to arrive, Bottle Service Vegas was the only one to respond in a prompt manner. We were provided options and various package prices to choose from. Rene was very friendly and answered all of my questions quickly. Best booking experience & by far the best customer service.; Had a blast! Rene made it simple to get hooked up. Offered some tables at the clubs we wanted but they were a little out of our range because of the weekend and our large group so he got us another table different club same hotel with the option to go to the club we wanted to see the performer. Will definitely use them again. They have different options for different budgets.; By far the best experience with Vegas bottles Services thus far!!!

Got the skittles and vanilla. Both were good but the vanilla is very light flavored. Dustin was our server and we loved his charisma and epic style!; I visited this hookah lounge while in Vegas, and I must say, the atmosphere was great. The vibe was chill, the music was good, and the place had a relaxed feel. However, something happened that made me uncomfortable. When I asked to open a tab, the waitress requested both my credit card and ID card. As a tourist, I wasn’t sure if this was standard practice in Vegas, but it definitely raised a red flag for me.

From a previous experience, I know that this can be risky. I had a similar situation at another place, and later found out my credit card was used to order a fridge from Walmart in another state! Thankfully, I caught it in time and blocked the card, but that memory stuck with me.

At this lounge, I asked the waitress to take a look at my ID but give it back, and she still insisted on keeping it. At that point, I decided not to risk it. I asked for both my cards back and paid with cash for each drink instead.

I’m sharing this story as a heads-up to anyone visiting. If you’re ever asked to hand over both your credit card and ID, be cautious and consider paying as you go or with cash. Better to be safe than sorry!; The atmosphere and food was amazing! Sal was a great help very nice and helpful. Definitely will rate this establishment 10/10!; I’m an influencer, so you can count on me to share on my social media just how awful your establishment is. We had a disappointing experience at Luna Lounge in Las Vegas. It all started with a 5-minute check of our passports and bags, only for them to tell us to throw away the McDonald's I had taken to go, which is, of course, understandable. After complying, we were then told we couldn’t enter because one of us was wearing shorts. My friend pointed out how disrespectful that was, especially after we had already thrown away our food, and that they should’ve told us beforehand!

Eventually, someone came over and told us we could enter. We were then seated outside on a terrace, on camping chairs and tables, all facing the wall. We asked if we could move the tables around to sit properly and actually see each other, but the waitress said we couldn’t and that we needed permission (what a joke!), which we finally got.

When ordering, the waitress asked for a passport, even though we had already been checked. And to our surprise, she also wanted a credit card “in case” we left without paying. Seriously?! There were five of us, two couples and a friend. The guys were ready to leave at that point, feeling insulted by this treatment.

The two hookahs we ordered were disgusting.

To top it off, when I asked for the bill, the waitress brought only the check but neither my passport nor my credit card. I pointed it out to her, and she said she had to process the payment before returning my things. How ironic! I hadn’t even decided if I’d pay with cash or card. My friends had to pay first, and only after I gave cash did she return my passport and card. Absolutely unacceptable!

All this for a $150 bill 😂 Seriously, did you think our group of five vacationers couldn’t afford two hookahs and two bottles of water? My god, avoid this place at all costs!

I’d also like to point out that at no point were we rude or gave any impression that we wouldn’t pay. Honestly, this place is to be avoided—there are plenty of other spots in Vegas to have a good time!; My husband and I had the best time here. The drinks are strong, the hookah is fabulous…and the music remix had me dancing all night!!!! Highly recommend. Great vibe"

Fillet cooked perfectly. Servers on point all night. My glass never quite got to half empty. Great job, Julie! The view is very hard to beat. Definitely recommend.; Perched on the 63rd floor of the Mandalay Bay, The Foundation Room is not just a bar; it's an experience that begins with a slightly nerve-wracking elevator ride which, in retrospect, is a small price for the panoramic payoff. Upon arrival, you're greeted by breathtaking views of the Las Vegas Strip, sprawling out beneath you like a carpet of lights, setting the stage for an unforgettable night.

The atmosphere inside is an elegant blend of opulence and comfort, with an intimate setting that makes it feel like you've stepped into a secret club for those in the know. The ambiance strikes a perfect balance between upscale lounge and cozy hangout, making it ideal for both special occasions and casual nights out.

I ventured there for the Heightened Shenanigans uncensored comedy show, hosted by the charismatic Gabe Lopez. Here's where The Foundation Room transforms from just another high-end bar to a comedy haven. Entry to the show is surprisingly free, a generous touch that adds incredible value to the evening. Just mention at the door that you're there for the comedy, and you're in. The lineup, featuring comedians like Trix, delivered non-stop laughter, proving that the room's talent for curating entertainment is as impressive as its cocktail menu.

Speaking of which, my evening started with one of their signature Old Fashioneds. Crafted with skill, it was the ideal blend of smooth and strong, setting a high bar for the night. As the laughs rolled on, I switched to Jameson and Coke, finding them well-priced for the setting, which often isn't the case in such an exclusive venue.

Service throughout was attentive but not intrusive, allowing the comedy to take center stage while ensuring your glass was never empty. The fact that this caliber of entertainment comes without a cover charge on what I discovered to be the last Saturday of each month, makes The Foundation Room not just a recommendation but a must-visit.

In summary, The Foundation Room offers more than just drinks; it provides a full sensory experience with its stunning views, top-notch cocktails, and quality entertainment. Whether you're a local or a visitor looking to elevate your Vegas nightlife experience, this spot deserves a top spot on your list. I'm already looking forward to my next visit, and if you appreciate good humor with your views, you should too.; Foundation Room was a wonderful experience. This rooftop bar has an extraordinary view of the strip, best at night time. It's a perfect atmosphere for a date night or to just hang out with friends. I would recommend Foundation Room to those visiting Vegas. Going during happy hour for better deals is an opportunity worth taking. Happy Hours are 6pm to 9pm Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Sundays.; Great experience from start to finish.  Had a VIP host /manager, Kaloni who took great care of us.  David was our waiter that was beyond top notch.  Food was amazing.  View and magician were magical!  Stayed for a table after and Chris took care of us.  Amazing display of true service.  Would highly recommend.; Such a neat venue! We worked with Jad to book a small private party and had great service by everyone involved. The whole team was accommodating and kind. Our attendees thought it was a great event!"

The atmosphere has that same welcoming vibe, and it's always a great spot to kick off the night. If you're looking to get the party started, definitely try the ""Ass Juice""—it's a classic! This place may be small, but it’s packed with personality.; Not so smashy the two times I rolled thru. Shows must be the scene unless their fake punk rock, always check under the hood. Strictly dives and ales, yaga yo.; High-quality dive bar. I enjoyed the house “ass juice” for $4. It was much sweeter than I imagined it would be.

Really friendly vibe. Great bartenders. Free music most nights. I can’t think of a single flaw, except that it doesn’t exist in SF or LA.; When you look up dive in the dictionary, you’ll find a picture of the DD.  This is a dive bar that includes live punk music.  Take your prom date someplace else.  On a quiet Friday we found the bar area dark and somehow smokey with just a few regulars in attendance.  The bartender was welcoming.  And the small crew at the bar similarly friendly.  A interesting blend of punk and rock pounded out of the juke box.  Two jack and cokes cost much less than one fruity cocktail on the Strip.  I didn’t order an “ass-juice” this time, but I certainly will when I return. I cannot image what the DD is like at 2 a.m. after a busy night of punk and general debauchery, but I intend to find out.  God bless you and keep you DD.  I like forward to my return. Oh yes, and the men’s room is a delightful homage to New York’s long gone CBGB.  Don’t miss it.; Was here with my buddies for some pre-party! The atmosphere was great and the personal was very social and nice also the band that was playing did a good show even with less people and also was social after the show. Great place to catch some good vibes before a club"

Probably they don't allow pictures because of their experience of it. But the decor was ok. Is not something out of the extraordinary.
Service was good, but you feel they are always watching you.
Also, I think they don't allow pictures because all the bathrooms were clogged.
We had to all go out and look for bathrooms in the casino, and they mentioned that this happens often and all clients go look for bathrooms with no problem.; As a day 1 Bruno fan, I’m so glad I finally came to visit here! The hooligans played last night, so I knew I couldn’t miss the opportunity of seeing him stop by and joining them later on the night 💗 The energy Bruno and the hooligans bring to the crowd is unmatched! I also ordered the E Panda cocktail and had the best bartender David! He was very attentive and friendly towards all the million questions I asked him lol.. 10/10 night out ✨; I cannot wait to return to Vegas.  This is definitely a do again spot.  We went for after hours fun.  There was a little bit of a wait to get in, but man was it worth it.  The band was killer and the DJ kept us jumping in between sets and once the band was finished for the night.   It's not a large place so if you don't like waiting, you can reserve seating at a premium cost,  but even that is worth it.  Can't add photos because what happens in Pinky Ring, stays in Pinky Ring.  They will snatched that phone if they see you snapping pics.  Just wish Bruno had popped in.  That would have mad e this birthday celebration a complete hit.; I went as my husband's +1 to a professional organization meeting at The Pinky Ring at Bellagio. The lounge doesn't allow phones inside but because this was a special event where the organization bought a bunch of tables, we got to bring our phones but were asked not to be too obvious taking photos because they didn't rent the entire venue out.

This place is very small and cozy with a definite 70's vibe. The dance floor is compact in the center of what is designed to look like a conversation pit surrounded by tables.

Apparently Bruno Mars stops by often to play with their live band, but this time they had a woman singing with a full band starting around 9:30 PM. Prior to the live music there was a DJ.

I had a cocktail called the Mars Mocha for $25. It was coffee, cognac and chocolate rum with a bruleed banana slice garnish and sesame foam. It was very good and not too sweet. I also had the $20 Skin-e Panda cocktail, which was coconut rum, pineapple, lime, mint and club soda. It was just ok. My husband had an espresso martini (great) and another cocktail made with gin (yuck) and they were STRONG.

The organization did not pay menu price for the bottles and between at least 6 tables (maybe 8?) Each table with stocked with different alcohol. One table was beer, another white wines.

Our table had a Krug, Grand Cuvée Brut which retails for about $250 (menu price $725.) We also had Henriot Brut Souverain (retails for like $55) but I didn't catch the menu price for that bottle.

Overall, I think this was a great place to have a professional mixer and it was nice to go somewhere with a full band rather than a DJ only.

Visited: August 2024; Wow!!! My friend and I went to the Pinky Ring on 09/4/24. We had an amazing time. We purchased a table for $100 and spent over $200 for alcohol. Pricey, but it is Vegas. We did get $100 credit towards our drinks, so that was helpful.

As a person of color, we were treated nicely, so I am a bit confused on the racism claims made in some of these reviews.

No pictures!! Those are the rules. Though, my friend and I absent-minded took a selfie. We were talked to by security. They were nice enough to not kick us out. Our sincere apologies to East Asian security for breaking the rules.

Other than that the drinks are pricey, I have nothing bad to say about the place. Everyone was pleasantly from start to finish. My friend and I will be back in Vegas from April 23 to April 30, 2025. We will definitely visit the Pinky Ring a couple of times while we are there."

Jeremy C was fantastic and made this a very stress free experience.  This was my first time going to Vegas, but with their knowledge and expertise, they were able to put together an event that was an exact match to what I was looking for.  They were helpful and quickly responded to any changes that arose during the process.  Their flexible payment program allowed me to pay for the event without putting extra stress on my personal finances.  I am definitely looking forward to using Vegas VIP again, even if just for a party weekend in Vegas.  Great job guys.; First time working with Vegas Party VIP and I gotta say that it was definitely impressive.  Getting in contact with someone that would help us organize our events was very easy and got a response quickly.

We went to Vegas for a bachelor party for a group of about 12 folks.  Romero reached out to figure out what the groups interest and budget was.  From there he quickly came up with an itinerary for our trip.  Any changes that we requested were conveniently managed which made the experience a lot better.

Romero was very courteous, professional and helpful.  He worked with our group to make sure that we got everything that we wanted.  Everything went according to how it was planned and turned out a lot better than expected.

With that being said, I will definitely be using Vegas party VIP for my next Vegas visit!; The absolute best way to organize a Las Vegas bachelor party!

Never having been to Vegas before, the task of planning a bachelor party seemed quite daunting to me. That is, until I discovered Vegas Party VIP. I did a ton of research on the various party/event planning options in Las Vegas and couldn't be happier that I decided to go with these guys.

Jeremy was beyond helpful and put together a fantastic package for our group of 10. On Friday night, we did the VIP club crawl. Jeremy made sure we were well stocked with drinks on the party bus (which was super fun!), and we never had to wait in line to get into the clubs. While Jeremy didn't come out with us, our hostess - Hailey - was super fun and did an expert job of handling some of the more inebriated members of our group.

On Saturday night, we did the more ""traditional"" bachelor party activities. Jeremy put together another great itinerary for us, and our host for the evening, Rich, made sure that we all had a great time and got where we needed to be.

Finally, I cannot recommended Vegas Party VIP enough for their superb customer service. Jeremy worked with me to put together a package that met the bachelor's desires while still fitting our budget. My only criticism is that it wasn't clear beforehand that Jeremy wouldn't actually be taking us out both nights. While Rich and Hailey did fantastic jobs, a big reason why I decided to go with Vegas Party VIP was that I'd only have to tip one person for the weekend (everything else was built into the upfront cost). While it wasn't a huge deal, it still would've been nice to know ahead of time.

That said, I would highly recommend Vegas Party VIP to anyone planning an event in Las Vegas. No lines, no covers, no hassles... what more could you ask for?; Awesome party planning and service! Went here for my friends bachelor and bachelorette party planning needs and they did not disappoint! Tristan was the one who helped me out and i cannot tell you how amazing he was! Always ready to help and give us info on what's happening in Vegas at the time. Couldn't have done it without him, your the man Tristan hope to be back soon!; The only way I’ll ever plan a trip to Vegas from now on. Carl Myers worked with me for nearly 8 months planning my brother’s bachelor party for our group of 8. Communication was great all throughout.

When we arrived, our expectations were exceeded. We had hookups at every spot we visited. Including a pool party at Daylight, bottle service at Tao and Chateau, waitstaff, and no waiting in line. Carl (and Chris) met up with us in person to ensure we were situated and taken care of before leaving. We even made adjustments on the fly that he accomodated day of (added another club, cancelled an event). Antonio Wright was also instrumental in hooking us up at Chateau (rooftop bar at Paris).

All of this was a fraction of the cost and headache of booking everything ourselves. And you truly feel like a VIP with the service these folks provide.

Thanks to Carl and his crew for making a memorable and affordable experience for all of us.

Cheers my man.

The glow of the neon signs, the leg of the faux Eiffel Tower and the sounds of the strip were perfect for vacationers like us.  The food was excellent, as were the drinks and all of our desserts.  My favorite were the Oysters Rockefeller, my wife loved her scallop entree.  Even posted a picture of it.  Loved it, will come again.; We had a wonderful time dining here. It was our wedding anniversary and the staff did a great job with making our experience special. Very attentive, kind, delicious food and great dining environment!; We were able to get in Cheri Rooftop. The atmosphere is really cool and you can see the water show from the Bellagio from the table. All my friends got burgers and I got the baked chicken, which is really good.; Eggs benny and bottomless mimosas (with different flavours to choose from) was so good. They mentioned they reopened recently and it was great fountain views, food and atmosphere with the dj. And great service, shoutout to Brandon!; I went when the wind was blowing but this spot looked like an excellent summer day spot.

The atmosphere is phenomenal & the bar tenders were fast and cool(probably because it wasn’t too crowded). A solid bar/club spot at Paris Las Vegas.

I’d definitely come back again when I visit Vegas and summer is back."

It is a great indoor/outdoor space with tiered seating, a dance floor, stage, bars and large display screen.; I had a great experience here, and the only reason I went was to see DJ Marshmello. The lights/lasers and visuals were very beautiful and the decor was lovely. In my opinion, you can tell a lot of thought was put in to making this club aesthetically pleasing. I was able to get a drink pretty quickly once reaching the bar, however I feel this is because I was there early (before 11) which I would advise anyone to be there in line early on before it opens at 10:30. There was a line around the block, but they were definitely prepared for it. Their staff has people go down the line and check IDs and all that long before you even get to the entrance which is genius and made the process nearly seamless. Will definitely be returning. My only problem was the dance floor was too small.; It's fine, good music. $20 drinks.
And like everyone has already mentioned, the security is on power trip. You could tell they were looking for anyone to kick out or not let in.
Be careful, I've had the security physically steal all my cash in the past, and letting​ the other staff know doesn't matter as they are buddies.; I wanted to dance on the stripper poles, but they wouldn't let me just because I'm male. The poles were not being used, yet I wasn't allowed despite a 2:1 female ratio. I want to be sexy too, why can't I shake my ass too? Some girls were up there just taking snapchats, not dancing at all. If you let makes dance, we would appreciate the opportunity.

Boourns.; Really difficult to navigate this club.  Came here on a club crawl and it was super packed.  People seemed stressed out though -- this is the only club out of 7 from our recent trip where I got dirty looks when trying to get through a crowd to the bar.  Eventually just gave up because not having fun and we went and grabbed a quick and much-needed sandwich."

We hosted a party for 30 and I liked that we were asked to pay at first (while we were still sober lol) so that way there would be no confusion- especially if you've had a lil but to much to drink by the end of the night. And there were no hidden charges and no trouble with my guests as we have been double charged for guests at other clubs. Hostess were very attentive and with our party size we were given a VIP space. Variety of bottles to choose from, the cubitazo were loved by our guests, and the option of adding hookah was a plus. Highly recommend!!!!!; The age group is for everyone! You will NOT feel excluded, whether you’re in your 20s or your 40s/50s.
The music is a great variety.
I recommend reaching out to Vlad. He was so friendly, and made my night great. He set up my table and bottle service for a smooth process.
100%%% recommend.; Went to La Jolla to celebrate my sister bday. We had the best time. Vladimir was the best VIP host one could ask for. Super attentive, welcoming and very kind.

We got there around midnight and waited ~20mins in line to get in. Even though you can get in for free by being on the guest list and arrive early, it’s totally worth paying $65 for 2 GA tickets to have the reassurance and faster check in.

Two Tito’s drinks were $50 which is expected. The dance floor will get very crowded and you’d have to wait in line to get in, so try to be on the dance floor before the big name DJ starts.; Bought tickets in advanced to see tiesto who did an amazing set and waited less than 20 min to enter into the venue which was nice. Unfortunately if you don’t spend money on a table you will most likely have no view of the DJ/artist. We were also not allowed on the dance floor and kept being sent to different entrances on the floor just to be rejected in the pit area over and over again. I would avoid this club and I wouldn’t go back.  Also it’s Vegas the main artist will not start until after 1 am.; I go to a lot of Vegas nightclubs, first time at LIV.

I was treated well as a single male. I got there ""late"" (12:30ish) not on the guest list, and was able to get in quickly. I got a rum and coke for 24 bucks. The dance floor was ""full"", and they were only letting table wristbands through, but however I tipped the floor bouncer and got in-out privileges. I consider that fair to get up in front after not paying to get in, and not having to stand for 2 hours if I got there at 10:30. YMMV on A-list nights. There is a small walkway behind the tables that people who weren't on the floor could stand in, but that didn't seem like a good view. The lights and sounds were great, and the talent came on at about 1:45 and played until 3. I would go back, but i don't think i would wrangle a group there without a table. It appeared the upstairs tables might have had a tough view from the ceiling lights moving around.; I was way too old for this place being 54! But it was really fun walking around and seeing the beauty of all the design of the light shows, the music was a lot of fun. I was surprised that more young people were not going crazy dancing on the floor. A lot of times they were just standing there drinking their drinks and looking around. The DJ was just great. Sound system is incredibly loud so bring your plugs if you like me! Overall a fun time.; This is a nightclub located in the Fontainebleau hotel and casino. It’s a moderate size with the vast majority of space reserved for table service and three bars on the first floor. It gets extremely crowded - basically shoulder to shoulder on a Friday night - and getting a drink at the bar takes about 15-20 minutes…that is, if you can manage to squeeze your way through the crowd to get to the bar lol"

I love the location - it’s right on the center of the Strip in the Cosmopolitan. Music could’ve been better especially towards the end, but I had a good time. Staff was really nice overall.; Nice rooftop club with a nice view! Place was pack and I feel the music was a hit or miss depending on what you like. Like any other Las Vegas clubs, the drinks are expensive. My friend had two drinks for $90. I'm not sure or how parking was as we just Lyft there and back.; Went here to a private open bar party. It’s dead center Las Vegas right on the strip! They had great music and loved the “boom box” atmosphere.

The balcony overlooked the strip below which kinda gave me the feel of being in time square but instead in Vegas.

Drinks were good and so was the food. Recommend for private parties or just in general.; Cray-cray good Vegas club experience. Great music from top DJs, handy location in the Cosmo.; Hip place. Ladies on the guest list get free drinks from 10 to 11:30pm. The place is spacious, there are booths with cushioned sofas and sectionals, large bar area where people can stand around away from the dance floor and still dance! Music is hip hop. There are several large TV monitors from floor to ceiling, great psychedelic reels streaming... an area beyond the bar area that's by the pools quickly filled up with the crowd, much more spacious but screened in, super cold on evenings like this but quickly heated up with the packed crowd dancing the night away. You can rent out cabanas, take dip in the pool, come near closing time there are dances in sea life costumes and lights."

It’s pretty easy to see that this is a very beautiful beach when not overcome with weeds.; One of the most beautiful beaches on earth.

We had all different experience levels and he made everyone feel safe, the views and the tour was AMAZING!!  We all talked about it all day after and he also referred us to some great restaurants and other tours to take which also did not disappoint.  We will definitely be back and ride with Jeremy again!!!; I had an extraordinary experience today at Sailhs Paradise Horse back Riding. Our guide, Jeremy, was exceptional, and we truly couldn't have asked for a better tour. He meticulously walked us through each step of guiding the horses, ensuring we felt confident and comfortable. The journey led us to breathtaking sights, including a stunning beach with striking jet black sand and the most vibrant blue water I have ever encountered. It was a remarkable adventure that I will cherish for years to come!; We booked the Black Sand Beach tour for July 14th, and it was an incredible experience. The ranch had more than just horses; there was also a parrot and a donkey.

The route took us through a beach, a black sand beach, forests, and roads, with some sections going through the sea. Even though it unexpectedly poured rain and we couldn't take many pictures, it was still a very unique experience and definitely worth it.

Our guide, Jeremy, led us the whole way. He was very attentive, patient, and humorous, and he pointed out sights along the way. At the end, when we couldn't get a taxi, he and his colleague gave us a ride in their pickup truck and recommended great restaurants. They were super nice! I highly recommend Sailh’s Paradise Horse Riding and our guide, Jeremy!; Great experience here. Jeremy was fun, stayed comfortably in charge and kept everything safe and enjoyable. Offered to take lots of pictures for us and you can see he has some great spots for photo ops. Highly recommend taking the tour.; We headed to do this mini adventure not really knowing what to expect , let’s just say pictures do not do this experience justice .. Jeremy and Licha were our tour guides , they were so patient , thorough and helpful. They made sure we were all comfortable with the horses , during the tour Jeremy and Licha made sure all the horses were behaving and that we were all doing okay. My family felt safe and really enjoyed this beautiful horse back riding tour along the beach and pathways. In addition they were great photographers and captured many memories for our family!

Watch out for the ant hills though.; An absolute blessing. Came in with no expectations, and found our favorite disc golf course we had ever played. We've had the ability to play around 50 courses in the US & this one takes the cake for an all around experience. Thank you to those that take care of the course, you gave us a round we will never forget. If you are in Puerto Rico & play it's an absolute must.; Vieques is a pretty special place, and for anyone who plays Disc Golf this course is the cream on top. Sure, there are fancier courses, courses with bigger budgets, etc. But this is a unique course, maintained by volunteers who obviously love the job, and surrounded by an amazing environment. The fact that there are wild horse hazards is unique in the world, as far as I know. 🤓 And the views are simply beautiful. I could spend every day of a vacation at the nearby beaches, followed by drinks at the local rum distillery (and food truck with the best fish tacos I've ever had!), and this Disc Golf course. I can't wait to visit again!; Fun, variable course that's maintained by a small group of local disc golf enthusiasts.  The first few holes get you warmed up for the more wooded holes.  Most have generous fairways, but the undergrowth is insanely thick if you're not accurate with your shots.  Unique extra features include wild horses that feed on the natural mango trees and a distillery next to the course that offers tastings. Check Udisc for a map of the course and local contact information.; Fun playing disc golf with the horses and getting to see a great ocean view was definitely a bonus. Although I didn't throw when horses were in the way because I'm not good enough to not hit them, it was still a cool experience."

Puertas is conveniently located across the street from Esperanza Beach with restaurants and tour companies all around it.  They message you before your arrival to ensure they have your details and message you the day of to ensure you have a smooth check in.  Lisa helped with every need.  I was literally across the street from my check in for my excursion!  My room was super cute with so many details that made it truly unique.  Also, they deliver breakfast for you in the morning in the cutest wicker basket ever.  And the best part was that breakfast was healthy with all of favorites.  I can't wait to stay again!; What an absolute gem of a place! I hope to come back to Vieques again and stay here. The attention to detail and service were incredible. We loved the breakfast basket, having a private hammock right outside our room and having access to our own cooler/beach chairs. There is a bar/nightclub across the street that gets a little noisy but Puertas provides a white noise machine + ear plugs that we used. Anything that we needed was immediately accommodated. We stayed here on a Monday night so we did not get to try the restaurant everyone raves about but we really hope to come back. This was my favorite hotel during my PR vacation!; This is just about the cutest hotel I've ever stayed at. I loved how small and boutique it felt with absolutely gorgeous and thoughtfully designed spaces. The service from all staff was so helpful and fast! Even though we were on our own in the evenings, any help we would need was a text away. The breakfast baskets were so charming and hit the spot each morning. The location couldn't be any more ideal. We walked to the beach and restaurants easily every day. I do wish the downstairs restaurant had been open while we were there but it was late in the summer and they had already shut down in advance of hurricane season.

Puertas' rooms are reasonably priced considering there aren't a whole lot of extra amenities (no pool, no bar, seasonally open restaurant) but again, anything you could need was so close - including an ocean literally across the street if we wanted to swim. We were a bit at the whims of other restaurants/shops' schedules - but that's island life! (Note: The very loud bar across the street is very loud on the weekends but Puertas' staff provided ear plugs each night. We were so tired after full days of beach and sun it didn't stop us from falling asleep.) I was also pleased with the beach chairs, cooler, and towels waiting for us each day outside our charming doorway. They even have an app for you to explore with all the info about the hotel and town of Esperanza that you might need. They really do think of everything.

I was seriously blown away by how beautifully decorated the whole place was. Everything just felt so perfectly and purposefully built, designed, and arranged. The ambiance cannot be beat. The craftsmanship of all the woodwork and doorways/windows was just the icing on the cake. Loved this place and hope to come back one day!; Hands down one of the best hotel experiences we’ve ever had! Every detail was so thoughtfully curated. From the picnic basket breakfast delivered to our door each morning to the beautifully appointed rooms with our very own cooler and beach chairs, Puertas truly delivered. We felt like we were the only ones on the property with little fairies catering to our every need. I cannot recommend Puertas enough! Do yourself a favor and enjoy a few nights in absolute paradise!; Pictures do not do it justice! Beautiful premise and room! Comfortable. View from ocean view room amazing!   Walking distance to all. Lisa is fantastic and very informative. She gives you all the time you need. This was an absolutely wonderful establishment!"

Comfortable beds, fair location, the staff are excellent, the breakfast is good, the cats are a PITA, but I’m not a “cat guy.”  I cannot state strongly enough how great are the staff, from the reception staff, to groundskeepers, to restaurant workers, all were friendly, helpful, and welcoming.; Extremely misleading wedsite.   They are not customer service oriented as they claim.  I've had better service at a Comfort Inn.   The employees act like they really don't like working there.  The view from the pool is a trailer they obviously don't highlight on the web page.    Room was very clean and spacious.  Must have a car if you stay here and want to leave.   They don't offer dinner.   The breakfast was good.; I recently had the pleasure of spending a night at Hacienda Tamarindo in Vieques, and it was an unforgettable experience. From the moment I arrived, the staff went above and beyond to ensure I felt welcomed and at home. The check-in process was seamless, and the front desk team provided a warm and informative introduction to the property and the island.

The room was spacious, impeccably clean, and tastefully decorated with charming island-themed decor. The bed was incredibly comfortable, ensuring a restful night's sleep. One of the highlights was the stunning view from my window, overlooking the lush gardens and the sparkling Caribbean Sea in the distance.

The hotel's amenities were top-notch. I enjoyed a refreshing dip in the beautiful pool, surrounded by palm trees and tropical flowers. The complimentary breakfast in the morning was delightful, with a variety of fresh fruits, smoothies, and local specialties of hash browns that set the perfect tone for the day.

What truly sets Hacienda Tamarindo apart is its unique ambiance and the sense of tranquility that permeates the property. It's clear that great care has been taken to preserve the natural beauty of the surroundings while providing modern comforts.

The location is also ideal, offering easy access to some of the best beaches and attractions in Vieques. The staff was incredibly helpful in suggesting activities and providing directions, making it easy to explore the island even with a limited timeframe.

Overall, my stay at Hacienda Tamarindo exceeded all expectations. It's a hidden gem in Vieques, perfect for anyone seeking a peaceful and luxurious retreat. I can't wait to return for a longer stay and fully immerse myself in this tropical paradise.; This was our favorite place to stay during our 12 day visit in PR. The breakfast is great. The views are stunning. The hotel is historic and beautiful. My family will return."

The guides were friendly and knowledgeable, and the horses were EXCELLENT. I rode Rico Suave and he was incredibly well-behaved and easy to control (I have a bit of riding experience but not much). The owner, Elizabeth, took a different tour out, and another guide, Trish, took ours out - both really knew what they were doing!

I can’t say enough about the incredible trail. It had a little bit of everything, including two walks on the beach, walks through the woods, walks along the street, and walks in a canyon/dry river. Such a beautiful spot!; Incredible experience.  Well worth it.  We booked a private ride and had an amazing time.  Our guide was patient and had an upbeat attitude ... she took her time with my partner who'd never ridden before (I didn't know that when I booked this!) The horses were responsive and we all loved the areas where we were able to trot and even open up into a gallop in places.  But mostly, we gently walked and enjoy the views.   The beaches were amazing, the scenic vista's were shocking, I didn't expect it to be as good as it was.  10/10 experience.  We plan on doing it again when we return.; Our trail host was amazing!

1.💥an employee gave me a cart when he saw me struggling to get one from the row outside.
2.💥 store is very clean, well air-conditioned.
3.💥biggest size store with wider walk-through aisles.
4. 💥best quality products, frozen, canned, dry goods, canned and otherwise shelf stable products such as juice or milk, baking ingredients AND the freshest produce, meat, and dairy we have seen thus far-the first place I have found a real dairy butter product (Borden spreadable butter with canola oil).
5. 💥fully stocked wide variety  of food, wine, school supplies, hardware, pet products, cleaning supplies, personal products, and kitchen products. This is the ONLY place we have found an implement to wash dishes by hand! I nearly cried with relief-sponges, steel scrubbers, combination scrubbers, brushes, even dishwashing gloves!

It is expensive, on par with every other store we have shopped on Vieques so far, but fresh beefsteak was about the same price as we pay in the state of Tennessee, USA.; Well stocked in August with friendly staff; One of the better grocery stores.
Eggs were $6.89/dozen
Milk was $7.07/ gallon for 2%.
Ground beef was $7.76 for not quite 2lbs.
Not too bad for island prices but just mentally prepare for anything imported from the US to be more. 👍🏽😊; This is the only grocery store in Isabel II which has gallon-sized jugs of drinking water.  (You may need to ask where they are located.)  Great price, friendly service!  Thank you.; Surprisingly good and clean. People are kind and helpful, prices can be high for some things but low and fair for other things.  I have been here many times and continue to be satisfied.
I think it is challenging to run a supermarket on a small island and this people are doing an excellent job."

The staff was lovely as well - the chef they recommended to come cook for us, Vicente, was a highlight of our stay.

I was skeptical about the open concept at first but it was worth it. Birds would hang out on the balconies and fly through sometimes, and the outdoor shower had excellent water pressure. This stay was wonderful.; This property is beautiful from top to bottom. Very well laid out space between the various room options. Spacious living and dining areas. Outdoor showers were nice and other amenities to really get the most out of the space such as kitchen equipment, items in the fridge, and sufficient space to really unpack and spread out. Agree with some reviews that it is really in the thick of nature. While there were some wild horses around, there were also many bugs throughout the day. Carmen and the staff were very accommodating. Thank you!; John Hix nailed his goal of helping guests truly explore nature using minimalism.  The views (sunrises and sunsets) are outstanding!  I loved listening to the sounds throughout the night.

I used the netting and slept like a baby!  The breezes!

You can get food delivered and you don't even have to leave the compound.

There were delicious wonders in the fridge waiting (muffins, assorted jams and jellies, butter, milk, juice, coffee, cold cereal, and a wonderful sourdough bread.

The shower!  I stayed in Solaris where the water is solar-heated.  It was such an incredible shower I woke up in the morning before heading back to the main island to take another!

I didn't get a chance to really explore everything in the Hix Island House community, but overall, I loved it!  The stairs were a bit much for my knees, but other than that, it's incredible!; This place was amazing! Initially, I was a bit apprehensive about the open concept and some mentions of bugs, but our experience turned out to be fabulous. It was incredible to see the stars while showering—an unforgettable experience. The weather was perfect, which made the open room feel amazing. The check-in process was smooth and easy, and the food/drinks provided were a delightful touch. The location was great, too. I would absolutely stay here again!; Solaris 2 DOG BARKED ALL NIGHT LONG!! The front desk suggested that it may be an AirBnb tenant down the road but that didn’t make sense. Who would bring their big dog on vacation to bark all night?

This all said,  I’d totally stay here again! This place is beautiful, inside and out. The architecture is beautiful and sweet. The rooms are open air, the heat was never an issue, the breeze was super sweet. The pool is cool and refreshing after swimming in all the salt water. The front desk has beach chairs, pool noodles and coolers for you to take to the beach. Everything you need.

A full-size fridge allowed us to store leftovers and freeze bottles of water for our cooler. The hotel supplied us with fresh bread, jam, eggs and coffee (for French press) in the morning. No toaster though (you have to pan fry the bread). FYI there is no restaurant at this hotel.

Outdoor shower was awesome. SUPER HIGH pressure got all the sunblock off!

Looking up at the stars at night and watching the sun rise from our bed was magical. Dog barking aside, if we go back to Vieques, we’d stay here (but perhaps choose a different building- or not). It was THAT great!!

Oh! And the Neeva Gayle day shirts!! I would never buy one because they are unnecessarily expensive but they were amazing to wear whenever I was lounging in our room."

Yummy bread! Ready bright and early but it closes at noon. A very nice seating area and beautiful tables, we came at around 9 and the selection of goodies wasn’t great but their pan de agua is really good and warm. We had a couple of sandwiches but thought the Cuban was a bit salty the quesitos were good and the guava pastry too. We’ll be back!; The service was good!!! don’t get me wrong but the prices are extremelyyyy outrageous! Coming from the main island and knowing that at a panadería you would pay maybeeee 18-20 dollars not even that for a few breakfast sandwiches with juices, you know coming here is a complete rip off & its mainly to take $$ from tourists since its one of the few breakfast shops. The sandwich was alright, it could have been way better for the price tbh.. I spent 40 dollars (it still hurts to say) on three sandwiches, 1 with just cheese, lettuce & egg & the other 2 with cheese, lettuce, egg & ham w/ 3 juices that were just pulpy juice you get at the supermarket (the juice wasn’t good) and one donut. When she said 40$ I literally couldn’t believe it…. Better go to the colmado (mini grocery store) thats two stores down & buy everything you need there! not only is it way cheaper but you can feed more people. Ended up going to the colmado & spent about 30 bucks on a big amount of groceries for lunch later that day (salami, cheese slices, bread, chips, water, juice etc) & didnt even reach the amount I paid here… yikes; Great place to pick up a sandwich to go and bring with you to the beach! I ordered number 14 which was so so good! It’s pork just an FYI. But they have a long list of sandwiches you can select from!! I couldn’t recommend this place more!!; Good sandwiches, donuts and coffee, but it is a bit expensive. Two of each cost about $30. Service was ok, but they don’t have dine-in seating at the moment so to-go orders only. They open early at 6am, so good for breakfast before catching the ferry or before exploring the island.; All we wanted when we arrived from Ohio was café con leche y pan de agua y pan sobao. And we found it!! Best breakfast ever (coffee and good bread). Their bread was super fresh, warm and fluffy. Just what we wanted to start our day. Their sandwiches are supposed to be legendary. The pastrami sandwich especially. Next time we’ll come for lunch!"

It was an amazing experience, from the hospitality to the cocktails! We had planned to visit and our good friend Glo accompanied us. I did the 4 shot sampler, then we sat at the bar where our bartender Alfonso fixed us up some drinks. I tried their piña colada, pain killer, and Crab Island Punch, all three were excellent. We also ordered a food sampler and I was very honored to have gotten a picture taken with the founder Ivan 🙏🏽 After our drinks we purchased some rum and my wife got herself and Glo some earrings. We were gifted some stickers and neck keychains as well. We definitely will be returning on our next  visit.
If you’re in Vieques visiting the Crab Island Rum Distillery is a must!! They also offer tours of the distillery, don’t miss out!; Tips on ordering and contacting the venue.
First, what a beautiful experience with friendly bartenders and delicious rum. I thought it would be interesting to take a tour and was wondering why tours were not offered, until I arrived and saw that it is a boutique operation. Quite small, and a tour would take about five minutes. Instead, we were treated to local live music; we purchased two rum tastings, and then we ordered some exquisite cocktails. Keep in mind it was a Saturday, and their hours are later on a Saturday, as they stay open until 8 PM.

The vibe is local and friendly and again, boutique. We did not try the food truck, though I am reading reviews here that it is excellent.  The food truck seems to have a porch and patio, so it looks like more of a permanent installation.

I had been trying to email the venue with no success and ask for a tour, because it was really hard to tell from the website if tours were offered. Though it appeared as if they were not. I finally called them and somebody answered the phone right away.

Tips on cocktail ordering: try some of the drinks you cannot find anywhere else. My husband ordered a Mojito, and it was OK, but you can get a Mojito anywhere else. Not a great order.

My daughter ordered the chupi, and it was excellent. So creative with the rosemary syrup. Really well balanced, and a beautiful drink. If you’re looking at the photos, it’s the one with the pink swirl.
I ordered the ginger parcha, and it was one of the most refreshing and interesting cocktails I have ever tasted. And we live in a town known for their craft cocktails. The ginger and the lime balanced beautifully with the passionfruit. I ordered a second one, because it was just too delicious not too! If you are looking at the photos, it is the one that is orange.

As far as the rums, we took home a bottle of crab orange and a bottle of crab coffee. Both of these rums were delicious on their own, and would be excellent over ice. We bought a big bottle of each and are excited to share them with our friends on the mainland (or maybe not. Maybe we will keep them all to ourselves! It will clearly depend on how well our friends are behaving!); Live music on Saturday night with the rum tasting and legit food.  Piña coladas were great, both virgin and with rum.; The food and rum are amazing!  So glad we stopped. Carlos our bartender did a fantastic job with the drinks!; Yummy passion fruit mojitos! HH $7 each
Open air bar concept with a kiosk next door to order food. Owner was very nice and fun to talk to! A woman sells beautiful homemade jewelry and dried flowers/herbs( for teas/cooking). A must do!"

I’m a new firearm owner and he helped me get comfortable using my gun, and improved my technique greatly. I also tried skeet shooting with him for the first time and was very successful thanks to his instruction. Wonderful human. I’ll definitely return if I go back to Vieques!; Sweeping vistas of the Caribbean Sea mixed with a superb shooting experience! When we arrived, Richard greeted the family (three of us) and we immediately felt welcomed, comfortable, and at ease. What really impressed upon us was how Richard stressed gun safety - it was the theme every step of the way. After an initial instruction on safety and procedure, we then went up the mountain to the range. And wow - what a beautiful environment to work in. But anyway! We opted for the gun safety and training with pistols, rifle, and shotgun. Richard took great care to stress how to handle and fire each gun safely. And most of all we had great fun! Richard runs a world class shooting range that stresses safety, and you'll have a lot of fun learning about the various guns and how to shoot straight.; Richard, the owner, took great care in explaining the safety regulations and ensuring a secure environment for my son, nephew, and me during our skeet shooting experience. Not only will you have a great time, but the views that come with the experience are priceless.; Hands down on of the most exhilarating experiences in Vieques. After our diving trip got canceled because of a storm we scrambled for something to do on our last day in the island. Thankfully we found Richard and his shooting range. He graciously accommodated us last minute and made our trip that much special. He gave us a thorough safety and shooting lesson and then the fun started. We shot clay disks for a couple of hours and the whole experience was amazing. Richard is a local businessman with a true passion for the sport. You wont go wrong spending a few hours with him at his shooting range overlooking the ocean.; WHAT A BLAST! I highly recommend this experience! I booked a private tour for my brother’s birthday to shoot at the Vieques Gun Club and do the buggy tour. It was SO AWESOME! I was super impressed by the emphasis on safety and the instruction was great. Plus it was fun! 20/10 recommend and will be doing it again."

Loved everything about being at Beatriz place…the service was wonderful and she was overal just great to work with. The person who did my pedicure was really nice and took her time. Will forsure come back whenever I am in the area!

PS Beatriz is all about QUALITY you will not be disappointed!; Beatriz was an absolute pleasure.  The deep tissue massage was therapeutic and worked out many knots.  I could feel the stress dissipate.; How amazing to fullfill my bucket list and get a massage on the terrace overlooking the beach at sunset! Thank you Ms. Deanna for driving over, setting up the table, and giving a wonderful 90 minute massage! Wonderful attitude, arrived on time, and was very thorough. I can't wait until my next trip.; Anyone who knows me, knows that, I absolutely love Beatriz Beauty Boutique and Spa! This is hands down my favorite spa to pamper myself and indulge in some much-needed self-care. From the moment I step through the door, I am greeted with warm smiles and a calming ambiance that instantly puts me at ease.

The services they offer are top-notch. And Beatriz and her staff, are exceptional at what they do. Beatriz has the newest, and most innovative, skin treatments. Whether it's a manicure, pedicure, facial, or massage, I always leave feeling rejuvenated and refreshed. The skilled technicians, truly know their craft and go above and beyond to ensure a relaxing experience.

The manicures and pedicures are meticulous, leaving my nails looking flawless. The facials are tailored to my specific skin needs, leaving my complexion glowing and radiant. And don't even get me started on the massages - pure bliss!

Overall, I cannot recommend Beatriz enough. Whether you're in need of a little self-care or looking to treat someone special, this spa is the perfect destination. With their exceptional services, tranquil ambiance, and friendly staff, it's an experience you won't want to miss. Trust me, once you visit, you'll be hooked, just like I am!; Edit: After several other attempts at finding deep tissue massages in PR, it seems like a massage that tries to fix knots is standard and PR is pricy in general.

Booked 3x deep tissue massages for 3 pax. We were able to reserve for late 6-7 pm and the next day 5-7 pm. However, our masseuse for both days (K, not Beatriz) was not very effective for deep tissue. For a hefty $110 for 50 minutes this was more than disappointing. If I was looking for a swedish massage, this would have been relaxing and to expectations."

Staff is so friendly and accommodating, especially Porsche who went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed.   The amenities here are also wonderful-easy and free to grab beach towels and umbrellas, honor bar with snacks and drinks open 24/7, and lovely continental breakfast every morning. Finally, the pool with fountains and the banana garden/courtyard are so soothing and the perfect place to cool off after a day at the beach. Thank you so much to everyone at Malecón house-we cannot recommend them enough!!!; We had the best stay!  Everything was lovely.  Daphney and Portia even made sure the weather was perfect for us.  This is the best location on the island.  Walking distance to everything that you need.  They supply the beach coolers, ice and chairs.  You want for nothing!; We came to Vieques for one day because our granddaughter wanted to experience the bioluminescence bay. We did that last night and it was amazing. The Malacon Hotel is a beautiful boutique hotel. The furnishings, style, the outdoor pool area, and grounds had to have been professionally designed. We had the pool to ourselves yesterday and it was so nice and refreshing. The Malacon is across the street from the ocean and has nice restaurants just steps away. We love it here. Had we known, we would have stayed longer but we already have plans back on the main island. We’re going to the black sand beach which is not too far from the Malacon today before taking the ferry back to San Juan. Next time come to Vieques, we will definitely come back to the Malacon Hotel. The vibe, atmosphere, and beauty of the Malacon reminded of Lamu island in Kenya. So beautiful and serene!!!; We LOVED our stay at Malecon House. The property is clean and beautiful. The staff are all so kind and helpful. They truly have everything you could need for a beach vacation. I HIGHLY recommend. I already want to go back.; This was a wonderful stay in Vieques. The staff were great; friendly, knowledgeable about the area, honest recommendations, and just overall nice people.
-The room was beautiful, #11, with nice balcony and view of the water. The AC worked really well! Appreciated the ceiling fan, small fridge, and we never lacked for towels.
-The extras were so helpful; coolers, beach chairs, umbrellas, beach towels, ice. The honor bar for drinks and snacks were great. Along with insider info, those extras made our day trips so easy.
-Location is great; walkable to plenty of great restaurants and bars, as well as meeting points for multiple tours. But you do want to get a 4x4 vehicle if you plan to go beach hopping. Parking is easy and secure, on site.
-The pool area was serene, pool was small but nice, and we used it every single evening. It was also a perfect place to have an early morning cup of coffee.

This is such a special place in beautiful Vieques. We are already planning our next trip."

The young lady who is at the gate is exceptional with customer service! There were two wonderful representatives in the pro shop that were without question the best customer service representatives I’ve seen thus far in Puerto Rico!

The golf course is One of the best you will ever play and certainly should be in the top 100 in the world. Being that this is US Puerto Rico it should be in the top 25 public courses In the United States.

From greens to tee boxes to Fairways To the rough you name it… it was five star. You will see my videos, and in my pictures how this course was stellar. It is sufficiently challenging, and yet it is amazingly playable. You can make par consistently on this course.  This is a $400 course that still provides military discounts and you play at the most economically reasonable course. You’re going to find I am blown away. I am coming back to Puerto Rico for one reason, and that is to play this course again

Facilities: five
Clubhouse: five
Hospitality and staff: 5+
The course: five
The practice facility: five

This is a must play!!!

And one last little extra tip to make it a 5+ plus plus golf course they had a 75% off rack for men and women and the deal was so deep I don’t need any of the things I purchased but I bought because it was so cheap!!! Now it is very pricey. It’s a very pricey clubhouse, but they do it right they make sure that there’s something for everybody and for that reason I’m coming back off to the management of this course you got it right and you got it right!!!

Hodge; Exceptional service & attention to detail, difficult greens, great layout, and majestic views. Best course I've played.; Bahia beach golf course is the most beautiful course I have been. I love the tropical trees, well kept grass and diverse scenery. Body scrub by Josefina is absolutely amazing and magical. The care and personal touch makes it exceptional.

I can see ourselves returning back here for another awesome vacation. everyone one so nice and the area was quite private. enjoy your stay and enjoy the sun. plenty of umbrellas and seating poolside.; This beach ended up being one of our favorites.

First, there is no service here so bring your cooler and snacks to enjoy the day.  No umbrellas and no one to set out your chairs, but there was always plenty to grab and at no extra cost.

No lifeguards on duty and we did encounter some currents so use caution with non swimmers and kids.

Most beaches that we have been to in the past have had white sand and no trees.  You don't really need an umbrella as there was plenty of natural shade in the afternoon from the trees, which also add to the beautif beach view.  We also enjoyed the uniqueness of the brown sand.

On the first day we encountered thousands of sand dollars in the ocean, but they were gone the next day and never returned.

The pool area appeared clean and not too busy.  The gazebo provides a great duck and cover area when the typical shower rolls buy.

There was a smoothie food truck that was open on Saturday that was an extra bonus as well."

It could have fed 3 easlily.  Overall a great property in a fine location being on the beach, near the rainforest and out of San Juan.  Staff were friendly and the hotel was not crowded at all.; We had the most amazing time in Puerto Rico.  The rooms are very nice and clean. The staff are very friendly and helpful.  We had a view of the ocean.  It was beautiful!  So relaxing and fun.  We would go back again and again.  The food in the restaurants was quite delicious. We highly recommend vacationing at Margaritaville Rio Mar.; When I say Margartaville resort was everything. We finally had a chance to experience this resort after hearing about it. I will be returning with my daughter and son to experience Puerto Rico and this resort. To add my room was nice and we were able to cook every night and when I continuously ask for sugar they did bring the request. Also , I wanted a snicker bar at 12midnight and they did bring that as well lol. To the people who is reading this review trust me I’m very picky ,but I enjoyed  my stay and go see for yourself and take plenty pictures like I did; If you don't like 5 pools, 4 restaurants, sound of the ocean, natural bird and frog sounds, 2 poolside bars and a walk up bar, strolls through landscaped walkways to the ocean beach, path through the jungle to view the confluence of the river to the ocean, then this place is not for you. However, if you like the things you read, then here is your high quality resort. Still casual though and staff and surroundings are difficult to equal. From restaurants to gift shop to casino can be found in this mega structure. Covered parking, room service and valet are available if so inclined. Car rental is advised as it's a way to the main road, about 40 minutes from San Juan airport and then all the attractions beyond. Convenient to snorkeling trips, El Yunque is basically across the street (it's a long street) and the forts are about an hour away. Quite an impressive stay."

I booked on golf now and paid $100 for Friday morning. Online price was $195. They give you range balls to warmup and water bottles. No starter or anyone to communicate that it’s your turn to tee off. There were only a few other groups so not busy which was nice. The course had a good set up, was fun to play, and had ocean views on a couple holes. Condition of the course was in the middle: greens were long and slow which was disappointing, tee box grass was a little long, bunkers had perfect sand, rest of the course was decent with some dry patches but it is summer. I would never pay more than $125 for this course personally. Hope this helps fellow golfers!; Played 01/17/2024  had a great round.  course had some amazing views.  the grounds crews would stop mowing or working when i was walking up to my ball.  then resume once i hit.  the pro shop was friendly and kind. 200 for the round plus 65 for rentals.  didn't figure it to be too out of line considering the championship style course.  definitely will be back!; This is a PGA level course with extraordinary facilities to complement the play. Maintenance crews avidly maintain the course. The Pro is available and friendly. The food cart and kiosk service is excellent with good rates. A must play location for golf lovers.; Great course to play at, well maintained, greens were immaculate and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. Clubhouse had a great fun atmosphere.; All I can say is wow!! We were so excited to play this course after the tournament. One thing I didn't understand was all the negative reviews about the course. Well once we finally played it made complete sense. We literally had to deal with the grounds crew mowing, and blowing grass all over us during our entire round...completely unprofessional. I went and spoke with the head pro about the situation. His words ""sorry"" after we just spent a $1000 to play. The course and staff made it very clear they didn't care if we had a good experience or not. Don't waste your time or your money!!"

Just returned from a trip to Puerto Rico and this Club met every expectation I had prior to my visit. Fantastic greens, excellent condition, super staff, professionally managed, and well worth the visit. They were getting ready for the Puerto Rico Open PGA Event and while preparations were underway and both courses were incredible. Do not go to Puerto Rico to play golf and miss this Club; Truly enjoyed the golf course.  My only complain is that a number of greens had significant burnt damage.

A must visit when in Puerto Rico especially for cigar lovers. Not only can you make your own cigars but you can learn the history along with the whole process of what it takes to make a good cigar. I learned so much and enjoyed every minute of it. The host Antonio was great and knowledgeable. They have a store with cigars and rum and other items for sale. Also have food/drink options. And a sitting area to enjoy. Check this place out, you won't be sorry.; Visiting Finca Neo Jibairo in Puerto Rico was an amazing experience! The staff were incredibly welcoming and knowledgeable.

Great way to enjoy a day in the Rainforest area. The guys that worked with us were really great.
The zip lines were easy to access, with lots of ladder climbing, and the scenery was beautiful.
We chose to add the obstacle course, and because we were the only ones doing it, it was pretty quick. The guys were very knowledgeable of the local animals and plants, so they passed a lot of that information on to us. My 13 year old really enjoyed it.
Definitely worth the time and money. Check 'em out!!!; Me and my 10 year old daughter enjoyed a great time on the zip-lines. The staff was incredible with making sure my daughter was comfortable and confident at each take off point. We both had a great time and enjoyed some great views.; This was the best experience ever.  At first. I was so afraid, but the staff made me feel so comfortable to where I wanted to do all 8 courses. I recommend everyone try this place.; I recently went on a zipline adventure with this company, and it was an unforgettable experience. The staff were exceptional—friendly, professional, and clearly passionate about their work. They took the time to ensure everyone felt comfortable and safe, providing thorough instructions and answering all questions with patience and expertise.; Absolutely amazing experience and top notch service from the first person we met and every other employee along the way. We are a family of 5 (kids 12, 10 and 8). We didn't make a reservation and walked in at their 3pm time slot. They graciously allowed us to go even though they were about full and closing up shop for the day. It took us about 1.5hrs (about 10 people ahead of us so it takes time clipping everyone in and out of the lines).

They send you in to get your harness and helmet- they work fast and efficiently. They were very friendly and great with the kids, trying to make them comfortable and confident. My 8yo son was hesitant about the heights but the way they have it setup helps build up to the bigger, faster ziplines. There are 8 ziplines total. The 1-2 are shorter and one goes over the parking lot, but by the end you're climbing up some ladders/towers or going into the rainforest canopy. The staff were so attentive- talking to the kids and joking with- them putting them at ease. All 3 kids completed all the ziplines!

Wear bug spray! They provided breaks to grab water and sunscreen. They had a hand washing station at the end and gave us cold bottles of water before leaving.

TIP THE STAFF- these guys work hard and provide an amazing experience! 10/10 highly recommend"

Employees are so kind and helpful, they are very attentive and easily contacted. The turn down service was a great surprise. My room was so nice and spacious. There isn’t much around the resort, so you can only really eat at their restaurants (the hours were confusing). The food and drinks were good for breakfast lunch and dinner. The only negative thing I will say is that if you are going for a quiet romantic couples trip, this isn’t the place. Children and babies are running all around unsupervised and screaming.

From the moment my wife and I began planning our trip, the resort staff exceeded our expectations in every way. Our interactions with the team over the phone were seamless, and everyone we spoke to was both accommodating and professional. They truly set the tone for what was to be an extraordinary stay.

Upon arrival, we were warmly welcomed by the staff, who consistently went out of their way to ensure we had an exceptional experience. Their genuine interest in making our stay memorable was evident in every interaction. The food at the resort was nothing short of phenomenal, offering a wide variety of options to suit every palate. The attention to detail was remarkable, particularly with the changing cheese selection at the breakfast buffet, which showcased the thoughtful care put into every aspect of our stay.

The resort itself is stunning, with beautiful facilities that reflect the exquisite environment. The combination of the breathtaking surroundings, the impeccable service, and the outstanding cuisine made our stay truly unforgettable. The St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort is, without a doubt, the best place we've ever stayed. If you're looking for an extraordinary experience where everything is perfect – from the people to the food to the facility – this resort is a must-visit.
Sent from my iPhone; Favorite hotel on the island. Small, intimate, beautiful campus (Audobon Society reserve). Great service. Family friendly. Nice restaurant, pool and bar options. Can't miss.; We recently stayed for 7 nights. I’ll start with the only con of the trip: the dining options are pretty limited especially if you stay for an extended period of time. That being said, the majority of our dining experiences at the hotel (food wise) were good, not great. However,
that does not include the service whatsoever…

The service at this resort far exceeded our expectations. There was not a single request that was not accommodated exactly. Need to preorder in- room dining for breakfast before a day touring Puerto Rico: not a problem. Need transportation set up? They will arrange it, make sure it’s round trip and text you the information while you lay at the pool sipping  pina coladas.  Everything from setting up your pool chairs, to shuttling you around the property, to delivering you coffee every morning is done promptly and with a smile. Every person we encountered was friendly and kind. They went above and beyond to make our anniversary special, delivering us a bottle of Champaign one night and truffles another. When our kids missed out on s’mores night (due to our own plans- not the hotel’s fault) they made s’mores for us and sent them to our room. This was one of them most relaxing and hassle free vacations I have had and that is 100% attributable to staff and their amazing service.

We also enjoyed the amenities  the resort offers. The boathouse is extremely fun and offers several activities for all ages. We enjoyed  spa day which was extremely luxurious and again, the service was amazing. While we enjoyed the spa, the kids enjoyed the kids club, where the staff kept them busy with crafts, movies, video games, etc. They didn’t want to leave when we picked them up. The private beach is such a luxury- no fighting for chairs or space and they come and serve you drinks and food just like the pool. The nightly Champaign sabering is a fun way to start the evening and the kids loved feeding the Koi fish before dinner. The views are breathtaking.

The resort is remote and surrounded by a rain forest and river, so yes there are birds and iguanas and other wildlife around. But we were not bothered at all and felt it added to the experience. It does take some time to get to places off property due to the location- but if you plan for that it’s totally workable.  It took about 35-40 mins to get to Old San Juan, during high traffic times it can be longer.

Overall we really enjoyed our stay and were sad to leave. We would recommend this resort and would stay again if we are back in Puerto Rico."

Adding to that, we had a defective sink and informed the staff during breakfast, and hang out the 'please clean' tag, but when we came back in the evening, nothing was attended to, housekeeping did not even show up! When I confronted the staff about it, they just said that 'we will report to management', but nothing was done to compensate for it, and in my follow up to ask about this, they even lied and said that the manager asked the staff to 'take action to fix the issue', yet from my side I did not notice anything being done. Overall just terrible containment of a small mistake from the staff. Avoiding responsibilities.; This place is a gem tucked away in the rainforest. It was a perfect escape into nature. The location is convenient to El Yunque, and the hacienda is beautifully designed and decorated. We had a wonderful stay and wish we could have stayed longer!; Beautiful, serene and a wonderful included breakfast. We went on a riding tour with Yari and it was so fun!

It has a full kitchen which is nice with microwave, full sized stove, refrigerator, dishwasher, etc. Also, a full dining table for 6 people. Room was nice and bathroom also okay. The living room, however, left much to be desired. It has two couches that can be used as sleeper sofas. They were sooo dirty and in such bad shape it was very disgusting. We would expect a hotel like this one to care for these kinds of details. These couches should really be replaced ASAP. Vacation club amenities were nice and people behind the desk were very friendly. But the room living room needs to be addressed for me to want to stay there again.; We loved our stay at Coco Beach! The Hyatt resort is beautiful, directly on the ocean with a huge pool, space for everyone. The restaurants on site were very tasty! You do need to reserve your table in agave if you want to eat on site as they were booked full every night! The staff was great, very friendly. The weather was absolutely gorgeous, warm and sunny! Bring sunscreen!  This is a gated community, and we felt very secure never being on this island before. Most people speak English  & Spanish. Road signs are in Spanish and distance is in kilometers, which was Very different for us. 😅 There are a lot of potholes on the island and locals drive very fast,  sort of like Boston.😂; The resort was gorgeous. The main pool was quite large. The beach was no big deal for me coming from Florida. But all the decorations were quite nice. The hotel is a bit out of the way so you really need to rent a car.; This resort is so beautiful. I have come two years in a row. This is the place if you are ready to relax and just get away. If you plan on leaving the resort you need a car to enjoy the island. Greet location for you to get around the island and enjoy all what Puerto Rico has to offer.; Beautifully scenery and great location. Good service and delicious food. Good for families or couples. They have a kids club. Rooms are clean and comfortable.  Great and free wifi. You can choose from a variety of restaurants or just have room service, but it's a bitpricey.  They also have a golf course. We have a nice time."

The course is in great condition and only costs 40$ to play. The wildlife will come up and look at you (including nice iguanas) and there are beautiful views of the rainforest mountains. Hole sixteen is gorgeous with views of the ocean past amazing palm trees laced around the whole hole. The staff and hospitality are excellent and Manny (I think was his name) was very helpful when checking you in and greeting you immediately. The golf store is wonderful and has great polos.; I recently played the River course while staying at the Wyndham Grand Rio Mar Golf & Beach resort. This review is for this particular golf course only.

Pros:
The golf course has great views. You can often see the rainforest in the background and almost every hole is lined with palm trees. There is lots of water but each hole feels unique. The fairways are in great shape. The sand traps are decent, but could use more to have more fluff. The tee boxes are decent, but some of them were a bit more beat up than others. The rental clubs are a nice set of Ping G425s and they also supply you with two sleeves. They do have a driving range with free range balls available. Also, they have a putting green/chipping area. Lastly, the cart girl came around a lot and had all the beverages you would expect.

Cons:
The greens are quite bad. They are super slow and a lot of them have issues where there is no grass, just sand. However, the biggest issue is that the price for this type of course is much higher than you would expect given the quality. All in I paid $262 ($70 of that is rental clubs). That price puts it in line with some of the nicer public courses you can play in the 50 states, which this course simply is not.

Overall, I still enjoyed my time golfing on this course despite the high price tag. If you are OK with paying a premium to golf in the winter months while you are vacation, then I would suggest booking a tee time.; Golf review only! Very disappointed. Been looking forward to playing here since moving to PR. Thought since it was Troon it would be in good shape but it was not! Range - bad. Greens - bad. Grass - long and fluffy. Tee boxes - very bad. Home #16 is the only ocean hole. Took a moment to enjoy the beach. But the hole was in bad shape and really long for a par 3. Staff was friendly and that was the only good thing.  I don’t think I’ll play there again.; Played River Course this morning with an ancient set of Kmarts from the resort freebies. Hot and humid, but the rain stayed away.; I need to preface my review first….
I wanted to plan a group golf outing while in my wedding cruise that had a stop in San Juan, PR.
I had tried multiple times, and I mean close to a dozen times to communicate with the staff and facility to make this a reality.
After those failed attempts, I utilized my Concierge Services through my American Express card and they were able to get the ball really rolling.

Once I was put in direct contact with management, the process was quite smooth.

The staff were friendly, attentive, courteous and respectful.

Amenities were good and welcoming.

There were many requests that I had made and those requests were fulfilled.

Some other items that had been offered and agreed upon were not fulfilled which was a disappointment to myself and my guests.

Course is challenging but fun.

I would recommend Wyndam Grand Rio Mar to others, but I would be upfront about my experience."

Gabriel, watched over us throughout our stay to ensure we had everything we needed and gave us suggestions of things to do and places to visit.
El macho, was phenomenal. He drives the cart around picking up and dropping off people treating everyone with respect and care.
Gotta say, we were very pleased and will return.
Ricardo; Hotel grounds are beautiful, and given we went during a week when occupancy was very low the experience was nice, quiet and relaxing. Beyond that however, I can see an experience during more crowded times that would be chaotic and the opposite of relaxing. I was traveling with a small family and despite a tremendous amount of empty rooms on property I was shocked that there are none that can accommodate a family beyond a few private villas reserved for those with much deeper pockets, which seems like a huge mismatch between sheer quantity of rooms and the types of travelers you can accommodate. Staff were quite nice, and the physical location is very nice, but the overall experience just doesn't meet what should be a high bar deserving of the 'Grand Reserve' title.; We had read some negative reviews before coming, so we were a little nervous about what to expect, but our stay was AMAZING! The food and drink prices were exactly what you would expect and comparable to places off site (except the breakfast buffet is way overpriced). The pool is probably the best pool I’ve been in. It’s huge with plenty of space to swim and play. The beach is calm and quiet (don’t expect waves). The rooms were spacious and served our family of 4 well for the week. With our family it was easiest to eat dinner at Brassire (Water’s Edge during the day) or the Lobby Bar. The food truck for lunch was great. Our room was cleaned every day. The grounds are beautiful. We had a car to do lots of adventures off site and it’s probably best to have a car. Overall, we loved our stay and would happily come back!; Nice beach.  Housekeeping doesn't do a great job and seem to be overworked.  One told me she has to clean 14 rooms a day. Pool is smaller than the pics.  Restaurants are decent. 45+ min from anything. Looks like they have a good golf course.  Wouldn't stay here again..; Everything about my stay at the Hyatt Regency Grand Reserve was amazing! I was nervous after reading previous negative reviews, but the location, room, and overall resort property were PERFECT! I’m so glad that I didn’t allow the negative reviews to sway my decision to stay here. I’ve stayed in San Juan in the past but this was a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend and plan on staying at this property again."

The relation between quantity, quality, taste, presentation and price it’s not balanced, kind overpriced and definitely can be better in all the mentioned areas… keep in mind: you’re in a luxury resort.
Really nice Ocean View during the day time, and I suggest you to eat outside to enjoy the sea breeze while you’re eating.

The Servers Angel and Orlando are always assisting quickly with a smile on their faces and professionalism.; The dress code is advertised to be resort casual  (long pants, closed toe shoes) but the majority of the customers seem to be residents who were extremely casually dressed. There was a very loud party inside, so loud that they only explanation they were allowed to continue t be loud is that they were regulars / residents.  The food was just ok and below expectations at this price range and the service was very slow - it took over an hour to get our food and the waiter didn’t come to check on us often enough so we ended up running out of drinks and wait quite a long time for him to stop by.; Waited for 40 minutes for a cold hamburger that cost $28.  They took it off the total but charged me $20 for water that I drank while waiting for the food.  They claimed it was bottled water, but I never saw or ordered bottled water.  I ordered still water.  I felt I had been conned and I hate a con artist , so this review is for you.  Buyer beware!  The rest of the food was boring and below average but priced exorbitantly.  I know it’s a resort but if you charge these prices I expect the food to be excellent.  This place is not worth the time or money.; Had dinner here during our stay at the St Regis. We were here during the slow season so the restaurant was not very busy. The food was excellent. We shared the snapper which was cooked and plated perfectly. The St Regis offered transportation from the hotel via golf cart but if you walk along the beach the restaurant is a manageable walk from the hotel.; This was our farewell dinner and it didn’t disappoint!!!
Wonderful views, service and food.
We started with the cauliflower and ceviche. Then we had the red snapper with mofongo. Yum!! To finish we got the cream brûlée.
Angel and I think Leonell our server were absolutely kind and accommodating.
The chef even came out to talk to us and share some food tips to practice at home.
I will highly recommend this restaurant."

They weren’t moving anyone else, even people who didn’t have drinks or hookah, and there was nowhere for us to go because the place is small and packed. Security was a team of two imbeciles who were sent to rough us up and get us out of there so they can bring in the next group of people to take advantage of.

A white male security staff member, supposedly tasked with ensuring safety, exhibited unprofessionalism and disrespect. He forcibly grabbed my arm under the pretext of speaking ""Spanish"" to me, solely because of ""my Hispanic appearance"" (his words). Despite calmly explaining that I was looking for my companion and not causing any disruption, he callously dragged me out, using excessive force. It's worth noting that even other club staff members were urging him to release me.

Additionally, this security guy, hired to maintain order, had been dancing the night away instead of prioritizing his responsibilities. It's baffling that he felt compelled to exert force on me, a 5'5"" female who posed no threat and was simply trying to locate someone. The club was full of people, yet he singled me out, displaying a blatant disregard for professionalism.

When questioned about his unnecessary use of force, he cited my failure to follow his ""directive"" to turn around. However, his inconsistency was glaring, as he passed numerous individuals without enforcing such directives. This incident has left me extremely disappointed. Never to return to this establishment. I am compelled to share my experience with family and friends, as it's disheartening to witness individuals with the slightest authority abusing their roles, prioritizing personal issues/frustrations over safety.; It's always a blast hanging out there, drinking and dancing in their 3 dance floors. I do miss the karaoke spot on Saturdays.. but specifically now I the winter it's the best place to go party cause of the cold  ❄️😁🎶; They’re only job is to keep beer cold for their customers and they failed, last 4 times i ‘ve been there, the beer downstairs is warm, no wonder i see less and less people every-time i go there, keep selling warm beer and soon you’ll be outta business, sorry!; Came to celebrate a friends bday and a person who claimed he was the DJ just came and took my seat and used an excuse he couldn’t hear hear me. After siting at my set they continued to bump into me as they wanted me to move forcefully. I will never come to this place. They also have so many violations in the facility. Stairway is not secure to down stairs club Will not come to this place again. People who think they have the right to bump you off you chair because they fell they have the righter way is not they way to do business.. This place is a fire hazard.; Bartenders are inattentive. Extremely poor service.  At the bar over 15 minutes, front, bar top, and still wasn't able to get a drink. Music is pretty good but terrible service without a doubt from the bartenders at the first bar. Place gets packed. Women restroom downstairs. Messy floor. Completely wet."

I sat at the bar and watched them squeeze oranges, lemons, even passion fruit 😍 the wings were SO GOOD, so crispy, so perfect. The fish taco had TWO fish fillets, deliciously crispy, so thick you can’t close the tortilla. The drinks were great but the best was the conversation tbh. It’s family-owned so the vibes were perfect. Can’t wait to come back!; If you're a tattoo loving metal head, this is the spot for you! The owner, Falu, is an extremely friendly and professional bartender who runs the most fun bar on luquillo Beach. That man and his crew truly made me feel at home. On Sundays, they also hold Karaoke if you feel like singing your sole out or want to listen to one of the incredible bartenders Scream some Slipknot! If you get the chance to hear Jake's voice, you'll see that tattoo tavern is the bar for any alt/goth lover.

PS, Richard's the guy that got me to visit the bar. A true local and gentleman of tattoo tavern; The burger, Buffalo wings, and daiquiris are absolutely delicious! Everyone was so friendly. I know this isn’t typical Puerto Rican food, but I think this was the BEST burger I have ever had. The live music was really good as well, this is a perfect spot for dinner; Good place with good music 🎶 and Karaoke 🎤 Chicken wings with spicy sauce delicious 😋 👌 😍; We came here on a whim from El Yunque after hearing it was a great place for a cold beer and a snack after sweating through our clothes hiking to Mt. Britton. Our advice was SO correct! Ingrid, the bartender, guided me through her favorite local beers, and brought out some homemade hot sauce after we ordered two plates of (delicious) nachos! It's dark, the music's great, and Ingrid was a wealth of knowledge about where else to go and what to do. If I lived closer, I'd probably be a regular here."

Just a great place at an amazing price. A gem of a place.
Cons- Swimming is not easy at this time of the year- more for surfing.  Parking can be tricky. - they have some spots, but I could see them fill up quickly when it is busier.  And unlike a hotel, the space you can just sit and read a book and look out at the view isn't airconditioned. This could be a dealbreaker for some people.; I stayed at Casa Coral for 12 nights with my two children. I was hesitant to stay at a hostel with two kids, but I am SO happy we did. Everyone was very welcoming. We rented a lovely private room that was extremely clean and cleaned periodically through our vacation. Laundry was available which is essential for a beach vacation with children. During Tropical Storm Ernesto, Tyrone stayed the night at the hostel to ensure everyone was safe and comfortable. Every staff member stepped up to make sure the generator was running until power returned. They were super helpful with restaurant and tour recommendations. My son, especially loved his surf lesson they offered! We also enjoyed kayaking/paddle boarding down the adjacent river. Casa Coral is staffed by people that begin to feel like friends and family. From daily chats, to cooking mofongo, to eating delicious papaya and guava con queso pastries!  It provides an opportunity to connect and explore with people from around the world. My little one is a wild one, but we felt at home every step of the way. Highly recommend!; This place is the Puerto Rican experience you need! The workers are so friendly, the rooms are good and the bathrooms are spectacular. The amenities are amazing for cooking, chilling…
A MUST here is rent a paddle board and go down the river! This was one of the highlights of our trips.
Thanks Derrick for the recommendations too; Amazing in every aspect.
Beautiful location in front of the beach.
Cute private room with super comfortable bed and great AC unit.
Super nice living area with plenty of appliances able to use, fridge/stove/air fryer.
Beach towels given to use, paddleboard / surfboard to rent.

Plenty of great places to eat and drink nearby too!

I love late afternoon walks along the quiet shore.; A Beautiful, bright orange stretch of sand makes for a very nice beach for walking and relaxing. The waves are amazing and many people were swimming when the seas weren't too rough. This beach has amazingly soft sands, and is nice and wide, a great spot to relax!"

They get busy so beating the crowd is important.; We bought a couple of apple pastries, a guava pastry, tres leches, and a guava roll with powdered sugar.

It was exactly what I had in mind when I thought of a tropical hotel. The room was clean and comfortable and the staff was very friendly.  It was my first time in Puerto Rico, and I plan on going back the next  chance I get. I will definitely stay at the Luquillo Sunrise Beach Inn again.; Loved that I had a beautiful view of the beach. The room was comfortable, and the bed was okay, but not the softest. The service was great. This is a perfect location if you want to get away from the hustle of San Juan and fewer tourists. The attached hotel is great!; I was pleased with my 4-night stay @ Luquillo Sunrise Inn. There are a number of things that I liked about it. It's nice to hear the sound of the ocean from your balcony at night, & to see the beautiful beach sunrise (hence the name.) It feels safe, and the location is a great hub to venture out and explore the beautiful region, or simply enjoy the beach RIGHT THERE, just just a few feet across a narrow street on the seaboard.

The staff was very helpful and friendly, and it is nice that they do offer beach towels, chairs, coffee, & have an on-site ice machine.  I've been to other places that don't offer these essential items, and those are additional costs that you will incur.

I like to have my provisions and own food, and loved having the Amigo Mart very nearby. This is a ""real grocery store"" that has everything you might need (including adult beverages; beer, wine, liquor) and it is reasonably priced.

Luquillo Sunrise Inn is not some fancy-schmancy bougie resort, but that was not what we were looking, or paying for. Some people may have unlimited funds, and don't really care what things cost, but for those of us who want to have a fun vacation on a reasonable budget at a nice safe place, Luquillo Sunrise Inn deserves two thumbs up, and I recommend it. I am looking forward to coming back.; Very nice hotel to stay. The beach is across the street . It's a very nice place to stay if you want to scape from the daily rush. You will find a lot of places nearby to eat and stay cool.I don't care what other people say. For me is an A+; Perfect location, view, proximity to beaches and walking distance to restaurants. Staff are amazing, especially Dianna. We loved our stay there. The photos are from our balcony. Highly recommend."

This is not my first time to Culebra or Culebrita but this is the BEST things to do in Puerto Rico. PERIOD!

Let's say I am an avid traveler and planner but this experience was 8 STARS our of 5 stars for me. So off the chart AMAZING!

My boyfriend and I wanted to do a date in Culebra but we did not expect this level or service and hospitality. Can not be found anywhere else in Puerto Rico (trust me, I looked & tried). Captain Camillo and first mate Danny was such incredible host that we thought we were on our honeymoon (seriously, tooo romantic).

HOW IT WORK:
1. Pre-trip communication was surprisingly detailed and prompt. Will help you with how to get to Culebra. I.E. Ferry tickets. Very accommodating on start time. Camillo gave us great recommendation where I wanted to visit.
2. TRANSPORTATION IS NOT INCLUDED but Camillo went out of his way and picked us up from the airport since we didn't rent a golf-cart so we were very grateful for his kindness. Please don't expect transportation because of this review.
3. Meet up point was in a central area. Easy to find. Right next to the restaurant El Navegante. Have dinner there after your trip.
4. The crew greeted us with a plate of fresh fruits, cheese, and deli meat. So luxurious~
5. Took a short ride to Playa Tortuga in Culebrita where the water was so clear like swimming in a pool. Brought out the Bose speaker to set the mood.
6. We started to float in the water while the crew set up the beach chairs and umbrella for us. They brought the cheese plate, Bose speakers, drinks, and our phones via Kayak to the beach for us! That was so wonderful because last time we had to do it ourselves via Water Taxi. We felt so spoiled.
7. FRESH & HOT lunch! They grilled delicious shrimp and chicken on the boat for us. Paired with an amazing gourmet salad and asparagus. Don't forget to take pictures because it was so romantic. (last time I went on a Catamaran to Culebra, they gave us cold sandwiches) Probably the best meal I had in Culebra.
8. Camillo took us on a adventure via kayak that's included on our trip to the water pool near by. (I had to pay for a snorkeling tour separated last time so this was a definitely worth the money to book with Sea Culebra). Camillo took us on a snorkeling tour and we got to swim with turtles and saw a stingray. We both can't swim but with a life vest, Camillo gave us the confidence to explore these beautiful water.
9. Also included water a SUP board, floaties, kayaks, snorkeling gears and anything you'll need to lounge or exploring. And we LOUNGED!

We will NEVER come back to Culebrita without booking with Sea Culebra again because it cost more and took a lot of time to logistically plan all the activities you should be doing in Culebra. Despite the unforgettable memories we made in Culebrita, we made friends with the crew that made the experience more memorable.

BEST MOMENTS:
1. Made friends with crew
2. Greeted us with fruit platter
3. Fresh, hot lunch
4. Set up camp for us with everything we need (Bose speaker, beach chairs, snacks, drinks, phones, sunscreens, towels, floaties). We literally didn't lift a finger.
5. Included snorkeling and kayak adventure tours lead by Camillo.
6. The passion and love of nature from the crew made us fell in love with Culebrita
7. Allowed us to have quality time with each other

I found them on TripAdvisor but directly booking with them will help small businesses! #smallbusiness; We did a six hour charter with Camilo, and it was fantastic!  He took us to Culebrita, which was gorgeous.  We snorkeled, and kayaked around this beautiful, calm bay.  Camilo set up chairs for us on our own private strip of beach, and then cooked us the best meal we’ve had on Culebra - grilled chicken and shrimp, corn and asparagus, and a delightful and fresh salad.  He is a delightful guy, and great source of info about life on Culebra.  His boat is super comfortable and perfect for day trips  like this.  Highest recommendation!; Captain Camillo and Nester were so cool! The vibe was laid back as we enjoyed one of the most beautiful beaches in the world on Culebrita... for hours my family snorkeled with dozens of turtles and fish... Camillo and Nester even built sandcastles with my 3 year old... Nester is a hell of a cook as well grilled up some burgers chicken and the shrimp was delicious! The boat had the music going while i laid out enjoying the hammock my wife and friends enjoyed their adult beverages ... we all did jumps of the boat into the crystal clear water! Booking process was easy... paypal Camillo a deposit and paid the rest in person and had one of the best days of my life! Thanks so much guys!!!; Words can't describe how beautiful the island of Culebra truly is, it's definitely worth the hype 🥰🌅; "

But very quiet, peaceful and private.; Needs some love the place has no pool its been out of service for more than a year . The photos are old it's not in that condition; The road to get to the “resort” is a disaster. It takes forever trying to get to the place because of the number of gaps in the road. 4x4 vehicle required. Although the place at first glance or impression seems spectacular, you find the situation that there is no staff. The green areas are well maintained, but the physical facilities are abandoned. (Especially the reception. There was a swarm of bees on the lobby furniture). You are welcomed upon arrival by countless cats, roosters, chickens, chicks, iguanas, peacocks and even seagulls (if a zoo). The pool is closed until 11:00am. When they start cleaning it, the few maintenance personnel there are. Too bad, it's not what's in the promotional photos.; Costa Bonita in Culebra, PR, is a very beautiful and quiet place.

They won’t even come tell you why they won’t let you in. Yes there are signs on the doors but  every business where we live has mask signs on their doors from the 2019 Covid pandemic but the ones where we live have moved on and no longer actually require masks. Someone left the store and we tried to enter but the woman working was extremely rude and would only permit one of us to enter. Just really cross and rude, bad communication. They don’t want your money at this business especially if you aren’t a local. We love spending money at local shops and will go get our hundreds of dollars of groceries elsewhere!; The owner of this store is not what some people think she is. She is a HUMAN being like everyone on here and is trying her best to bring income to take care of her family. SHOW some respect, and please understand her guidelines. Her first language is Spanish, NOT English. Some people are so very narrow-minded still. Take the blank in your stupid eyes. Wake up, foolish people. She is doing her best to run the business that was given by her father. I 1000% support her and her family business. Stop being ignorant and show some respect, plus understanding of her guidelines. Not everyone is feeling safe after the pandemic.; The female owner is super grumpy and should not be working with the general public. She is burnt.

They don’t care about your business.

Perhaps they are better to the locals.

* must wear a mask but they will sell you a highly over priced disposable mask for $1.00 and one customer per group only.; I read the reviews before coming here just as others have mentioned.
Brought a mask with me and was pleasantly greeted upon entry. Large, well laid out store with a good island variety. Really appreciated all of the items prices being marked. Paid by card. No issues. Pleasant transaction. I feel sorry for some of the feedback from people who are too proud to respect the owners' guidelines.; I read the reviews before going to this grocery (to where I have gone during my 4 vacation visits of years past).  I brought and wore my mask and used the hand sanitizer just inside the door and got the groceries (good selection, prices marked, and take credit cards) I needed today. I was treated respectfully, just like in any other store. I noticed an elderly person seated behind the counter with a walker near the younger lady (perhaps a family member) checking out my groceries. Maybe they are doing everything they can to help keep her healthy/safe? In my opinion it's their right (store owner's) to ask that customers wear a mask and sanitize their hands. I will be returning here."

My problem though was with the service, I felt the other people were not very welcoming and giving us dirty looks simply because of the way we looked. We both felt very uncomfortable and unfairly treated. One of the waitresses served everybody else in our general area except us on several occasions, she eventually did come one time but only with a cold shoulder and no manners. I don’t want to go back again and too expensive for getting shunned by the staff and the clubbers.; They're never open. I first came on a Wednesday night with my girlfriend around 830 and said they didn't open until 9 even tho it shows 8 on Google but they let me in anyway. Had a great time. Good music, good atmosphere. Have tried to go again at least 3 times and every time I go they are closed.

Response to Watra: fair enough. It was a good time but I've been on those days and hours and has been closed. Please update your hours on Google to reflect days and hours you are actually open; This place is lacking good music, and good drinks.
I would not recommend it to anyone.; I was invited to a Southwest airlines event from a friend to watch the bears game, so the bar was open outside of his normal operating hours. The food was catered which is why I have no stars selected for food, however, the bartenders were good at the way they prepare drinks and the atmosphere is very nice! I really love the large dance floor area that they have for those who may not be into sports. I believe they need a couple more TVs for events and this would be a great go-to spot at any time. Parking is limited around the club so be prepared to walk at least a half a block.; The space has the typical flashy lights, small stage, dance floor that can accommodate maybe 50 people or so with the furniture in place and the VIP area that is a mixture of everyone. Went for a birthday party and it wasn’t crowded when we arrived close to 11pm, the music selection was versatile from Too Short to Beyoncé but it still missed the mark somewhere at the beginning but once the DJ was on scene it was better. Interesting and confident crowd, this is a dress comfortably not dress to impress type of establishment."

It's practically empty, with a very large beach in either direction to lounge on. In my opinion, the water was clearer than Flamenco. The waves were not as strong, at least on the day I visited. If you go approximately 50 yards to the left from entrance after parking, you'll find the best area to go out with no rocks to maneuver around and you can walk out pretty far. I regret not bringing snorkel equipment as this is the ideal place to go.

The only drawback was the sand was mixed with some black stone, which caused it to get VERY hot and you couldn't stand barefoot in one area long, so either get in a shady spot, on a towel, or stay in the water!

We went back the next morning for sunrise as it faces to the east. Highly recommend!; Really beautiful and isolated beach, without many tourists.
Please keep in mind that the beach is not organized and there are no bathrooms or any places close to have food/drinks. There are also lots of sharp rocks, but there are clear spots to swim.; One of the most beautiful beaches I've seen. Calm waters, different hues of emerald green and turquoise and shallow for 60 feet. I liked this beach more than Flamenco because it was only a.fee people; Here is the BEST review: Once you get out of parking, you will encounter the palm tree. If you go to the right, you will find the most calm area as you approximate the end of the beach. You will find fishes, rocks and ecosystems. Cons: you will go in the water and find rocks almost everywhere, expect to get bruises. BUT if you go left from the palm tree, you will find more pure water, no rocks , water is less calm, you can expect even turtle’s nests and even deer accessing the beach when there is no people. If you like more adventure, Go LEFT!! More waves too and fun. Expect walking at lest 30ft going left from the tree.; Absolutely my favorite beach in the world! Stunning landscape! Very few people, zero resorts, free to enjoy, only palm trees and water on this beach.  Gahhh, i will dream about this place until i see it again."

In the first place, two days before the activity they called us to say that it is not allowed to place inflatables, when the reservation was made they told us that it was possible and they wanted us charge an additional $120, thank God we had the evidence in the messages. The day before we went to look for the keys and make the payment, they never gave us the keys to the main gate and they told us that the next day in the morning they would give us a code, We spent more than an hour waiting outside with all the decoration things for our calls and messages to be answered and no one ever answered us. We had to write to all the guests to delay the time of the activity. A neighbor helped us contact the owner and so we were able to enter, the kitchen was locked and another person had to come to bring them. The following hours they called us that we had not paid, when the day before we went to their office personally, they are too disorganized, not responsible at all, nothing professional.

Rented a Jeep for the day, shuttle was waiting at the ferry terminal when I arrived. Only the driver is allowed on the shuttle to the rental place. Was in and out in about 30 minutes or so due to a line. Car I had was nice and new. I dropped off my car later on in the day so they were closed but dropping it off after hours is super easy. Had to walk back to the ferry terminal, not a bad walk and quite pleasant. Would recommend and would book again.

Keep in mind that the gas station closes pretty early, or at least it did in my case. So if you rent a vehicle and don’t want to pay for the rental company to fill it up or don’t want to run out of gas and get stuck somewhere, I suggest going early in the day before they close. I think this information should’ve been disclosed.; Great rental company giving it 4 instead of 5 because of the trouble I had with the golf cart. The guys going over the cars are super nice. My first golf cart was smoking/burning and had to return same day. Super nice and switched it out. I decided to stay another day. It rained pretty bad the golf cart just died in the middle of the road because the engine got wet. Luckily their ferry shuttle was right behind me and help move it. Super nice gentlemen, he told me to call him if it didn't turn on. I finally did but there was a beeping noise. I went back to the rental company. Just done with the cart. The nice young lady reassured me that when get wet it makes that sound until it dries. I build up the confidence to drive it back to my hotel. Next time I know to just rent a Jeep especially if your staying more then one day.; Amazing rent a cart,helpful,friendly staff,l wish in the future carlos rent a cart offer half day option .l don’t think is fear that my friend rent a golf cart for a whole day and pay $68 and l rent same cart for 6 hours and l pay same amount, of money in the future hopefully that change .; This was a great experience but I want to add a special thank you to their staff as I had left my wallet in one of their jeeps. I had to take a ferry back to get it but they retrieved it and had it ready for me to pick up with everything still in it! You guys are fabulous! Praying the Lord’s blessing over you all ♥️; Great people, great brand new jeeps, highly highly recommend if youre doing anything more than a day trip."

Had a blast for my sister's 30th bday, v.i.p section ❤️; Really good, DJ, so you can dance in your seat. There is no dance floor. The place is overcrowded with chairs and tables so ppl dance between the tables, they dance at the bars, anywhere they can find space. I've never seen anything like this. I had a few patron and pineapple drinks, and there is no way that was actually Patron. I had a headache for 24 hours. Upscale prices for drinks, not an upscale establishment. The bartender, who looked like a manager because of her clothing, ate at the bar the whole time in front of everyone. She ate chips out of a cup and licked her fingers, then served drinks without washing her hands. She also had a plate of food while bartending. Very unprofessional. I didn't realize they served food until I saw the bartender eating  because no one offered us a menu.; On September 17, 2017 my best friend fell to her death outside of this club after being overserved. May she rest in peace 💔; Security was great, that's bout it for me. First it was $40 after 11pm to get in👎🏾, then $11 for a vodka and cranberry in what I believe was an 6-8oz cup👎🏾 and then soooo many tables that you had no space to dance, move, even to take pics. I'm not sure if it was just the timing but they don't allow you out to smoke and re-enter.; I asked for my bill and I paid with a credit card and they brought me a different receipt with a 15% charge for paying with a credit card, and they did not warn you before. They are literally stealing."

We found Colmado Milka via Yelp and decided to give them a try. From our anchorage just offshore, we were able to dinghy to a dock located just 20 yards from the front door of the store. We were there via boat, but it was obvious from the customers in the store that there were many locals as well as tourists staying on the island shopping there.

Colmado Milka is probably one of the best stocked stores in the Virgin Islands. It's not big, but the selection and variety were incredible. Everything we needed was available. The store has a well-stocked beer and liquor section too! There is also a meat department in the back. Check out was easy too, they take credit cards... the hardest part of the shopping trip was hauling everything back to the dinghy. It took three trips on the dinghy to get all the supplies and personnel back to the catamaran.

Colmado Milka was a great find on this trip. Recommend the store whether you find yourself on Culebra by boat or airplane. The store will likely have everything you need.; Nice supermarket which is bigger than expected once you are inside. Prices are a little higher than main land but it cost money to drag all these goods over to the island. I stayed at this great hotel Posada La Hamaca next to the bridge so this super market was a minute walk away to getting waters, chips, juice etc before and after the beach.; A very well stocked general store with good quality fresh produce at decent prices. There is a dinghy dock around the back.
2 large fresh chicken breast $5.40, 1lb of good quality ground beef $5.67, large box of fresh Spinach $5.90
Also has a good selection of diy hardware items.; Whatever you need, they probably have it. Best place to get meat on the island. Nothing has prices on it which is really annoying, but there is a price scanner in the middle of the chaotic shop that you can scan items on.; Wow...wow. From outside looks very small but once inside is big and have a lot of things. The people were also very attentive and prices are not to bad."

The owner and host, Juan, was super nice and gave us all the information we needed prior our arrival. The house is a little outdated but had everything we needed and just steps away from one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. There were beach chairs and umbrellas available at the house we could use. We were a bit away from the public beach entrance—where they also sell food—so it was never crowded and felt like we had the beach all to ourselves. We did snorkeling near the rocks and saw plenty of fish. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back!; I cannot speak highly enough of the owners, Juan and Violeta. They are so warm and welcoming. We ran into an unfortunate emergency, and they were quick to assist and even supplied some extra items when we had to make an unplanned trip to San Juan. Juan checked in multiple times during the situation to see how we were doing. They went above and beyond what was required simply out of the goodness of their hearts.

The location of this place is incredible. Having one of the most beautiful beaches on your doorstep is impossible to beat. The rooms are simple but comfortable and clean, especially when you'll want to spend most of your days on Flamenco Beach. We already are dreaming about the day when we'll get to go back.; Our stay here in culebra was one of the highlights of our 9 days in Puerto Rico. They have amazingly well kept grounds right on the world famous flamenco beach. The villa itself was clean, spacious, had plenty of kitchen supplies and it was very comfortable. The owners are super friendly and want to ensure everyone here has a great experience. We can’t wait to come back!; I highly recommend this place!!!

Fabulous experience, truly a place to disconnect and undwaind. FANTASTIC BEACH!!!

Violeta and Juan are very kind and friendly.

I can't wait to go back...; Cozy and privately beach front setting. Perfect for couples wanting quality time."

Definitely don’t come with sneakers, or jeans. We got lucky on a Friday night and they let us in... dance floor was fun and full of people dancing. Coat check was 3$ and mandatory so bring some cash.

I’ve participated in one of their Mojitos tasting which pleasantly delivered. Cool and hip staff. Safely secured spot. Street metered parking and near by parking garages; The bartenders are clueless, bored-looking, and unprofessional. First bartender charged me $10 for a single shot of Tito's using a Quick Charge (not POS buttons). 2nd bartender did not know how to make a cake shot, and then charged $9 for it. I asked the 2nd how much a shot of Tito's was to confirm my first charge and he shrugged. Bartender did not know what Disaronno was, had to explain to him it was a type of amaretto, which he then had to look for by name with a phone flashlight. Heard another patron ask for a Bacardi and Coke, bartender said they didn't have Bacardi. Other guest literally pointed to the bottle of Bacardi sitting in plain view. If you're going to be totally clueless at least be friendly, but they weren't. Apathetic at best, annoyed & rude at worst. Bruh.; I bought two shots and got charged $20.40. The bartender was rude to us and we spent 25$ to get in for the event that was going on. We left after that because I asked how much a vodka red bull was and they said 10$, then how did I spend 10$ a piece on just a shot of vodka.

We left and went to a bar down the road with 1$ shots.; Unfortunately I cannot leave 0 stars. I went out with my wife, who happens to be African American, and her cousins, also African American. There wasn't a cover for anyone else in front of us. But when we got to the front, apparently they started charging a cover fee. Pretty convenient since no one in front of us had to pay to get in. The people in front of us that got in were not African American. Do not support this business!"

We called on the ferry on our way to Culebra and reserved our golf cart. Once we got off the boat they were there to receive us and drove us to their location. When we were finished. One of the lovely ladies rushed us in their golf cart to make sure we made the ferry back to the main island! From start to finish this company was great to spend our money with. Will use again in the future. Thanks again for getting my friend and I back to the ferry right on time before they left!; Would NEVER recommend this rental car place to anyone. We rented this Ford Bronco, and paid $126 for a day, even though we stayed in Vieques for 5 hours, and returned it in that time frame. First of all, the Bronco had the check engine light on, the tires needed air, among other things (shown in picture); the outside of the car it had missing pieces ( shown in photo) and most importantly whenever the car had to be put in reverse or turn it sounded like it was going to break in half. Here comes the fun part, when we returned the car, at first everything was ok, but then comes out the first girl to “check it”…of course we acknowledge that there was sand in the car (it was a beach day), but she said that the sand didn’t matter, then she proceded to “touch” the seats, looked at us and said “they are humid” “we are going to charge you for this” … then she went inside the place to ask the other girl/clerk how much they were going to charge us for this. The second girl, while talking on the phone, answered us screaming, with an attitude, mentioning about the contract we signed, and how they were going to charge us an additional $50. We obviously left the place, without saying anything else to her, and surprise surprise, right after we received the email of them charging us a “cleaning fee”. We are locals, puertoricans, helping other puertoricas with their business, but they will NOT be getting us another time!!!; Easy rental process and a great UTV! We had tons of fun visiting Flamenco Beach and had no issues with the vehicle. We were able to drop it back after hours and they shuttled us back since the staff were closing when we left. Great experience, we’d use this company again! Note that you can get a ride from the ferry - look for their logo. That would have saved us a hot walk if we’d known!; Fast service and friendly staff! Their golf carts were very comfortable, stylish, and new. Rented one with speakers, which made the trip around the island even better. Truly a must have if you want to enjoy the scenic views around Culebra to the maximum!; Had a reservation for a month with the understanding that someone would meet us at pier for the after hours ferry. Everything was already paid for. Not only was there no golf cart at the pier but we took a taxi ride to the rental shop.  there were multiple carts outside but none were ours.  Went back the next day and the lady running the place was extremely rude to us and she took no fault in the mix up. She said I did not answer the phone to confirm my reservation. Therefore they did not feel the need to leave the rental available.   Once we did get the Cart it was the jankiest,  most tore up cart I'd ever seen.  Seriously, go elsewhere."

Breakfast was really good and the service is pretty quick. My boyfriend really enjoyed the open bar even with a limited selection.

Unfortunately, they did not have carrucho to offer at the time, and upon peaking at the qr menu prices... we hightailed it out of there😅.

Looked like a cool place with nice views but even on easter week it was pretty empty. I found the menu a bit limited and prices high.

Only open fri-sun from what it showed. Maybe next time.; I visited this place back in 2020; and it was very good. I went it today and it hasn’t changed. It seems to be owned by a guy from the US which he even clean our table and was very kindness. The host was very helpful ( sorry I forgot your name). Beers very cold; but What I want to recommend is the food. Please try the “Gouda Cheese Potizers” ( Croquetas de Queso Gouda). Those are out of this world with the Mayo-Ketchup sauce. The wings are big, juicy and delicious try it with the fried plantain sticks with the house chimichurri. You won’t be disappointed! The place, bathrooms and parking, clean. The Atlantic Ocean view…incredible. Also no lousy music or bad smell like the Piñones places.; A good Stop and go bar.

This place has a great view, beach side and good location.

Food selection is very limited. Only fried food, ceviche and ribs. This is a great place to have a couple of drinks an appitizer and leave. Also the food is a bit overpriced compared to other restaurants in the area.

Overall  4.1 out of 5; THE BEST!  It has everything - great food (we tried a sampler of all kinds of things), fabulous drinks (mojitos and vodka soursops were incredible!), and amazing views!!!"

The equipment is broke, rusted and dated. Half the treadmills never work.
Crossfit is okay, a bit difficult to convey what im trying to get out the class being i dont speak Spanish, but the female instructor is very nice and tries to work with me.
This gym is okay, at least they have free weights to work with and the benefit of crossfit is that you are able to attend the gym without additional cost.; I recomed this gym because the personnel is very professional and they take care of their class while making excersices. Bathrooms are nice and perfect spaces with lickers. Also the price is write! Also, for moms is a -MOST- cause they have a Person to take care of your kids while you are taking your time.
Love all the classes like: spinning, X-co, Zumba, Salsa cardio,  etc.

There are some machines that needs care."

If you are anywhere in the East Coast in Puerto Rico you gotta stop at Palmas Del Mar and visit Norberto’s; Great & romantic place  ♡♡ , Beautiful set up (almost like Scarface)Nice to have a couple of drinks, and enjoy life music on Fridays and Saturdays 8:30 -10:30 p.m. They have happy hours on Sundays and  brunch with reservations.  Also, for residents  of Palmas, they have transportation available (pick-up and drop off *on golf cart); The Sunday afternoon tea was incredible! The tower of delights was just that - delightful. The top tier had assorted treats, and we were given several options for the scone and sandwich tiers. In addition to the tea, we also ordered mimosas. The delicious food and drinks would have been enough, but the owners went above and beyond to create magical experience. I can't recommend this place enough!; Norberto’s is a much needed addition to Palmanova. A place where you can go & dine & enjoy great food & amazing cocktails or just have an after dinner drink. The host & staff are professional and attentive. The owners are hands on with obvious experience in operations. Offering a wide array of great cuisine & cocktails, you won’t be disappointed with their choice of ambiance thru their eclectic furnishings and diverse music. They are warm & welcoming & hope to offer you a place to kick back, enjoy the place & each other in a relaxed atmosphere. Ivd visited more than once and will certainly visit again. With open mic Thursdays, fine piano on Weekends and considering “Salsa Sundays” it’s a place you simply have to check out. I would describe Norberto’s as “a touch of class”….you be the judge 🥰‼️; I’ve been here multiple times over the past few months and each time have had a wonderful experience! The staff are so friendly and the food and cocktails are delicious. With trivia nights, karaoke and music, the atmosphere is always so enjoyable. Such a fabulous addition to Palmas and the plaza!!

Sadly the food is not. The only thing worth ordering is the mofongo. The grilled calamari was rubbery and the Mahi Mahi bites were over so overbreaded and over fried we couldn’t even taste the fish. The side of veggies was okay and the chocolate cake was very good. The Bloody Mary was just fresh tomato juice and vodka 😅..; Tapas at The Pool Club offers an exceptional dining experience with a unique fusion of French and Puerto Rican cuisine.

Their paella is outstanding and a must-try.

The staff, especially Elisabeth, are friendly and welcoming. A five-star experience for anyone looking for culinary creativity and great service.

Simple, casual, you will not be disappointed.; Beautiful ocean view &access!!
Good burgers and chicken wings 😋  Excellent flavors
Good service!!; Service with slow, it's a very small restaurant. Not more than 50 people, they can't handle the capacity. The food that I ordered especially the steak. When I asked well done, it came pink and bloody absolutely disgusting. The worker's try to help as much as possible. The manager is an a******. Overall disliked; This restaurant is not allowing people to eat there or order take out because they want everyone to show proof of vaccination according to “Puerto Rican COVID guidelines” which is no where in any mandate by the government. I was told to show proof of vaccination when I wanted to order and I told the lady I was ordering to go and I was given attitude as she told me in Spanish “it doesn’t matter I still want your vaccine certification”. Which according to this restaurant guidelines which they sent out a notice that they will not serve any unvaccinated individuals for dine in according to the PR government guidelines which is a lie, and now the employees have taken it upon themselves to not serve anyone wether they’re eating in or taking out if they’re not vaccinated which is against what was sent in a memo from the restaurant themselves and ALSO not in line with government mandates or recommendations. So if you don’t want to serve me due to YOUR OWN wishes then so be it, but give me attitude because I told you I was eating out and I do not need a vaccine certification for that according to your own rules is a different story and definitely don’t tell me you’re following government guidelines because you’re also lying. That is absolutely horrible service. Enjoy losing a regular costumer."

I have played several courses in PR and this club is by far my favorite!! Didn't get to play the Flamboyan course yet but the Palms course was absolutely beautiful!! The course is so well taken care of. Fairways and greens were in immaculate shape. The Palm side is the first course they built and is not as challenging as Flamboyan. However for the average golfer, I feel this course is perfect. Plenty of wide fairways with beautiful rolling hills, surrounded by absolutely beautiful scenery. There is plenty of challenges that make your round so much fun. It has its share of big fairway and greenside bunkers as well as some beautiful, long, dog-leg par 5s. There are just the right amount of water hazards too. The property is absolutely stunning and very well maintained. The pro shop staff, the cart staff, and the rangers were all assets to this country club! All were friendly, courteous, and informative. They looked after our every need and made our visit that much more enjoyable. It's the little things that make a big difference in customer service and here they hit all the point and think of everything.
Can't wait to come back and hopefully it will be a longer stay next time. If you are looking for a top notch country club and a beautiful golf course while you are in PR then try Palmas Athletic Club, you will not be disappointed!; Palmas Athletic Club is a nice facility to enjoy lounging near the pool or grabbing a meal.; It is definitely the best Golf Course of Puerto Rico! Service and Food is Paramount to them!; The new golf pro is highly unprofessional. I have been a member of the Palmas Athletic Club for over four years and have been going to the golf club hitting range every Sunday. I was just now informed that golf clubs will no longer be lent out because others were supposedly using them in an unruly fashion. This decision was made solely by this new pro and I do not understand why the actions of a few can prevent me, a years-long member that has paid over $5,000 and counting to this organization, from using golf clubs at the hitting range.; It's a good solid course that's $150 before 1pm and $90 for twilight if you're staying at a local resort. That also includes range balls and a gps cart.

The guys at the cart barn and the woman in the pro shop were super cool and your name will be listed on your cart.

As for the course; the greens were super quick and I had to putt a 15 footer like it was 8-10 feet.  And although the greens were smooth they weren't lush and spongy but rather dry and slick.  It's like they needed to be over seeded. Take time on the practice green to get the speed.  Also the ball doesn't rip back on wedge shots but will check up while chipping around the greens.

Playing from the tips (Flamboyan course) you'll need at least a 250 yard carry, but if a slice is your miss I suggest you move up a tee box because going right is no bueno on 3,5,6,7,10, 11, 14 and 18.

Would I play it again? Absolutely! Nice views, friendly people and it's not an overly difficult golf course as long as you don't go way right."

It's pretty decent. The worst part is that if you are a visitor to another club they charge you $20 to shoot at this club for a single day. $20! In addition to that, I asked if they had memberships of less than a year and they said no. And a one-year membership costs $90. This shooting club is a big no for me. They never see me again.; Every time I went to practice it was luck and truth when the supposed federals were there and they were companies of security guards, a lie that only the administrator believed 🤦‍♂️ and the days of the use and driving classes also limit the courts and You can't use space or rifles, that's why I'm no longer a member."

Atmosphere is great if you love to be outdoors; Service was terrible by server Kristal L. We arrived and the bartender told us to have a seat and a server would be with us.  15+ minutes later we asked the bartender if we should give him our order, so he took it.  I ordered a gluten free pizza (and said the GF part twice).  Then 5 minutes later Kristal came over and took the order again.  We again said the Gluten Free part twice and also ordered fries.  The food took forever (note: there were 6 other people here and didn't look like they were eating anyway).  The food arrived and we had no napkins, silverware, plates etc.  She dropped off the food and that was it.  Every visit back to us took a long time and we wouldn't receive everything we asked for.  She would completely disappear unless I asked the bartender for her.  The pizza took a long time to cool and when it finally did, I took a bite and realized it was NOT gluten free (mind you we had now stated this 4 times).  Since Kristal never came to check on us I asked the bartender for her.  She came and I said ""this doesn't look GF"" and she said ""oh it's not"".  Good Lord, another 30 minutes later we got the correct pizza and left.; Mr. Jose Navarro is wonderful! He is provides great service! Highly recommend!; Great place to grab a drink poolside. It is resort style pool menu along with prices. They do make fresh brick oven pizzas and smelled great. Will have to try. There is music and also a DJ on certain days. The area has plenty of seating areas around the pool and also swim up bar. Tables are available along with lounge chair.  Showers and bathrooms are nearby.  There is also some hammocks to enjoy.

If you are in Humaco GO HERE!!; The service is very slow so keep that in mind before you go because they are short staffed.
But overall we had the best night at this restaurant. Good food (I had the burrito and it was huge and good). The owner Johnathan loves people and loves his job and it’s so evident through this place. We kareoked all night and we will definitely be back. One of our funnest nights so far!; I came to PR for the first time and this was the best place and experience on the island. The best food was served but most importantly the customer service was the best of the best. You truly will not find a better experience and I highly recommend everyone giving it a shot.

Don’t go to PR without getting to El Zocalo.; While visiting Puerto Rico for the first time, this was a hidden gem.  Great food and music.  Awesome atmosphere.  Did I mention the food?!

However when I arrived at check in time I was told to wait for a room waited about 2 hours for a room when I arrived to the room given it was still being cleaned went back told the guy and he apologized and held are bags in the back for us so we could explore around and when we came back to get our room he gave us free meal vouchers and told me he would be giving me 5,000 points to my account. I stayed at this property on 07/28/2024-07/29/2024 I still have not received the points promised and have tried calling the property and they never respond.; The place is really beautiful. Staying here will really put you in the beach/tropical vacation mood. The lobby has smoothing and jazzy music to make a really calm atmosphere. The ballrooms are spectacular. My church hosted an event here in which we were able to have 700 people. The bathrooms are SO nice and clean. I love this hotel; I really enjoyed my nine nights here! The pools are amazing, the rooms are modern, and the staff was superb!!  Carlos and Shirley at the front desk were very helpful. Kayla at the pool was a gem, and Jayson Santos, the general service manager, went above and beyond. The staff really made the stay exceptional.; The hotel's proximity to the beach and the quality of the pools were highlights of my stay.

However, I would like to share some feedback regarding a few aspects that did not meet my expectations. As a Diamond member, I excepted a better treatment, at the very least, a room in better condition. Unfortunately, the phone in my room was non-functional, and both the bathtub and sink lacked drain protection. Additionally, there were no water bottles provided in the room, requiring us to refill them in an area that was not well-maintained and had an unpleasant odor. The towels also appeared to be overused, as their texture was not as soft as I would have expected. The balcony door didn’t lock properly, which left the room unsecured. Lastly, I was surprised by the parking fee of $15 per night, which I may have overlooked on the website.; Since the moment we got here it was desolate and there was no one to help or give any direction, when checking in we were told we would have to wait for our room since they have no systems working (whatever that means) after waiting we finally got the room and off we went with all of our luggage only to find that there are no elevators at this hotel and we got a room with a great view of the front entrance from our balcony. The room was extremely cold and after a long day I was looking forward to a hot bath but what I got was a bathtub that looks so old and dirty and that I can’t fill up, oh! And also there’s no hot water!!! After calling the front desk we were told that the water heater was not working and there was no estimate for it to be fixed and also some rooms have bathtubs you can fill but this one doesn’t so just deal with it. At that point I was already pissed and when I woke up next morning to find that there was still no hot water and that now I have to walk around with my card because they have no system and can’t charge anything to the room.

Edit: I changed it to 3 stars just because the staff and service were really good. The manager Jason reached out and went above and beyond to make our stay more comfortable, he was great. The system never worked during our stay though and water was never really hot just a bit warm, I’m not sure if that’s just as hot as the water gets or if it will be fixed. All in all the manager and staff along with the great pools managed to turn everything around for us. I will say the food was average and sometimes plain inedible and highly overpriced.  I will say in my opinion the issues are not due to the manager or staff and I believe is Wyndham who is responsible for how poorly their resorts perform and they have been going downhill for a year now, they clearly have no care for the people choosing to stay in their hotels."

No Sprite or 7up; Chicken Skewers were very tasty and not dry, the BBQ sauce was not very strong, if you order with pique be prepared because it is quite spicy but with a very good flavor. The natural juice of delicious passion fruit and acerola.

Chicken kabobs were delicious they were cooked perfectly, they have BBQ sauce but it did not overpower the chicken flavor. If you like spicy the hotsauce was really good, but it has a kick. The natural juices were just refreshing and delicious. We had the passion fruit and the acerola (Puertorican cherry); Good but not nice the mint leaves or the lemons other than normal"

Sliding doors to the balcony need your muscles to get them to open. Balcony view is stunning 😍
Pls fix this apartment. Exhaust fans at both bathrooms are breaking down too. You are pushing it when it comes to maintenance of this place

What drew us in was the small, independently run kitchen in the back and their $4 fish tacos, and let me tell you - they did not disappoint. We don't know what the chef used on them, but they were simply amazing - probably the best fish tacos we've ever had. They were simple, with just some salsa and lettuce on the fish, but the secret seasoning they used made all the difference. We're still talking about them! As for the bar itself, the service was good, prices were comparable, and there was a pool table in the back that seemed to stay busy.

Final Impressions
MojitoLab excels in delivering a top-tier cocktail experience. The innovative and expertly crafted drinks, coupled with a stylish setting and outstanding service, make it a standout choice for anyone looking to enjoy sophisticated cocktails in Luquillo. For a truly exceptional mixology experience, MojitoLab is the place to be.; Went to the kiosk that doesn’t serve food. Ordered the parcha and coconut mojito. EXTREMELY satisfying. I’m not a huge fan of coco, but the parcha was so refreshing. Definitely recommended stop.; So I just came here to return my drinks the next day because we got our drinks at closing,  we were walking to the car with my baby, so when we tried the drinks in the car it  was bad, we went to return it same day but they closed, so today we just explained how the drinks were not good, we didn’t drink it at all , we showed them the bag with the drinks, the manager did not care to understand at all, they actually made the drinks & asked me to pay again, after we said no to paying ,that’s 60 dollars, he rather throw the drinks in the garbage than having us take the drinks, guys don’t go here at all, the drinks are terrible & the good reviews must not know what good mojitos are, you’re going to spend a lot here for nasty drinks.; Great casual place to grab mojitos for the beach. A must visit whenever in Luquillo. I get the coco parcha and it hits every time, but you can combine any flavors you want. If you’re lucky they’ll give you a piece of candy with it. They have two sizes but beware - they’re strong!"

IMPORTANT
the only reason we were able to find the place is from another review.

Google maps will take you to a gated house that is behind the bar. Once you are a minute away from the google maps destination, you will see half of a basketball court with parking in front of it. Park here and talk to the beach and go to the left. You will then see the bar a couple buildings down.

Enjoy!; First off, this place is nearly impossible to find. If you’re going down the road that it’s on, they Our one house before the yellow house on the right at the end of the street. Easy way to get there, is somebody else’s pointed out in a prior review, park at the little little basketball court on your right, and walk down the beach. You’ll find it. But there’s no sign or anything.

That being said, My wife and I went there for lunch based on the reviews, which were outstanding. The reviews are spot on. The food is great, the drinks are absolutely incredible. Some of the best drinks we’ve had anywhere at any price.

We will definitely go back next time we’re in the area, I’m glad we found this place.; Absolutely amazing. This place is located in a secluded spot on the beach. We found it while walking one day and were impressed by the drinks-all the ingredients were fresh and the staff mixed some amazing concoctions. The food was also high-level. They make all the dishes from scratch and it shows! We also had the pleasure of meeting some horses while we visited. Absolutely wonderful!; This place is a true hidden gem!! The best service and great food. It’s a little difficult to find but if you’re driving, park at the blue basketball court 5 houses before and walk the beach. The staff were by far the friendliest we’ve met on any vacation."

It's like a liquor store/bar.  I really love the entire area.  This is a total locals place.  Met some way cool people there who were just hanging out enjoying themselves.

As I said, I can't stop coming back to Luquilo itself because of places like Chelo's, and the insanely beautiful beach & ocean right there of course.

We visited in March 2022 and admission was included in the hotel stay - no additional charges as some reviews below indicate.; This waterpark is part of the El Conquistador resort and included in your stay. Very nice waterpark with three very fun slides and several pools and a lazy river.

Less crowded than street-level spots, it's a picturesque escape. Note: No on-site parking, but a nearby public garage is available for $5. 🌆🍹; Good handout place to catch up for some drink and food.

Server / bar tender was on it. Great food! AMAZING drinks. Had the zombie. 10/10 recommend.; The cocktails are amazing. Our bartender Adrian recommended us really good drinks and made them very fast. This is one of the best bar set ups I have seen. You can see every type of alcohol they have available and I love that you can see all the inclusions they have in front of you. They have fun mini games in the bar you can enjoy. Nice music and very relax.; Came in to grab a drink before dinner and the restaurant was steadily busy. The bartender let us know that no tables or seats were available but let us know we could hangout at a ledge/ counter area. Once barstools became available though they so kindly brought them over to us. We enjoyed the mojito and rum old fashioned both were someone of the best cocktails we have ever had. We enjoyed one of the specials they had on feature chicken dumplings, they were so delicious. More then the amazing drinks and get app though is the staff! They are so kind and attentive. One of the bartenders Adrian even went out of her way to make us a list of her favorite places to check out. Highly recommend this establishment if visiting San Juan! Such a wonderful experience!; The food was alright, but not at all worth the wait. We had a reservation for 9p, ordered 4 tapas, and were not served after 10p (the last order was served at 10:20p). My first drink came quickly enough, and was okay, but I had to ask for my second drink three times, twice from the waitress, and once from the bartender (who ignored the request even though he was either not making other drinks or casually talking to other patrons); in general each time I approached them about the drink, it felt like the first time). It seems they were short staffed, which I’m usually sympathetic to, however if each time I ask for an update on my food or drinks, I’m not given even a faux apology for the wait, all sympathy is lost. I wanted to like this place for the vibe and location, but cannot recommend it in good faith.; Had a lackluster experience at a different restaurant across the street so we decided to give Kane’s a try.  Small menu and excellent rum selection with cocktails.  Had a wonderful salad with seared tuna and chicken dumplings.  The bartender even made me a daiquiri that wasn’t super sweet- just the way I like it!  Great small tapas bar….. with delightful staff- we’ll be back!"

But I was wrong. They didn't accept credit cards for the $10 cover at the front to enter the club, so I had to inconveniently walk to the ATM to get cash. I did like the DJ and music. The drinks were okay, but extremely overpriced. A single vodka cranberry drink was $10. I really think I was overcharged by the bartender, as I only ordered 2-3 drinks and a round of $1 Jello shots and my tab came out to be close to $50. The guests at the club were cliquey and stuck up. Both bathrooms were locked and occupied the entire time, and there were no urinals to use. I got so fed up after only spending about an hour at the club and just left. Wouldn't recommend and won't return.; Great space. Good drinks.  Totally blown away that they would have a full on family-fued style, long drag show with talking at 130am instead of music and dancing on a Friday night.

We ordered one drink and left.  So, so disappointing. Planned on staying and dancing til 3am.; Beware of purchasing advance tickets with this club for Rupaul Celebrity Guest Stars. They cancel events and don’t do refunds. Several times and zero luck. Don’t worth it. Be the judge with this two promos. SCAM!

Waiting for the person who replies this GMB say is lie! Because I had the screenshots of the request for refund on Eventbrite since the event was cancelled.; Scammers. They dont want to refund me two tickets because they said the event was not cancelled. My purchase was for Anetra and not AQUARIA. THIS MERCHANT HAS NOT SCRUPLES. I RECOMMEND TO AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST. PLUS DRINKS TASTE BAD TOO MUCH ALCOHOL/WATER DILUTED. I ONLY WENT FOR RUPAUL SHOWS BECAUSE THAT PLACE IS THE WORSG AND NOW IS 100% CONFIRMED- GO TO TOXIC NIGHTCLUB- They refund you if a event is cancelled.; For a place called Kweens Klub, this place didn’t much seem to care much for their drag queens, because neither the doorman nor the bartender would break up a $10 bill for 1’s, so be sure to bring your own dollar bills. The place had maybe two dozen people there for the Saturday night 1am drag show ($8 cover), and the “music” was blasted so loud during intermission, it had the effect (and sound) of an electromagnetic pulse, clearing the room. My expectations were modest after reading the reviews, and no surprises. Great lighting and space, staff was friendly enough, and the queens put on a helluva show — it’s just a shame the promoters couldn’t fill the place or keep people there."

We visited on a weekday, and although it was pretty slow, we had an amazing time. The drinks were delicious, and the bartenders were fantastic.

Definitely recommend checking it out!; This hidden gem is amazing. Fantastic cocktails. Appetizers to die for and amazing service. ! I'll definitely head back here on my next trip in !; I was disappointed by my interaction with the bartender when I asked them about the ingredients in my drink. I ordered a Gold Rush. The menu lists it with Bulleit Bourbon, lemon, and honey. The drink I received had a sour flavor — and not the kind of sour flavor you want to taste in your cocktail. I tried a few sips before I reluctantly brought the drink back to the bar and explained the lemon tasted off to me. The bartender let me know he used lime instead of lemon. He tasted it in front of me and said it tasted right to him. I showed him the menu where it said lemon instead of lime. I asked him to make an old fashioned instead and left the drink at the bar. When I got my check, they still charged me $15 for the Gold Rush they made incorrectly and that I didn’t drink. I was disappointed with the response. I would have left a positive review if they refunded the drink they made incorrectly or at least made the drink again with the correct ingredients. The old fashioned was good, and we liked the atmosphere. Just wish they handled customer service differently.; Awesome cocktails and bartenders. The vibes are incredible here. Super fresh rooftop with tables tucked away in nooks.; Went on a Saturday & it was a fun date spot. Nice breeze, fun music, comfy chairs, beautiful people. Server came as soon as we sat, but after we received our drinks we never saw him again."

The 3 bucks are not the issue if I gave the authority to tip, it is the principle of stealing monies via crediting my card more than the price of my drinks.

Then they have Leather Red Beds in what seems like the hallway for everyone to watch that are Free. The Drinks are reasonably priced and We paid with a Debit Card. They played Latin Music all night.

Pricey but worth every penny.; Excellent cocktails, with beautiful ambiance. Expensive but it is a 5 star hotel.

Update: years passed and I have revisited several times, the drinks are still stunning. Certainly some of the best cocktails I have had.; I went with two of my friends to the Father’s Day event. We had a great time. But, the highlight of the night was the greatest waitress ever, Veronica. I was having such a great time that I misplaced a very important object in a napkin, thinking I was going to remember to put it in my purse. ( Such a stupid idea) When we were out of the lounge, I remembered and looked back, but our table was already clean. With an embarrassed face I told our waitress. She did not hesitate to help me out. She put some gloves on and did not stop until she got both of the objects!!!! For ever will be grateful!!!!  If you go, ask for Veronica she’s really nice, positive and hard worker. ❤️; Go to the bar and let Anthony serve you! Its perfect! You’ll love it!; Veronica was the best server I’ve ever had. Professional, polite, knowledgeable on drinks and recommended the tastiest drinks. She also recommended good restaurants for us to visit while we were vacationing in Puerto Rico. I would never come to Condado Vanderbilt Hotel without her here. Great experience."

The employees are amazing with great charisma. Great coffee and El Jugo de China esta súper sabroso.; Small restaurant in Barranquitas. The restaurant seems that they do not have the adequate staff for influx of customers. Went with my wife on New Years Day as they were open. There were between 10-12 clients already seated. After they sat us, the employee indicated that due to the other clients just arrived, my order would take over 45 minutes. Wow….45 minutes. We asked for the time of coffee and the order would be serviced promptly. We decided to order the Cappuccino; which was delicious and decided to not wait for a breakfast order to be served.

Seems that Cafetalito is trying to emulate the Bistros located in the Metropolitan area, but are coming in short - location is small, cannot handle over 12 clients at the same time and from the plates I saw being serviced, they need to make them visually more attractive.; Just happened by this place while visiting expecting to quickly get coffee and bread.

Zeke followed up to ensure we were there at the right time.  We were promptly seated and our bottle sever was attentive to our needs. Zeke provided an enjoyable, positive experience and I would recommend contacting him for your event needs."

Once you know they dress code and why it’s like that you’ll forget there’s a dress code the artist that come always makes it pack which in my opinion is good. The owner is very involved and was very nice. A very friendly face when going. My go to club when I’m in Scottsdale. If you don’t like being crowded, this club is not for you, but if you like having a great time, I definitely recommend going.; HOMOPHOBIC CLUB‼️ GO TO CAKE OR HI-FI INSTEAD FOR FREE‼️ we have been there a few times with no problems until the owner decided to show up this time. 3 security guards let my whole group in. We get in and the owner tells my very masculine gay friend to follow him. I watch him take her outside and tell her she can’t come back. I asked him and he says oh she was rude and I was going to give her a shirt (because apparently both of her shirts were not allowed but no other club in OT  had a problem with it and neither did the 3 11:11 guards who let us in and charged us) but that never once happened. He approached her and asked her to follow him and she was confused but followed immediately. He lied through his yellow teeth and said she was disrespectful when she wasn’t whatsoever. Don’t waste your money here EVERY OTHER CLUB in old town has been accepting and kind. This weird owner lied and even his own guards thought it was messed up but didn’t say anything else to keep their jobs I’m sure. Can’t wait to report fraud to out banks for the cover fee!; Great club, great music, great atmosphere. My group and I had an awesome night.  Everyone was dressed well so don’t show up looking like you just came off the street. I will be returning.; Great experience and highly recommend if you're a fan of R&B and hip-hop! Beautiful hosts/bottle girls, great music, plenty of table seating available and the restaurant next door ""Well Seasoned"" is new and a vibe! I even found parking fairly easy. I didn't have food at 11:11 but the restaurant next door is under the same ownership so 5 stars; Paid $40 to stand in line and it wasn’t even crowded once we got in. The artist basically sat up in the corner & wouldn’t have even know they were there until it was almost time to close & only performed 2 songs and that was it. It’s ok to say you went once but that’s about it."

I just wish the DJ would have played some songs the regular way instead of mostly EDM mixes. But I had a great time and would return. Definitely made my first trip to Phoenix memorable.; The only reason this is not getting a 5 star rating is because of the lack of attractive men. The pretty girl to ugly guy ratio was out of this world. Other than that the vibes were 10/10 and so was the music.

I highly recommend you get a table so that you are not stuck in the sweltering heat or are forced to go in the pool to cool off.

If you are worried about the pool water just dont go in it. However, the pool was packed to the brim so if you’re not worried about germs than yolo!!!

If you are going on a bach/bachelorette trip than you should 100% be including this in your itinerary. But to my first point, if you are going with single girls do not expect to find a man here.

Can’t forget to mention our security guard, Louis, was absolutely amazing!!! He was so attentive and quick with clearing our table of empty cups and plates.; Love this place, however their scheduling with artists is super off. This issue has already happened a total of three times. My friends and I get there at 12pm, it is Arizona so you know the sun is beating down on you, since it is 100+ degree weather.  The artist didn’t come out until 7:00pm, and we were already exhausted from the heat and decided to leave.  So , for this next time / next artist we opted to go a bit later. Since we did just that, the artist played , and we had missed them. There is never a time when said artist will be playing and it is super frustrating. (You do not get a refund unless you picked to pay extra for any sickness related issues/weather conditions) So all I ask for future events is to have the MAIN artist play time on the flyer that is promoted. I get schedules get delayed etc. If the said artist knows when they’re arriving to the area, and how long their equipment takes to prepare, then there should be a set time to when they will start playing. Definitely will be coming back because of the service and how we are treated, but for future events I hope the venue and artists can do better with scheduling.; This pool was a good time. Drinks are pretty pricy. Water is offered for free but in those big water canisters with everyone’s hands touching it. I opt in to buy $6 waters x 3 since it had a lid and was more hygienic. Bathrooms were clean and plenty. Staff is tentative and responsive. The water was a bit murky, couldn’t really see your feet but our group didn’t have issues after our visit.; Charged us $200 for their “house champagne”. The waitress was just like “yeah…” when I questioned her about the twist top $200 champagne bottle."

The atmosphere was there! But whoever was DJing tonight was trash . He wasn’t playing danceable music. Blue face, Kodak, and obscure tracks. Everyone was standing around waiting for THAT song. But it never came. Not one song was danceable. And we paid a $20 cover. So much potential but delivered so little.; They false advertised, kept promoting this event and highlighting that PartyNextDoor was going to perform. We were there the whole night waiting for him to come out, they kept telling us he’s “on his way” & making us believe he was still coming. Imagine the look on my face when the lights turned on & everyone started heading out… & on top of that, none of this has been addressed. Something could’ve happened that made him unavailable but regardless, no one has reached out to us regarding the event or our tickets. So it all just looks and sounds messy. Doesn’t seem like they have any plans of making this right since they deleted their Instagram post that was promoting this specific event. Too many complaints maybe? We just want our money back!!!; Music is always terrible. They need a new DJ. I don't understand why clubs don't evolve. This is a new club but they're giving the same dry experience we have always gotten from clubs. Wish they could have been creative and did something new. There's nowhere to sit but VIP, drinks are expensive, and bathrooms are single rooms with one toilet.; Giving two stars solely because the bartenders were phenomenal.  Overpriced entry ($20). Very underwhelming experience. You know it’s bad when the hype man and/or DJ can barely get a handful of people to dance and enjoy themselves. Music selection  was more of a miss than a hit. Definitely need to work on that.
I will say this place is very much “for the gram” aesthetic. Nothing else.
Also too small of a place to allow so much smoking.; Truly an amazing venue. Intimate but big for a small place that can easily fit about 350 people with 9 tables for bottle service. Drinks priced for a luxury lounge but expect great bartenders and solid service. Latin and hiphop/top40 is the primary music vibe. Definitely going to throw some shows here in the future."

The entrance is kinda hidden and you need a special key code to get in. Once your in the place is kinda small but quaint. Was first time going and was decorated for the special event, so don’t know what it normally looks like. The service was extremely slow, like 2 to 3 hours waiting for our full meal and which my boyfriend didn’t like, but was very delicious and savory. Ordered a special drink which was called the pink gun and was very good and sweet! They also had a belly dancer for the night. All in all the service was super slow, but the experience and place was fun!; Absolutely! Here's a review for Lap Lounge:

The actual barber chairs are a fun detail. The bartender is a true artist and there is a huge variety of cocktail options on the menu. We went on a Wednesday night and the kitchen was already closed so we didn’t get a chance to try the food, but looked like they had some good munchies as well. A must stop if you are out in San Juan!; Love the vibe of this speakeasy, the barber shop theme is awesome, every detail was carefully planned. The got a lot of creative cocktails and every single one we tried was tasty. Very attentive staff, cocktails takes their time. Wednesday night was perfect, not crowded at all. Prices not on menu, but expect to pay $13 per cocktail. Parking on the street, credit cards accepted.; I recently had the pleasure of visiting this cool vibe bar in the Conado area, and it exceeded my expectations in every way. From the moment I walked to the front door, they invited me in, even though they weren't open yet. i  I was captivated by the stylish decor and the welcoming atmosphere. The dimly lit interior, coupled with a well-curated playlist, created the perfect ambiance for a night out.

The bar staff was not only attentive but also incredibly knowledgeable about their extensive cocktail menu. I tried their signature drinks, and each one was a delightful blend of flavors and presentation.

What truly set this bar apart was the music. The diverse crowd made for an engaging and fun experience, and I met some interesting people throughout the evening.

Overall, I can't recommend this cool vibe bar enough. Whether you're looking for a romantic date spot or a place to hang out with friends, it offers an unforgettable experience. I can't wait to go back and enjoy the cool vibes, drinks, and music all over again.; Outstanding drinks! Highly recommend, very welcoming, amazing quality cocktails! Thank you so much Jose and Lucas, my experience in PR was enlightened!! Carlos picture was so handsome!! Thank you guys!!!; We've been wanting a cozy, low key neighborhood bar with decent bar food and can't believe we only just found El Bar Bero! I loved the eclectic, vintage barbershop (bero) decor, good lighting & music- but the drink options were what really impressed. They had all the best ""original"" cocktails- I had the moscow mule & my husband the house manhattan- along with your traditional island drinks, and they were all expertly made. The bar is really the main attraction of the room, and for good reason- the drinks are perfect!

While this isn't a restaurant (so don't expect a server/ you go to the bar to order) they do serve a few food items and again, exceeded our expectations. The fish tacos were delicious and the chicken/sausage sliders- something the door man recommended- were not only tasty but really original. The bill was like $40- which is hard to beat...! We're super excited to have this great local option so close to home!!!

Luis kills it behind the bar!!!!; Cool punk bar in Old San Juan with graffiti and stickers littering the walls. Love the bar cat and diorama someone made of the bar itself inside. Not a huge drink list, but you're there for the vibe anyway. They have a pool table in back and let you smoke at the bar... which is great if you're a smoker and sucks if you aren't, so chose your own adventure!; Spent several hours here getting away from the heat and enjoying some ice cold beers! Super cool spot with writing covering the walls and even the ceiling.

Bianca was bartending and was a pleasure to chat with about the bar, OSJ, and the island in general. Showed us her photo album from her travels around PR and it was stunning.

Last but not least, there's a cat that wanders in and out of the bar named Cleo! (even has an insta). Tough luck if she takes your spot at the bar, but she's the boss.; Cool atmosphere. Nice music. Loved the cat at the bar.

Took way too long to get drinks. Only 2 bartenders on a Sunday. One was preparing many drinks, the other one was new and ignored us. Prices are definitely higher than most bars, but the place was mostly full of tourist, so they wouldn’t know.; El Batey Bar is way up there on my list of best dive bars in the world. It's a very cool mess. And you can't beat the $5 beer and a run shot combo. Definitely worth a stop if you're on a pub crawl in San Juan."

It doesn’t serve food (except when one of the ladies brings Alcapurrias from home) and it has a slamming JUKEBOX with the BEST SOUND SYSTEM!!! Every Puerto Rican hit from the Fania All-Stars is there. Bomba y Plena, Salsa, Santana, Roberto Roena, Celia Cruz, you name it, it’s on their jukebox.

They place Rubbermaid chairs in front and people from the neighborhood gather here on quiet afternoons to enjoy the camaraderie, music, an ice-cold Medalla and the breeze from the ocean 🌊 .

Thank you to the owner! 💐 💐 💐 Your jukebox brought me a lot of joy.; Could have better option for dinner.
Didn't serve Rice and Beans after 8pm.
Was not too great of a meal.
But the atmosphere and music was awesome.; This is where the locals hang out on Sunday from noon until late at night. Salsa, cha cha cha, guajira, plena, bomba and all
Kinds of afro-caribbean music to enjoy. Beers, cocktails and delicious puertorican food.; Slow, bad service. Overpriced for the kind of food that is served. Was expecting more, the server had an attitude. Will not.return and neither recommend it.; I love this place!!!"

I got the most basic of basic : vodka soda and a medalla, can't go wrong. Atmosphere is cool, they have a bucket of things to decorate dollar bills with and add them to the wall, we put a T-Shirt shaped dollar up. It's worth the stop :); I absolutely LOVED this bar! It was soooo beautiful; not to mention, Miguel was the best bartender I’ve ever met!! He took great care of my bf and I for my 21st birthday this week! There are various shot flavors that will knock your socks off! Will be returning soon :); Used to be cooler before renovation. They make it out as if they were nice but me and my friends were inviting rounds, the exact same and got charged different prices, it will all depend on much the bartender fancies you. Or they add tip to the total, when I was already tipping generously. And by the time they close they want you gone in seconds, it doesn’t matter if you’re confused, drunk, talking, they will get in your face, grab you by the arm so that you leave. And as a person that has been assaulted that was super triggering, when I reacted as I got startled at being grabbed and said whats going on, dude got aggressive and shouting at me. Worst experience at a bar in a while.; Place is awesome but service took forever to get served by bartender, there was literally like 4 people seated at the bar if I wasn’t because I said something I probably would’ve never got served to be honest I should’ve left then before leaving I ordered a beer to go and after charging me I sat there like 5 to 8 mins waiting for her to grab my beer knowing I was leaving .; Favorite bar in all of PR so far. Always the nicest staff. They keep the drinks coming like no other. Thousands of artistic dollars on the walls. Great music and vibes. You gotta experience it. San Banito drink is fire!"

- Pretty good vibe although gets a little too crowded on late hours of the night, and its a small space.
- Music keeps repeating over and over. Would recommend to bar hop.
- Street parking only.
- Cobble stoned narrow roads.
- Seemed to be a gay bar? Or just a lot of LGBTQ+ people hanging out at that time.; Great fun vibe and the drinks were amazing I didn’t know they sold food here I brought a mojito with friends my drinks were good and flavorful; The mojitos are delicious must come and have a coconut mojito love ❤️; The best $5 mojitos!!!!!! Good music, food, games and dancing. Super tiny spot though, so if you manage to get a table hang onto it. I prefer this bar to La Factoría across the street. The only complaint is the bathrooms. They don’t have doors on the bathrooms and you have to ask for tissue at the bar.; This place has great but cheap mojitos, especially the tamarind one, which is very tasty. You can also play board games here. It's a fun spot with good drinks, cool music, and a friendly vibe, making it perfect for a fun outing."

The bar itself is clean and spacious, and the overall vibe is just great. We loved it here!; It’s located in an old soda factory. The historic decor was very nice. They make their own sodas and have creative drinks. Although I did not try their food because the kitchen had already closed, I enjoyed my Piragua drink with banana liquor, my friend’s old fashioned was one of the best and I enjoyed reading their interesting soda menu. I will be returning and recommend.; Probably one of the best cocktails i have had. We had 4 diff cocktails and they were all excellent! The details and ingredients of cocktail was next lvl; You will have a mixologists experience here. Mixologist are wonderful. Sit at the bar and you will find out as they prepare the cocktails. Place is away from the crowded places. You may have to walk a little around to find it.; Drinks were amazing and the atmosphere is beautiful and relaxed. If you're looking for a fancy cocktail with every little detail carefully planned out, this is the place. I had the rum old fashioned and it may have been the best drink I had in my week in Old San Juan. It's a bit pricey, but well worth a look if craft cocktails are your thing."

1 star because they will cheat you out of your tip!! She (with the long black hair) asked how much tip on the CC? I said 15% for 1 drink, she takes 30% 😂

I don't care about the $2 she pocketed but it's the principal!! So I asked her why did you take more tiip, what did you think I said? She answers 18%....but it's more like 30%!!!

You bet I took what she tried to pocket 🤪
Don't insult people's intelligence!!

Again watch your money especially when paying by CC!!; Overall experience to be just average. While the beer and drinks were decent, the service left much to be desired. The staff seemed indifferent and inattentive, which dampened the enjoyment of an otherwise okay selection of beverages. Unfortunately, I wouldn’t recommend it based solely on the service.; Delicious food! Burgers, chicken, and padtelillos were awesome. A really nice low key vibe on a busy day in Old Saun Juan.; It's what we call a ""Hole In The Wall"" Back home, and it didn't disappoint. We caught an Uber twice from Condado to Old San Jaun just for the food. The owner and service were equally as nice. Place is very laid back, a hidden gem💎. The wings and chicken on a stick were amazing. The house Sangria is a definite must try here too😉.; We came across this bar by pure chance, we were just looking for a place to get out of the rain after spending the day in Old San Juan. We were just gonna have a drink and wait for the rain to pass, boy we ended up staying almost 4 hrs there ..lol,  You cant beat there house drink, Mojitos and the price 2 for $10. We also weren't gonna eat , but we ordered a Cuban sandwich and we highly recommend it...The atmosphere and the staff is what made us stick around.

The Pina colada was refreshing and tasty! I recommend the steak stuffed fried plantain, and the Tirita sampler. The serving portion is good and the food is packed with flavor. I’m Jamaican and I can tell when food is seasoned perfectly!

Our server Gigi was awesome! She was friendly and made us feel welcomed. She even have us try shots of this pomegranate flavored drink. It was amazing and had my tastebuds dancing.

Malta was nice & cold.
Empanada just ok. Something to put on my stomach.

Yep...I'd come back.; This review is for the people like me who read the bad reviews and didn’t believe in them.
I bought a vodka tonic and a tequila sunrise, when I ask for the total the bartender said it was 38 dollars, after that my friend scanned the menu and both drinks were supposed to be a total of 23 dollars, I don’t know what’s their deal but my second step after the review will be reporting them to DACO, I recommend everyone scammed there to do the same, not for the money but to save other ppl from being in the same situation.

We were greeted with “What?” We ordered 2 pina coladas and when it was time to pay she just stared at us. I had to ask what the total was and then she threw my change at me. I was beyond shocked.; A relaxing place in front of San Juan Bay.
Great experience, great drinks, friendly
personnel.
I do recommend Cafe Darsenas.; 🇵🇷 A charming simple open-air kiosk with bar stools encircling their “Pagoda-like” structure. There are some picnic tables nearby to sit at too.

It’s set in a small park with shade trees overlooking beautiful San Juan Bay  known as “Plaza Darsena” (dar sane ah) it sits beside all of the cruise 🚢 ships.

They’re lone bartender can provide: ;
Terrific Rum Punch 🍷 , Soda’s 🥤 and Beer 🍺., Coffee ☕️ Hard Liquor 🥃 and simple bar snacks like potato chips. It’s kind of a hidden gem, it’s calm and relaxing, totally chilled out  - never rowdy,

Cart vendors nearby sell Fried Puerto Rican savory treats and other local treats , try one! Perhaps a Bacalaito (bah cah lah ee toe) it’s a codfish fritter. Tastes like a pancake version of KFC’s Fried Chicken batter,  it’s not fishy tasting at all!!! 🇵🇷

Situated on the beautiful shores of the Caribbean Sea, this beach club offers a range of amenities and activities for visitors to enjoy. However, despite its popularity, some may argue that Escambrón Beach Club is just an okay beach, especially considering the $5 entrance fee.

One of the main reasons why some may consider Escambrón Beach Club to be just an okay beach is the fact that there is an entrance fee of $5. While this may not seem like a significant amount, especially for tourists who are used to paying for beach access in other destinations, it can be a deterrent for some visitors. Many people believe that beaches should be free and open to the public, and having to pay for access can take away from the overall experience.

Additionally, some may argue that the amenities and activities offered at Escambrón Beach Club are not worth the entrance fee. While the beach club does have facilities such as restrooms, showers, and picnic areas, as well as rental equipment for water sports, some visitors may feel that these amenities are not enough to justify the cost. In comparison to other beaches in the area that offer similar amenities for free, Escambrón Beach Club may not stand out as a top choice for beachgoers.

Furthermore, the beach itself may not be as impressive as other beaches in Puerto Rico. While the water is clear and the sand is soft, some visitors may find that the beach is crowded and lacks the natural beauty that they were expecting. The presence of the beach club and the surrounding buildings can also take away from the natural charm of the area, making it feel more like a commercialized beach experience rather than a peaceful retreat.

Despite these criticisms, Escambrón Beach Club does have its merits. The beach club is well-maintained and clean, and the staff are friendly and helpful. The location is also convenient, with easy access to parking and nearby restaurants and shops. For those who are looking for a beach experience with amenities and activities, Escambrón Beach Club may still be a good choice, even with the $5 entrance fee.

In conclusion, Escambrón Beach Club may be considered just an okay beach by some due to the entrance fee and the overall beach experience. While the amenities and location are convenient, the beach itself may not be as impressive as other beaches in the area. Ultimately, whether or not Escambrón Beach Club is worth the; On vacation from Ohio, and we loved this beach, a must go when in Puerto Rico 🇵🇷; Love this place. This was our go to for a beach. Clear blue water with our own private lagoon. They have a place where you can rent snorkel and scuba gear. Clean restrooms and showers.; The water is crystal clear, beautiful view of the ocean.   Great place to snorkel.   Parking is only 5 bucks.   Real bathrooms on site no Ed's heads.   People mind there own and are beyond helpful and friendly.   Always a great time at this beach.   A must 👀; Beautiful beach!!! The water is clear and warm. Excellent view. Plenty of parking. Don't make the mistake I did and buy a Pina colada on the beach. They taste awful and cost $10. The owner had the nerve to argue with me because I told him it tasted awful to his face. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"

I understand dress code, but they were letting plenty of people with “tables” in with shorts. This is only one out of countless bars/clubs on this amazing street, don’t waste your time here.; This place has an inside patio’s door that gets open every few seconds, and the music gets out blasting into their neighbors’ homes until 5am some days of the weekend. Between the ultra loud music and the people yelling, this “club” has disrupted the peace of their neighbors (who have been there for generations) in a very disgusting manner. This should be illegal.; from thursday to saturday, they blast reggaeton nonstop all night long right next to where elderly people have resided for decades. shameful and utterly disrespectful; Love this place! 5 stars (but needs better baño situation.

It’s the ideal place to let go of the day and feel connected to inner joy. You can enjoy killer alcohol free versions of their cocktails that will knock your socks off as well.

The bartenders are exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable and the atmosphere is pleasantly sedated. The kind of gay bar that you could just hang out at for some company and a nice drink and wouldn't even know it was a gay bar until you started noticing the rainbows dotted around. Where is plenty of parking and outdoor seating around back for when the inside gets a little too exciting.; There can be very rude to their customers who are actually the ones that are paying their checks. I came in with my 83-year-old friend in the bartender was absolutely rude to her and says for the third time what the hell do you want to drink is that the way you should talk to your customer? We will not be back to this nasty place unless they get a new manager to run it or a new owner; Great atmosphere and Mondays are $2 of every drink all day. Karaoke Fridays at 9pm. It's my new favorite place!; Was a good night - they didn't have an early cover but I think when the drag show started there may have been one - the show was fun fast interesting - they do have an outdoor patio bar; This place is fabulous! I always love coming here. It's always a good time.

The only issue I have is with one of the bartenders. I've heard from many people that there is a bartender with red hair that is extremely rude and unprofessional.

Last night I finally had an interaction with him, and now I see why so many people have an issue with him.

I've heard he sometimes does not put liquor in your drink and then charges you for it. Well last night, 2 of my friends and myself had this experience...

I figured people were probably overly drunk and he cut them off and they were upset about it; however, last night my first drink of the night was great, but my 2nd and 3rd drink had ZERO alcohol in it. I made sure to have others taste it to confirm this was the case.

I would give this place a 5 star review if it weren't for this rude bartender inside. The bartender outside was very kind and professional.

I will not be getting my drinks at the inside bar if that rude bartender is working, that's for sure."

A fun and safe atmosphere is always maintained.; Mixed feelings here. Its like an upscale dive bar. Margaritas are terrible! I wanted to jump behind the bar and make my own! I suppose you should only order 2 ingredient drinks because my Tito's and soda was ok. Don't ask for an Old Fashioned or Mai Tai here! HOWEVER, the ambiance was super chill and the music was great. There is a dance floor and a restaurant next door that you can get food from for the bar. There seems to be a decent mix of oldsters and youngsters and it seems like a cool place for a group of friends. I will go back on a Thursday or Friday to see what the crowd is like.; I'm from Missouri and have just moved to Gulfport a week ago. A Google search indirectly lead me to awareness of this place. I was ended up on their Facebook page and saw that it was a place for older crowds. Just what I was looking for. I loved my first experience at this lovely place. The staff were very welcoming and friendly. I will definitely be going back and recommending others to come out as well.; They had a R&B it was great. I would recommend a night out for mid 40 to 65 group; Terrible place. But if you like low standard service this is the place for you. Signs everywhere saying no weed and that's all you smell in the back outside. After 11pm the service just collapses. You have to wait for over 30mins to get a drink. They talk to their regulars like they have no one else to serve and 20 people are waiting. They don't care at all. I ordered food and it never came after 1 hr 30 mins. Had to even wait to get my refund. I know in low income areas this is expected so if this doesn't bother you then this is the place for you. I just deman better especially when you have a cover charge. That's a clear sign of a low income club."

The owner makes everyone feel welcome and the drinks aren't expensive.   Gilligan's is fun place to hangout.; Three women from out of town went in this place because one loves to karaoke. Instantly felt out of place. The bartender was very ugly and rude at first but once we ordered and tipped she became more friendly. As soon as we finished our one beer we left. Pool sticks were absolutely horrible. Do not recommend for out of towners.; If you blink, you'd drive right past it, but Gilligan's is a cool, dark respite from the slow Southern heat of south Mississippi. Very low brow and reserved, the crowd leans towards the Retired end of the spectrum. Super friendly staff, the manager even came and introduced himself to me, since he didn't recognize me. There's home-cooked food available for patrons sometimes and live music other times. If you want to relax & unwind and you're okay with the scent of smoke lingering on your clothes, Gilligan's is a comfortable spot to put up your feet and relax.; Awesome 👌 karaoke 🎤 bar. Very fun atmosphere and a very nice bartender and patrons; A small treasure cove of a bar, with reasonably priced bottled beer (no tap) and lots of bottled liquor and booze.

The best thing, for us, was the great karaoke!!!

The owner is a former Brit and her daughter is the bartender.

Place is very clean and staff is friendly.; I've had mixed experiences with Latin night at this venue. While I appreciate the Mexican bands they bring in, it's always the same lineup and gets repetitive. I'm tired of the high ticket prices ($50+!) and miss the old days when Latin night was more affordable and featured a DJ spinning a variety of music (bachata, merengue, salsa, etc.).

If you're looking for a great example of how to get the party started with Latin music, check out Club Unique in Moss Point. Their DJs know how to create a lively atmosphere that appeals to everyone.

They have several local favorites on the menu, but their in-house buffalo sauce is something worth trying.

The staff has and remains one of the reasons I continue to come back. They are friendly and makes everyone feel like a local/regular.
They will be loosing one of their greatest treasure, Nancy.

We'll be back for sure.; I am a foodie and very critical on service and they knocked it out the park; for a pub you can tell the owner really put time into the menu. In addition to that the Bartenders and the cook was super awesome and friendly

It is a local type feel with some pool tables in the back if you have a group, highly recommend checking it out if you’re in town

And I do see some negative reviews here, but if you don’t tip at all and are a regular then I’m sure you will get poor service, how else are they going to make money?

They have great selection of drinks, and bartenders make delicious handcrafted cocktails.
Definitely recommend .; This spot was cool, right off the casino floor. Strange that the waitresses kinda ignored us but it was still a cool spot. Live music was really good.; Loved this little bar! Bartenders were awesome! We had such a great time meeting others around this little oval, made fast friends. It was standing room only every night, the band was very good!; We had a group of 8 that came in looking for a good time.

I had the GZBC. I am not exaggerating when I say it is the best burger I have had in 2024.  The “young’s fries” were delicious also. When it was time for the bill, Kylie let me know that military get 20% off there bill.  This is also a great venue for blues performances.

Photos include views of the stage (some visual obstruction) and the bar on each side.  There is a large screen overhead so that shows what's on stage, plus a few monitors behind each bar.  No bad seat downstairs. The drinks were great and service was good. Bathrooms were clean, a/c was great. We didn't get any food. There wasn't really any ""standing room"" - everyone was given a seat and mostly stayed sitting during the show.

I peeked upstairs at 3rd floor. Would be great to hang out, but there is very limited viewing of the stage.

The interior has an underground vibe that really helps set the mood.  We enjoyed the meal and drinks along with the live entertainment.; First time patron coming here for dinner. Did not know there would be a cover charge to enter but was informed there was live performer tonight. A great place to come if you like to hear live music. Great atmosphere. My wife and I sat at the high tables. I ordered a hamburger with fries. Can’t recall the name of the burger but it was cooked to my specifications and the patty was thick. My wife had the Cajun hot wings. As an appetizer, we had the homemade potato chips.

Even when I don't go in during the week I ride my bike past it all the time (usually after 9pm) and it's often pretty lively. A big plus is that it's in a decent spot with quick access to hwy 90 if you're coming from Gulfport or bay st Louis. The draft beer is crisp (they clean their lines & taps) and the is solid.

When we met with Jeanne and the team at Maison Bourbon (Vieux Carre Venues), we were so excited about the possibilities! The venue has a balcony facing the best and most lively intersection of Bourbon St. and is such a gorgeous space. We rented both rooms - one above Maison Bourbon which is adjoined with the one above MyBar@365. We had our wedding catered and our guests are still raving about the selection of food. We highly recommend the brisket and the oysters!
There was so much comfortable seating and they allowed us bring in our own beads to toss from the balcony. There were clean restrooms, two full bars, and the ambiance was spectacular! We are so thankful to get to work with Jeanne as our coordinator - she is truly the sweetest and most patient person! We had so many questions along the way and their team never hesitated to get right back to us with details. Don't sleep on this venue! It's affordable and truly worth the experience!; Visited in early March. We were wandering down Bourbon Street heading for a different bar but came across this place. What a revelation!

It appeared fairly quiet, but had a great jazz band playing, and felt really authentic.

The beer was excellent and the barman kept things flowing, including the jokes. Also, had a great Sazerac.

We took in the atmosphere and were entranced by the music.

Would definitely recommend a visit, and would love to go back again.; What a wonderful place to hear some good jazz music in New Orleans and amazing cocktails. Loved the ambience. They don’t serve food. One of the best places in French Quarters.; A lovely place to hear jazz on Bourbon St. We walked past the bar and stood at the window to listen to the band. The next evening we stopped in, sat at the bar and had a quick drink as we enjoyed the band. Definitely worth sitting down on the comfy chairs for good jazz; If you want to try voodoo  Daiquiris and listened to live Jazz at the same time you can't go wrong with this place.

I felt Daiquiris wasn't really my favourite I really liked the bar and the Jazz. Super fun and what a vibe.

I met a waitress that she turned out to be super friendly and I didn't have a chance to know her name but all best for her to visit my country and do Thai massage as she wished. She told me about how strong Daiquiris could be.

Great vibe and great music I'm sure their drink were also good I wished I tried hurricane instead lol.

During the movie, they kept cutting the sound and making it difficult to hear. They also had NO movie poster for this film while every other movie had its poster displayed. This theater couldn’t even bother to correctly spell the title of the movie.
0/5 stars for this theater.
5/5 stars for this movie.
Well done, MATT WALSH!!! THE GRIFT IS UP!!!!; Chairs are very comfy. Picture and volume were excellent. Prices for admission and food are way too expensive,  but that has come to be the norm at all theaters.; I wish I could give zero stars.
Very unpleasant experience at Cinemark Gulfport today. I haven’t been in a while because other theaters seem newer and better but decided to give them another chance. I regret it. The smell inside is comparable to stinky feet. The ledges that are in between each row are nearly impossible to see over for kids and short people. I am 4’10 and couldn’t recline my seat or I couldn’t see. The 3 kids with me had to sit on their feet to see. The theater was so hot as well. Pretty uncomfortable for even my 5 year old who complained of being hot.
Lastly, their menu is very deceptive. I’ve attached a picture for reference. I asked multiple people and all agreed that if you buy a large drink (fountain or icee) you get free refills. I was denied refills because it’s “sodas only”. Although it does not specify. I even spoke with the manager and pointed out how deceptive the menu was and she refused to make it right.

I’ve been a patron of premiere Lux theater in Biloxi and the comparison is mind blowing. Free refills on ALL drinks and popcorn. Clean and smells nice. They have tables at the chairs and no ledges that obscure the view.
It is a much better option and worth the extra drive.; I love going to this location cause it's clean has nice workers and the seats are comfortably. I went again today and watched it ends with us. That movie was amazing. Food is expensive but tasty.; I went to watch the new ""Twisters"", and overall, it was decent. The movie was great, but the theater wasn't cleaned from the previous movie. There was a lot of trash and things scattered around. At least my seat didn't have any trash. The seats were pretty comfy, and they reclined."

They played everything from Chaka Khan to Whitney Houston to the Jackson 5 to the gap band to Jill Scott to Erykah Badu to NEO. Very nicely done!!!!; Awesome music and good service. Had good time. No pushy bar tenders or arrogant bouncers. The crowd was also good. Restrooms were also clean.

**most drinks are priced around $14; Good cover band strong drinks. This unapologetically a disco down disco ball.  It ‘s not too crowded  a little room to dance. If you go you should dance; Comfortable place with a great vibe. Live band, crowd, bartender, and even the bathroom attendant were all great. Hurricane I had here was the best tasting I had while visiting New Orleans.

We did not experience the overcharging mentioned in other reviews. In fact I liked how the bartender handled pricing. The music is so loud inside, the bartender rang up drinks on the register so I could see the amount before paying, which I always did with cash.

If there is a negative on this place it would be the very loud music volume."

The minute you walk in the door it feels like you're in an amazing creative space and it's al out magical. The band that was there when I visited was a relatively large brass band and the sound was great. Their sound guy is top notch. The drinks are expertly crafted and delicious and the staff was attentive and quick.; This place was off the chain!! My cousin and I were in search of hearing some great jazz music before leaving town, and this place delivered! The spot may be small, but it provided a more intimate setting. When the music started playing, it took that funky chill vibe to another level! They have a great drink selection as well, so between the libations and music, the mood is just right. I'd recommend coming here to listen to any musician, have a drink and a great time!; Went on the earlier end, so I imagine it gets busier and more lively as the night goes on - but even at 9:30/10pm, the band playing were great. Energetic and played a variety of hits, jazz style. The place was buzzing even with a smaller crowd. Drinks were decent and inexpensive.; This place is great with nice atmosphere and gets crowded over the weekend. I would recommend if you visit New Orleans.; I really dig the Blue Nile on Frenchmens street. It's a standing venue with a lot of good acts. This time, I saw Irvin Mayfield with an assortment of other characters including; Cyrille Neville, Kermit Ruffins, Jamal Batiste and others, plus a 6 person choir singing backup vocals from the audience. Quite the unique experience. Only in NOLA."

Recommend boudin egg rolls, sweet potato biscuit and cheesecake; The po boy was excellent. Great recommendation from the server. Shrimp tasted fresh, and the portion was very good if you are hungry. I also loved the French fries. Live music was playing and also the outdoor patio was very nice. Beers were cold and service was great. Definitely willing to go back and take coworkers with me.; If you're looking for authentic Nawlins food and atmosphere, this is the place. The gumbo and red beans and rice are phenomenal! Haven't been to the city in 24 years and haven't had either of those dishes anywhere else that could compare! Thank you for the nostalgia and the great food!; We really enjoy the atmosphere and dinner time Mike  at the door was awesome !the bathrooms were clean and the music was what drawn us in from down the block! Plus you can’t forget the 2 for one drinks and bang bang shrimp happy hour it was very hot so we sat outside in the misters it was a very relaxing stop! Definitely worth the stop great conversation with Mike and other patrons smoking patios. Make your way to burbon Heat on bourbon st . if you are in the French quarter it doesn’t matter if it’s night or day. But dinner time mike was awesome and informative.; Stopped here to eat with my wife while walking on bourbon street and we really enjoyed the company of the bartender Nikki who is such a beautiful girl she has us laughing the whole time plus she makes the best bloody Mary’s we also the tacos and gumbo which we both enjoyed. The band included a saxophone player who was really blowing so the music was a vibe. Def a cool daytime spot we will be back"

There were four of us and she didn’t put one of the others Poo-boy sandwich order in so he had to wait, we all waited till he got his food to eat which means it was all cold. Her service to the customer will kill any business!!! Price could be a little cheaper for what you get; One of our favorites when we go to Biloxi. We’ve gone several times, and we’re always pleased. Be careful with what you order because some items are enough for two people. Chicken skins were a big hit with my boyfriend. On our visits,
We’ve tried shrimp po boy, quesadillas, and burgers. Everything is always delicious! Check them out the next time you’re in town.; Fun bar atmosphere. Our 1st meal of the day…all good. Bloody Mary was ok.  Service great.  We got there when they opened the doors 4th of July, its was packed 15 minutes later. God Bless the USA.; I went here based on a bartender's recommendation (from Beau Rivage).  He made sure to warn me about the cigarette smoke.
I went around late lunch time on a Monday, so there wasn't that many people in there.  I sat at the bar, and even though a couple of people were smoking, I wasn't bad at all (no worse than any of the casinos).  I think timing has to do with everything.  I can see when this place is packed, that it's probably smoke filled.  They also have an outdoor patio
Service was outstanding.  The bar staff were friendly and welcoming.  The food is outta control. You wouldn't think it when you walk in, but I wish I lived nearby to try the massive menu.
I got the The ""Ultimate"" Oyster Po-Boy sandwich with a side of fries.  I was starving, and I couldn't finish it.  I also don't think I've ever had bacon on a po boy and it worked so well.
The bread was super soft and fresh, the oysters tasted fresh, the bacon was quality and the fried green tomatoes were delicious.  On top of that, the fries were excellent (and I consider myself a fry snob).  Everything that was fried tasted like fresh oil to me.  I made sure to finish all the good stuff (oysters/tomatoes).  The quantity is unbelievable.
Grab some cold drinks and have an awesome meal at this local/dive bar.  You won't be disappointed.  I suggest lunch/afternoon to avoid the crowds and cigarette smoke.; Excellent fast service. Great game day or late night atmosphere. The New Orleans oysters are amazing!!! Also had the Chicken Philly and it was spot on in flavor! We will definitely be back here!"

The owner is working hard in the PR economy to promote a sustainable food system.; We joined El Pretexto for our honeymoon. It was amazing! We had a room with a heated pool with gorgeous views of the mountains. The room was clean, comfortable, and cozy. Crystal was able to accommodate my dietary restrictions. We felt completely safe and were well taken care of. She planned a massage, yoga class, and meditation class for us. We learned a lot about Puerto Rico and their food systems and culture. Local renowned chefs gave us lessons on their cuisine which included bbq, seafood, desserts, sofrito, and much more. We were not the only ones on the food experience. We were joined by 2 other lovely couples. By the end of the trip, we felt like one big family. It was bittersweet to end our journey because Crystal made us all feel like a part of her family.

If you’re with your sweetheart, ask for the couples massage!; The chef, the owner, they could not be nicer people. The food was stunningly good, a perfect compliment to the views of the Puerto Rican sunset behind the misty mountains. If you get the chance to stay here, do not hesitate.; I really enjoyed my stay at El Pretexto! From the moment I  arrived i felt welcomed. The farm to table food was unlike anything i have tasted before.  It was a dream come true for a foodie like me. Being surrounded by nature was just what i needed to disconnect for a little bit.

Thanks for allowing us to come and train :); Came once for open mat, I'm white belt, coach did a mir lock and before I could even reach my arm popped I was out for 3 months, and my arm took forever to fully recover to be able to even throw a ball.

Obviously don't think he did it on purpose but I don't really think it was necessary or good judgment to crank a mir lock on a beginner, first time in the gym, either against a black belt.

Especially Mir lock is known to be a dirty move and can easily injure someone. Essentially the mir lock threshold from pain to tearing a ligament is very close, so before I even felt pain my ligament tore.

First time I've been injured like this and I was sparring 3x a week for a long time so it isn't just random. This was like a year ago. I left three stars because it wasn't intentional but I wouldn't expect the black belt coach to do that when I've been sparring with plenty of other purple, brown and black belts without issues.; Great group of guys.   Very welcoming with a nice and spacious mat.  Weight room and wait room.  High level people and high level jiu jitsu.; This place is awesome.

The dancers were attentive, hot, and welcoming. The DJ kept the music great. Would highly recommend.; I’m in the Uber leaving now. Decent girls, but terrible dancers. Like really bad. They don’t even get near the stage. Not one of them touched a pole or the stage. One girl had on a fur coat and was playing with a beach ball with another girl. That’s what the dancers were doing. And it’s $30/song for a dance, and it’s incredibly boring the way they dance. One girl literally made sound effects like “pow pow, boom boom” lol. Can’t help but laugh at it. If you’re bored with a couple dollars then go. If you want to have a real experience, wait to go to Atlanta.; It was ok cute girls but not that busy and expensive drinks; Worst strip club ever! Total rip off! They charge $20 to enter, and then $30 for “lap dance”. They don’t even give a proper lap dance, just dances in front of you. They say it’s topless but it isn’t! At least it isn’t included in the $30 lap dance; they ask for more. The staff is rude, very rude! You have to have a drink ALL THE TIME. Just ridiculous! Save your money and don’t go."

Review: This Bar was super! The ambiance was great, the bartenders were awesome and the food was tasty. We started off with an empanadilla de carne frita which was good had a nice flaky crust and the carne was tender. Then the super wings with a side of bbq sauce were nice and crunchy with added tanginess from the sauce. Finally the star of the show were the fully loaded fries and they don’t skimp on the toppings. These were cheesy loaded with beef and chicken. I can’t wait to go back and try their other food options.

Rating: 8/10
Fully Loaded Fries
Empanadilla de carne frita
Super Wings; Great place to hang out with friends and have something to eat. Will definitely visit again.; Found this place on Yelp while looking for a place to watch the Patriots vs Dolphins game (my Pats squished the fiah 43-0).  Showed up and found an awesome superhero-themed bar with great service, fun atmosphere, and lots of TVs.  The food was great and the service was amazing. They made me feel so welcomed and felt like a regular by the time I walked out. Best sports bar I have been to... definitely be coming back for all my football needs.; The outside doesnt look great but this place is a hidden gem. Good rock music
Great food
Great service

Curfew was reinstated so the establishment had to close by 9pm. This place had great music. A mixture of hip hop, reggae, and reggaeton. Drinks are affordable. Hookahs are $20. The only con was the service when we first arrived. My group stood at door waiting for a staff member to acknowledge and seat us. Two staff members walked by. Finally I went to the bar and asked what was going on. The bartender explained that patrons come to bar n order hookah n drinks. It would have been nice if staff informed us of this especially because we were waiting by the entrance looking lost and confused. But in all this place has potential; My group wound up at this little place just trying to find something fun to do and we ended up meeting some great people and just talking and having a blast. Thanks for making our night out memorable!; My 1st time visiting this establishment and they are very nice… bryan have been a great host & the prices are awesome. Music is nice and the hookah was good. Overall a great experience and i will continue to come back here. Excellent 1st experience glad i found this place.. oh and the open bar was the perfect thing!!!; Went at 12am on a Wednesday and they were closed but their hours said open until 2am. Please update hours.

Update: Thank you for updating your hours after this review I made. No need to gaslight. Good luck to you all; After trying to find a lit place for me and my girlfriends to hang out we came across this place on Google maps. Super fun, we got a table and hookah, had drinks and danced. Exactly what we were looking for with good music. We had a rental car might be hard to find with taxi"

Kudos to all of them because they do as much as they can to manage the orders at the bar... but the owner need to do a LOT bettet to reorganize the operation at the bar. The owner is losing money because when it's crowded, the staff can't keep up with the volume of orders and the amount of people they have to manage when its crowded. Specially when they are having a special event. I overheard someone laughing while saying, that he ordered three rounds and they billed him only one. They need to do much better to speed up the lines to order and pay when its packed. I don't know how often it gets crowded, but if it's often, then they are losing money big time. I could have spent 3 times what I spent if I didn't had to spend 20min in line to order a round of drinks. I hope if their management sees this review, they take it as a constructive review rather than a negative one. Despite all this, I would visit again!!

Don't take me wrong, I had a great time with my friends, we had a lot of fun, met great people, the atmosphere was great! I'm looking forward to see positive improvements next time!!; Okay this was a total stop and go! But it was a great one! Very rarely does a bartender actually acknowledge you, so you know to wait because they are busy. This may not seem like a big deal, but think about ... how many times have you waited at a bar wondering if they've noticed you?? This place is great. The vibe, the staff, the music. They had a dj!

It's a small & the drinks are great if not slightly expensive for some beverages.

Staff was attentive and nice.

Their Kawaii drink was cute and tasty! ( wish they would sell the cups though- it would make more sense of the price for the drink)

Def would go again just to hang out with friends so we could show off this novelty bar for fun.; Anime inspired bar. The anime named drinks are great and about your typical $10/$12 like any bar. Arcade games are available. Wednesday OnlyJams gets poppin starting at 9. I love the booth sections. Yes there is loud music, you’re coming to drink at a bar, not just to watch anime like you’re at home. Ran by Cobra Arcade management.

A lot of people in the reviews upset that it’s not super “anime authentic” here. I’m really not sure what more they expected out of a bar. This is pretty much a bar that just so happens to be anime inspired. To a normie that’s not super into anime, it was great and good enough for me!; If I could give this place a zero I would. My cousin and I waited 20 minutes to used the restroom. When we got in there was no toilet paper. I alone stepped out to get napkins. The security was on a power trip and refused to let me inside accused me of short cutting. I went to give my cousin the napkins who was still in the waiting and he slammed the bathroom door open in front of everyone and forced us to get out. She could have been naked in there thank goodness she wasn’t or we’d be pressing charges.; Came here with a couple of friends in June. It's a lot of fun - Great music/dancing, drinks, and the environment is really cool with all of the anime pictures. Definitely will be coming back soon! Only downside is the Dance Floor is kind of small.; I'v been here twice on a Wednesday because of my friends, which also happens to be there better night's if you like hip-hop & r&b but recently I went late about 11pm as usual and there was a line a normal but no one was barely inside or on the patio.

I'v seen cobra packed through out the night, out to the patio with no problem on latin night's. This place has obviously got a stereo type towards one race (black people), especially on a night where you get to hear good music.

I only gave it 1 star for the music. The location is small and wear your worst shoes because the floor is filled with drinks.

I only write this because this is something I only noticed in a place like Scottsdale that's why I stopped going. but now starting to see downtown.

If your looking for a place you will be accepted and still play great music I know much better establishments.

If you want to enjoy security staff that judges you at the door especially the short white security guard with the long scruffy black and white beard who acts like it's his first day on the job. Well Hi-Score is your place.

I hope to return and have different experience. Be better Hi-Score it's literally the name and I gave you a 1 star."

Affordable shows and affordable drinks. I enjoy the lounge set up.  Staff is always good and service is too.; Wouldn’t recommend the bollywood night parties here! No clue of the DJ until 10 PM, for the night that was supposed to start at 9 PM! When asked, the staff mentions that they are missing a few cables! Lol! Funny people! Not gonna recommend this to anyone ever atleast if you are looking forward to any such bollywood parties!; This place hosts some pretty hardcore artists and expects you to just stand and nod your head. If moshpits are your thing do not go you will get arrested. I’m not sure why they’d allow hardcore artists to play where moshpits are expected then heavily police the floor and kick anyone who gets remotely rowdy out of the venue. I suggest they stick to hosting house music.; This place has declined significantly. The way they handle patrons is not professional. Security shows disdain for both men and women. For example, a friend who is neurodivergent was expelled because she ""looked"" inebriated. She was denied the opportunity to assert herself. There were other people who were denied before entry. How do you judge the appearance of people before allowing them to enter? I can attest; there were definitely a mix of people in line who appeared sober and also drunk. Yet they denied many people in line. I don’t wish anything bad on this establishment, but I simply wish everyone who decides to spend their money on them would be treated with more dignity.; Please save your money and go to literally any other venue. Staff here is so uptight and rude for no reason (besides bartenders they’re nice). They act like it’s some exclusive cool place when they actually have local djs and a lame lighting setup. Won’t ever be back."

Now about the store! It's clean,  organized but do not have most of the products I was looking for.; This is the last time I will ever enter this Sams. One of the worst on the island 👎🏽Every time I go to this sam,there is always something that goes wrong ALWAYS 😑 Well today was a nightmare. As soon as we found parking, Almost every parking space had a cart 😖 so we kept moving back and forth until we parked. Then when we reach in front of the entrance, guess what? No carts 😅🤣😡😤because half was in the parking lots and others was inside with costumers! So we got in pick up very few things Because we have No cart😗Lines was the worst I've ever seen ....Very slow service Horrible,even in self check out..
Then after getting whatever...I saw there was a spare cart by an employee and asked if I can have the cart,which She did responded In a passive aggressive way...NO MI AMOR YO NECESITO BLA BLA BLA....I Walked away 😒 I was so unsatisfied, it was her Stupid way of respond it was ugly. Can't stand messy employees. Sam please get more employees to help clean up the parking area,it was horrible fill with carts everywhere! And the one employee I ask for help was just rude. Not only that....it began to rain 😅🤣😭😫😿The Exit WAS BLOCKED,  and there a employee SCREAMING...GET OUT OF THE WAY....THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T ALLOW ANYONE TO BLOCK EXIT. It was So bad....almost everyone didn't wanted to get wet...which I understand....But me and my family prefer to get wet in the rain than stay in that chaos 😒 We walked out with the products in our hands everything got WET...it would be easier if I had a cart 🙄 could of cover my sh*t with the boxes 📦 at least 😒 So that was today...horrible experience.; Everything is good in the store although they do not have a variety of products. You have to go to other Sam's. but when I arrive at the exit we are required to show the receipt to the employee. The three pretty employees chatting made me wait more than 5 minutes for them to decide to serve me.; I love this Sam's club. They have a very well controlled environment with regards to the COVID pandemic. The staff is always nice and friendly. However, they don't always have all the products available, and it takes a long time to receive them. For example I been waiting for mora then 2 weeks on strawberries and an air mattress. Their chicken asada is delicious 😋.; This store needs training on what customer service means and on how to treat customers. They lack the correct attitude.

I had no cell signal since I was running around with the birthday set up details but arrived at the store at 7:30 PM to find that the store was closed and no arrangements were made to provide the service I had already paid for. The next day I showed up asking for a refund and a very nasty manager told me she didn’t have to help me in any way since the store policy covers her. Never buy anything here. The staff is highly insolent and arrogant, with the worst manners and store policies. PartyCity is much better, they helped me out in the end.; Double 5 Party Store.
I will never buy from this store again. On my birthday I ordered some pumps and paid for them as their policy requires. They would be ready that same day at night. Before leaving this store we asked what time they closed, they told us 9pm.
When we went to pick up the bombs the place was closed, it was 7:30pm.
It should be noted that before arriving at the Río Hondo mall, we called this store more than 10 times, without success.
Anyway, they didn't give me the service. The next day I called demanding my money back to which they responded with a TERRIBLE ATTITUDE “we can't do anything, we'll call you”
I never received their call and they didn't leave a message either. Their solution was to give me a loan that expired in a month.
I do not recommend this place. Better go to Party City, which was the one who solved it for us these days.; Excellent, there are many things for activities; Good assortment; Super attention I recommend"

From the moment I stepped through the door, I was greeted with energy and professionalism. The ambiance was very queer friendly, with elegant decor and comfortable seating.

The selection of drinks was impressive, ranging from classic cocktails to unique craft creations. The bartender Yanielys was  passionate, offering recommendations tailored to my taste preferences. Each drink was expertly crafted, bursting with flavor and made with high-quality ingredients.

The attention to detail at Nyorklounge is unparalleled. The staff goes above and beyond to ensure every patron feels valued and taken care of. Whether you’re a regular or a first-time visitor.

Overall, my experience at Nyorklounge was nothing short of exceptional. The combination of impeccable service, delicious drinks, make it a five-star establishment in every sense of the word. I can’t wait to return and create more wonderful memories at this hidden gem.; The place is not bad, but the security guard today 7/24/2024 is a very disrespectful and aggressive person with customers. If you want to be safe on the island, this is not the place. I tried to talk to a manager but no one is available. In Puerto Rico there are other places, not this one, nobody knows what could happen to you.; Great spot love the fact that it’s an open minded environment 🌈; Excellent service from the bartenders and a calm atmosphere. The best to hang out with friends and have drinks and shots.; "

He literally yelled ARE YOU AMERICAN because gratuity is not included. Well last time I checked gratuity isn’t guaranteed either if you are rude.
Disappointing.
We had asked what was included with the day pass prior to purchase  and the person I spoke with made it seem like it was more than just the pools and chairs. It felt a little like a bait and switch.

This is a tiny place with a few food options and a decently sized drink menu. Fish tacos were pretty good. Beer is beer. I did not care for my wife’s Cucumber Collins. Service was friendly enough, if not particularly quick. Were not offered menus. Prices as expected. Beautiful view of the beach across the street. Nice and refreshingly breezy.; If you’re on Carolina Beach, this is the perfect place to grab a small bite. The price is so cheap compared to surrounding places but the dishes are fulfilling. The limited menu packs a punch of flavor! 💥

I ordered two PORK TACOS with a side of BASIC NACHOS. The tacos were simple, pulled pork with a drizzle of cilantro lime sauce and pico de gallo. The pork was tender but dry, while the sauce helped - the bite felt like it was missing something.

The nachos were my favorite I’ve had on the island. Most would think the cheese makes nachos the best, but the cilantro lime sauce was certainly the star here. With a heap of pico de gallo and fresh cilantro, the flavors on these fresh crispy nachos was out of this world. I loved it.

If you order either item, get extra cilantro sauce and add something spicy…like a hot sauce or salsa. I definitely recommend this little spot for any meal on the beach. Small, quaint and absolutely delicious.; This place is fire!! After 8 years we had the chance to spend the Holidays back in our home Puerto Rico. We told the staff about our visit and they were so excited that they gave us free shots of Pitorro( Puerto rican moonshine) and we all had a toast to celebrate. If you want super cold beers, Vodka with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, freat food and friendly staff......this is the place!!!; it’s really cute place, but unfortunately not food. nachos aren’t good.; Layed back! Cool. An outdoor/ indoor bar/restaurant. A must, for the tourist. Very lively and breezy. Good food, and strong, yet tasty drinks! Salsa music playing in the background. Large screen T.V.'s for you Sports fans. Excellent collection of Salsa legends! Inviting decor. Handicap parking and entrance. Kids are always welcome! The waitresses are bilingual and friendly!

We literally had 0 issues during our week stay there. One elevator was still out of order but really never waited more than a minute or two to get up to our room on 8 floor. Fernando was awesome and helps us several times with bookings for excursions and just places to go in the mountains. Valet was spot on every time we needed it. This is rare for me but I really have not one thing negative to say about our experience there. Was absolutely perfect!!!; I can't talk highly enough about the staff and the professionalism at this hotel. It blew my expectations. You get beach towels and a beach chair included with your stay and the beach is literally right across the street from the hotel. The rooms are amazing, newly upgraded, beautiful shower in the room. The rooftop bar is a nice touch as well as the pool. Even though there was construction going on, I still would highly recommend this stay here. It's in a perfect location and walking distance from downtown. That also has restaurants and bars right near.; Worst experience I’ve ever had at a hotel.

1) there is construction going on. It is LOUD. They did not disclose this and lied about when/where it was taking place on inquiry.
2) there is a problem with THEFT. My rescue medications were stolen from our room.
3) I filed a report with the hotel regarding the above. When I called to request a copy (needed this to fill my script), they REFUSED. The manager was supposed to call me back, but she didn’t bother.

Pros: they did move us to a different room after problem #1, that was nice. Unfortunately this does not outweigh the price of ER visits and doctors visits I’ve incurred since the happened.

We will never go back. I’m usually the go-to for advice on going to PR among my friends and colleagues. I will be sure to advise them not to stay at this hotel.; Been here 4 times starting in 2009 was a great experience. Has went down hill every time. Room were designed terribly. Huge showers no counter space, edges of the bed stuck out cut my leg on them twice. Restaurant on the roof had no help decent food, way expensive construction noise almost non stop. Love Puerto Rico but if we decide to return it will have to be somewhere else.; The hotel was nice! Housekeeping was great ""Carmen"". The smell was pleasant, the sheets were high quality, the only hiccup was the shower ran cold on Multiple occasions, the issue was resolved  after a few calls downstairs but....getting out the shower to make the call ....ahh!

Good place to hang out at hotel after checking out.; Joel was amazing. He was incredibly helpful and took care of us the entire time of our stay. He was the best waiter we’ve ever had. Food was also delightful. Highly recommend.; Honestly, I just had the best snapper I’ve ever had. The seasoning was amazing, it was fried perfectly and came with the perfect sides. A snapper enjoyed is always eaten with the fingers and lemons. When nothing else but bones is left at the end you demolished it. And it’s huge. Very impressive size. Not photos unfortunately.
We had a couple of other items that were good too. The atmosphere on the patio was very nice. Run here if you like snapper.; The bartenders in the hotel bar are well trained, some are mixologists and  show a lot of talent for on the fly drink creations. I struggled with the menu, it was a short list of cocktails but the service was good, attentive and vocal about closing time as well as last call for food and drinks. Honestly 15-20$ a drink is what knocked the star off for me simply because the bar is in the middle of the lobby with no real ambiance to make it feel worth the high prices.; I stayed at the Royal Sonesta the last week of November 2022. The food at this restaurant, which is located in the hotel lobby, was awful and VERY expensive. I spent $30 on a 1/2 quesadilla that did not have any aromatics, seasonings, or herbs of any kind to give it flavor. It was just cheddar cheese and bland chicken in a store bought tortilla. It was so bad, I could not swallow it. I complained, and it took the restaurant manager about 30 minutes to come speak with me. She refused to provide a refund and instead gave me another horrible dish. This time, it was hotsauce and chicken on a store-bought piece of Flatbread. It was supposed to be a Buffalo Bleu cheese chicken Flatbread, but the ""cheese"" was nonexistant. It was just drizzled white sauce with no seasoning. Of course I didn't bother complaining again, so I just starved the first night and never returned.  There is no good restaurant off property nearby, so I don't recommend staying at this hotel. If you are only looking for a nice pool, it could work for you, but realize the rooms are also pretty worn and in need of renovation as well. There isn't much that is ""Royal"" about the Sonesta properties. Also, note that wi-fi isn't free there, unless you sign up for their marketing scam associated with it."

We called and they told us they opened at 10. We get there there the staff greets us we asked for every service basically. We asked for music the girl plays music off her phone. We then asked for hookah only for them to have only 2 hookah flavors. I asked for a strawberry margarita and the girl gave me a vodka and cranberry like wth. The dj finally came an hour later and he was really good the only good thing about this bar actually.

They’ll like you more when you tip. I was there two nights in a row and it was the same, DJ told me VIP was closed but when his friends came he let them in, he could of said VIP is for more than 2 ppl but instead he lied and said it was closed. Not angry but disappointed because puertoricans are blacks, and since being here for a week I’ve witnessed a lot of discrimination against ppl of color. Do better.; Y’all!! Women, carry your own toilet paper/wipes. I went to the toilet, no toilet paper, no soap to wash your hands after. When I asked for toilet paper I got handed a bunch of bar napkins.

Good music

This lounge and I now have an intimate relationship. Thanks to #jetblue we’ve been stuck here for two days. Lost nearly a $1000 in accommodation and transfer fees and very upset with the airline.
But anyway, yesterday we came here thinking we’d only be an hour or two, but it was 6 hours until they closed the doors and chucked everyone out. Which is a pain when at midnight you realise your flight is cancelled and they have to put you up in a hotel. Dehydrated and hungry for a real meal, we were very angry.
The lounge is small. I mean, very small. In one area, there are lovely club chairs but only 10 of them plus a half dozen side tables and a tv which seems to be preprogrammed to mainstream sport or game shows.
There is an area for business with desk space and another seating area which were closed off on our second visit.
The food is blah. Caesar salad the size of a serving for a child or pasta salad, again, not even a half cup full. The beans rice and meatballs were heated in a microwave, which melted the cling wrap onto the meal. Tossed it.
The bar is minimal. The usual drinks but don’t expect a sangria or pina colada. I settled for a gin and tonic or red wine.
Coffee machine looks good and there are plenty of soft drinks or beer.
Only one of the 4 small spaces have a departure board. Frustrating when your delays are coming in every half hour!
Staff aren’t inspired by their job but are generous with the vodka in a Bloody Mary. Woo hoo. Had to stop drinking.
No toilets here which means a 500m walk to the toilets between A2 a A3. Now that is crazy stupid!
Yesterday was crazy busy with so many Jet Blue flights cancelled. No seats and parents with little kids or those in a wheelchair were turned away to suffer at the boarding gate that they’d never get to use.
Abandoned by the lounge, and after four hours being told our flight was cancelled, we gave up.
Will never fly Jet Blue again.
Take me back to the #qantaslounge in Australia please.

#thewanderingreviewer #sanjuanpuertorico #globalloubgepuertorico #globalloungesanjuan #airportlounges; This was a complete mess, starting from the reception desk. I'm not used to this level of service at Priority Pass or any airline lounges. Totally worst lounge I have ever been in. In Europe, this couldn't be called a lounge. The space is furnished with Ikea furniture etc. and everything is a bit messy. Their food was served from pre-packaged meals that looked - well, really anemic. The open side of the airport (accessible to everyone) is cleaner and more comfortable than this.; Access thru AMEX PLAT/priority pass, located right after duty free on the way to international gates.
Very small lounge, was packed when we visited and very uncomfortable tall chairs in a very tight space.
Food and beverages were not self serve, 1/3 servers was very nice and hospitable, the other 2 almost made a face everytime you asked for anything.
Better than waiting at your gate tho ;); This is a very bad lounge. The staff is very nice and professional but the facility itself is too small  and the food selection is small. There are no bathrooms. This is a place to grab a quick bite of you don’t have any restrictions. Not relaxing. Only snack is seasoned peanuts. No crackers chips fruit or cheese. I noticed that they are due to open another location at the other terminal. I hope it gets better; Worst Lounge I have been in the US (territories).  Theres should be a better defined criteria for these lounges.  Service is obviously not free, you pay for it when you travel Business class, First or have access via Priority Pass.  The service was bad, almost nothing to eat and they kicked people out at 20:00.  Cleaning starts before so for the last 30 mins they closed the restrooms.  I had to complaint to get in just because if they close at 20:00 services should be available until 20:00.  I do NOT recommend it.  Unfortunately it seems in SJU you do not have any other option.  If you have limited accesses, save on this one."

New place trendy and Great atmosphere.  We had such a great experience. We met the owner super nice  place and welcoming. The waitress was super nice. We loved the decor and the food was ALL AMAZINGGGGG…

The menu isnt extensive but the food is delicious and reasonable prices.

The Toa Alta location is also amazing I visited in august 2023.

Cant wait to go back.; Keep in mind that the last few reviews placed by people within the last year showing pictures of this particular place... ARE FAKE and from an entire different location!!!

I got here and is a hole in the wall, shared with a psychiatrist's office... really?!?!.
Is supper small compared to the pictures shared by those called ""reviewers.""
Please be honest... unless you work here or know someone who does.

My family ordered everything pink on the menu, and to be different looking for protein, I ordered an omelets with meet which cost $17... although this was smaller than my cell phone (when measured from end to end) and about an inch thick. (I got robbed).
Is it acceptable that there's lots of food coloring in every meal and drink, but they should not be cheap on the food.

Those placing fake pictures of this place just to add customer traffic should be reported... this isn't right, and you all know it.

I'll post some Real pics of this place for clarity, transparency, and complete Honesty .

UPDATE:
I paid $120.11 for 2 adults and 2 kids.
For this amount of money, there are lots of better choices out there.

Don't get tricked with fake postings!!!; Quite the interesting little place they got there. Very small, but cozy. I hope you like the color pink, because that is the theme of the place... and the menu. With the exception of the eggs, everything on the menu is pink (or close to it): pancakes, waffles, toast, lattes, etc. Their service is very good and the prices are adequate. So, if you're in the area and breakfast hunting, by all means, give them a try.; The food is good, the service is awesome and the atmosphere is very relaxing. The place is really cute, and have a few beautiful spots for pictures.; LOVED LOVED LOVED this brunch spot! I would recommend putting a reservation PRIOR to going because the place is cozy! But everything about it is SO cute! I loved the food, the staff was super friendly and I was able to get SO many cute pics and videos for my reel. Follow me @ThisLatinaTravels for more details!

So come here because it’s a ten outta ten and no long lines; Very cool laid back restaurant. I went for brunch. There wasn't anyone else in the restaurant when we arrived so I was a little skeptical about the food. The service was very slow, I understand the culture is laid back, but for us to be the only ones in the restaurant it took a very long time for our coffee to come out and the waiter also forgot one.

The food was delicious! Large portion sizes and lots of flavor. I really enjoyed the pumpkin pancakes! Sweet enough to enjoy without syrup. The French toast was also delicious!!!!!; Today, I had the pleasure of finding Morena Bistro Bar. The food was very good, the drinks, ( both lattes and Mimosas) were amazing!!! The atmosphere was very nice and the service was awesome. Our server, Jahira, was awesome!!! She was very friendly and helpful. She gave us tips on several places to go see during our visit. She even took pics for us in front of the awesome hand painted murals on the wall before we left. I would definitely recommend Morena Bistro Bar to any and everyone. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!!!!; Such a gem! Our server Yahaira was absolutely lovely, and so was our meal. I got the Frutti Nutti (waffles with fruit + nutella + whipped cream), side of bacon and the lavender latte. All soooo yum!! I'm a picky eater and loved everything. Great location with beautiful murals and a convenient full-body mirror by the bathrooms. Large, colorful space with clean bathrooms. Me and my girlfriends loved this spot!"

I’ve been to some bad pool halls but, this was next level. A total cluster f#?!,the felt has never been brushed. There is no full set of billiard balls. The white ball is larger than the set.

Update your hours to reflect true hours of operation.

If you're going to serve alcohol, advertise it correctly. NO ONE wants to pay for a taxi just to end up at a closed bar....

Place is not open till 8am; this place looks really cool...however, it is a MAJOR joke. Only 1 (out of like 8 tables) ACTUALLY works. By that, I mean you actually get the RIGHT set of balls. This is not a concern of theirs. When expressing to the sole employee in the place that my table dispensed (2) 6-balls and (2) 13-balls...I was told that this is completely normal, and that the only table with the correct amount of balls was (1) green felt table that they charge $8 an hour to play on. This would be a great place for kids to practice...ya know...if it wasn't also an expensive bar. Why even have them there if they don't function properly? I understand them being reluctant on putting a sign outside that says ""ATTN CUSTOMERS: Our tables do not work properly""   If you actually want to play a legitimate game of pool...go to some bar in  Old San Juan. At least their tables actually work.; Great to hang with friends, but the pool tables often more than not have issues. Nonetheless, there's always someone to fix the situation. There's no 'chalk'. There's a bar. Competitive people~ (not so good when youre just trying to have fun, and mess up).

They have at least 9+ pool tables(a $1 per play). Opens till late~ if you're hungry there's a lot of local diners at walking distance!

Parking is a bit meh, but not hard to find!"

Not a lot of options.
While the portions are big it's not the most tasty of meals.
It's pricey because it's in the airport and you are stuck in that terminal.
All other options around are kinda awful too.
Idk the airport just need better options. You'll find people complaining about every place, but at least this place did NOT make me sick so 🤷🏽; Outrageously priced. Just paid $43 including a $5 tip for a cheeseburger meal as shown on the receipt. The quality of the burger is very low quality. The bread was hard and the fries were overcooked. Basically felt like I just got taking advantage of and got robbed..

Now that I'm leaving this review I should have read the reviews before entering but with the rush of the airport he was a little hard. You can tell that the owners or franchise owner or managers do not care about the reviews. There's no answer to any of the bad reviews; We had a 4+ hour layover at SJU and tried a few restaurants here. During our initial attempt to eat here, the dining area was very crowded. We ate at another restaurant and returned here an hour or so later for dessert. The hostess who seated the us was not courteous, nevertheless we ventured in. We ordered the key lime pie and chocolate lava cake. The chocolate lava was paired with vanilla ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce. My husband did not find the key lime pie appetizing. It’s a great place to have a drink, watch the planes or sports/games on the tv monitor while passing time.; We decided to grab a quick bite at Land Shark, conveniently located within the airport. The ambiance was welcoming and, to our delight, we were seated promptly. Our server, Dariana, was a ray of sunshine - attentive and genuinely friendly, which set a pleasant tone for our meal.

We started with drinks, opting for a rum-based frozen concoction that initially impressed us with its delicious blend. To accompany our drinks, we chose chips with queso and salsa. While the chips were a hit or miss in terms of seasoning, the dips, unfortunately, didn’t live up to our expectations. The salsa was reminiscent of a standard jar variety, and the queso was notably thick and bland.

For our mains, my husband tried the mushroom burger. While the burger’s overall quality was decent, it lacked the essential burst of flavors one would expect; the meat seemed unseasoned, making it rather plain. The fries, however, were a redeeming feature. I went for the Jumbo Crispy Coconut Shrimp, which was a delight. Crusted perfectly with coconut and fried to a golden hue, the shrimp was the highlight of our meal. The fries accompanying it were equally delicious. A minor hiccup occurred with the dipping sauces, as they were out of both sweet pineapple and cocktail sauces, offering ranch instead.

We decided to round off with another round of drinks. Unfortunately, the second experience didn’t match the first. My repeat order felt runny and less flavorful, while the hubby’s new choice was also underwhelming.

While the prices seemed a tad high, we chalked it up to the airport location. Despite the culinary missteps, the excellent service made our experience worthwhile. We would consider returning to Land Shark, perhaps giving other menu items a chance, and hoping for a more consistent experience with the drinks.; I wouldn’t usually care enough about an airport “restaurant” if the food was half decent but I feel compelled to warn people about this place.
I had the greasiest and rankest chips which I wasn’t able to finish as I started to feel sick. I had no time or willingness to confront the waiter about it before my flight so I ate a few and left.
Speaking of the waiter; he was the reason for me to actually write a bad review as he was the most dismissive, inattentive and unkind (borderline rude) person I’ve had to deal with during my stay in beautiful Puerto Rico.
He acted as if he did not want to be there and by extension, made me feel incredibly unwelcomed, had a terrible attitude from the moment I arrived to the hostess stand, to seating me, to me ordering and even paying the bill. I regret having left a tip now.

Every local, regardless of them being in the service industry or not have been the friendliest and loveliest people I have encountered in my many travels, so this being the last interaction I had with a Puertorican before leaving the island leaves a bad taste to what had been an incredible journey so far.

I can’t speak for the rest of the menu as my options were limited so the rest of the dishes may be great but I wouldn’t visit an establishment where I’m treated like this even if it had Michelin stars.

It was AFTER all of this happened that I saw all the other bad reviews so I guess I need to read up before choosing where to eat in the future.

Although I could identify the gentleman by name I have decided not to as I don’t want to potentially have a negative impact on the life of a person who may have just been having a bad day, but I doubt this is the case so I suggest the establishment to have a talk with all of their staff and give them an attitude check.

Best of luck"

The course is very nice for a municipal course but also very challenging as the fairways tend to be narrow and water is always around, so play conservatively if you’re a higher handicap like me. The facilities are very good and they have everything a golfer would want. When originally booking, I couldn’t find a course near San Juan that had tee times available before noon on weekends, so I emailed the Pro Shop and they replied promptly with a morning tee time so I could make my evening cruise boarding.; A fairly well-maintained public golf course, the restaurant areas, the activity lounges, and the gazebo are spectacular.; Beautiful view at night, great food and cocktails. Perfect for parties and reunions.; Golf course is in rough shape. Great views of the highway and massive power lines. Rude starter that won’t let you tee off at your tee time unless you are paired so we had to wait for someone to arrive. Way too expensive for what it is. 2 players with rental clubs was $250. Don’t mind paying that for a nice course but laughable for this one.; The food is good, at least for lunch. The prices are reasonable and service is ok. Local food with the expected taste."

They have great membership offers that give you access to three complexes (San Juan, Bayamón, Caguas), which for me Bayamón is the best. The customer service is great and the trainers help you when they see you in doubt. Regardless of that, there are multiple reasons why I don’t rate them a 4 or 5 star. First of all, I don’t like their machines. The machines are old and moldy, I struggle every time I try to adjust them and that doesn’t motivate me to go to gym if I’m being honest. The bathrooms in Bayamón don’t have air conditioning so they smell awful every time and the shower water is always cold. In San Juan, parking is always a pain. Never been to Caguas so I can’t comment about it. Overall not a bad gym but it’s not the best. For the membership cost, I’ll say it’s a good deal but again, not the best. It does offer classes but I’ll say they aren’t for beginners. I come from a gym that the ambience felt like family (it closed so that’s why I enrolled in WFC) and I sadly didn’t found that ambience here.; great place to train. the staff is very helpful and have alot of knowledge.; I have been trying to cancel my membership for a year now.
I was a deployed soldier and went to the facility a couple days before departure, but they couldn’t cancel the membership because the manager was not there.
While deployed, I called trying to cancel and they said I could only cancel membership in person
Now that I’m back, I went to the gym but “the manager doesn’t work weekends”
Finally during my last two tries, “the manager is not here right now, come later”

Really easy to sign up and charge your bank account, but horrible options for when you want to cancel.; Nice gym, friendly family environment here.; Having fun here. People are friendly helpful and very professional"

I could see myself buying one or two things here like vinegar beer or soy sauce in bulk. Prices are good for some things and average on others. Didn’t expert them to have groceries such as meat, cheese and veggies which was a nice thing. Just make sure you look at the dates and check everything. Saw a pack of salami that was gray brown and definitely not edible anymore.; A very Good variety of products for Stores and home use. So affordable prices. Some employees have to change their mind to customer service.; Decent prices, I did but some items that were in the markdown basket and had the marked down price but they would not honor it so I ended up buy less and paying full price. Other than that is was a decent place to shop you do not need a membership.; This is a bit of a mixed bag situation. I frequent here consistently for work, but my experience is never the same.

There's always one or another product they're missing, service is sometimes great and speedy and other times painfully slow.

As an example, the last time I went the cashier spent more time looking for the price of a single product than actually scanning the rest of the items I was purchasing. The crazy part? This isn't the first time I have the same issue with the exact same product.

Their system seems to rely on each employee having a notebook were they write down the code of items without barcodes (happens a lot if you buy large boxes of things) but if that employee doesn't have it written down they have to ask another, and if that employee doesn't... Well you can see where this goes.

What this ends up creating is a situation where you can be in and out in minutes and others you can be in and out in double that time.

I would honestly rate it higher if they had a better system for handling these situations. The employees are usually very speedy and helpful when not faced with these obstacles, but an antiquated point of sales system won't allow them to provide a more consistent experience.; Think a small Sam's or Costco store. Montalvo has a good variety of products in bulk, and awesome prices. You'll find goods ranging from spices, candies, canned goods, beers and spirits and tons of restaurant style containers.
They also have a meat section, if you want to buy in bulk (although they do offer some loose items).
It's great for making your hurricane prep purchases."
